Released in January 2011 in Japan , it is the third game in the Valkyria series .

       " \" As with previous <unk> Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \\n\",\n",
       " ' The game \\'s battle system , the <unk> system , is carried over directly from <unk> Chronicles . During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters \\' turns . Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge . Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . Each character has specific \" Potentials \" , skills unique to each character . They are divided into \" Personal Potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" Battle Potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique \" Masters Table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge , the character <unk> can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . \\n',\n",

Ordered by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , <unk> <unk> , meaning \" Always Ready . \" The three main characters are No.7 Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace No.1 Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and No.13 Riela <unk> , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria .

While at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . One such member , <unk> , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of Calamity Raven , attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader , Dahau . At the same time , elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests . Hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the Gallian war effort .

       " \" Partly due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower Gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the Empire , the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force .

       " ' Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . The director of Valkyria Chronicles II , Takeshi Ozawa , returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III . Development work took approximately one year . After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the \" revolutionary \" idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 . Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series \\' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform . In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by <unk> The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe , while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii , Koichi Majima , <unk> Miyagi , Seiki <unk> and Takayuki <unk> . Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor . \\n',\n",
       " \" The majority of material created for previous games , such as the <unk> system and the design of maps , was carried over . Alongside this , improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character 's body . In order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay . The newer systems were decided upon early in development . The character designs were done by <unk> Honjou , who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When creating the Nameless Squad , Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world . The main color of the Nameless was black . As with the previous Valkyria games , Valkyria Chronicles III used the <unk> graphics engine . The anime opening was produced by Production I.G. \\n\",\n",

An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . He <unk> the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game \\'s ending . The battle themes were designed around the concept of a \" modern battle \" divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . The game \\'s opening theme song , \" If You Wish for ... \" ( <unk> , <unk> Kimi ga <unk> Nara ) , was sung by Japanese singer May \\'n .

Reaching 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) in width , this species has a diamond @-@ shaped , grayish green pectoral fin disc . Its short , whip @-@ like tail has alternating black and white bands and fin folds above and below . There are short rows of thorns on the back and the base of the tail , but otherwise the skin is smooth . While this species possesses the dark mask @-@ like pattern across its eyes common to its genus , it is not ornately patterned like other maskrays . \\n',\n",
       " ' Benthic in nature , the plain maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms , and to a lesser extent on small bony fishes . It is viviparous , with females producing litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" ) . This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls , which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build . As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it as Near Threatened . \\n',\n",

The holotype is a male 21 @.@ 2 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) across , caught off Western Australia ; several paratypes were also designated . Last tentatively placed the species in the genus Dasyatis , noting that it belonged to the \" maskray \" species group that also included the bluespotted stingray ( then Dasyatis kuhlii ) . In 2008 , Last and William White elevated the kuhlii group to the rank of full genus as Neotrygon , on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic evidence . \\n',\n",

The divergence of the N. annotata lineage was estimated to have occurred ~ 54 Ma . Furthermore , the individuals sequenced in the study sorted into two genetically distinct clades , suggesting that N. annotata is a cryptic species complex . The two putative species were estimated to have diverged ~ 4 @.@ 9 Ma ; the precipitating event was likely the splitting of the ancestral population by coastline changes . \\n',\n",

The tower was built between 1578 and 1580 to a design by the Bolognese architect Ottaviano Mascherino ( who was credited with building the Apostolic Palace ) mainly to promote the study of astronomy for the Gregorian Calendar Reform which was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and promulgated in 1582 . It was then also known as the Tower of Winds . The tower is now called the \" <unk> Astronomica Vaticana \" , the Vatican Observatory . Four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established .

The directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in the Vatican and equip it with the \" greatest and best instruments of the time \" . The design was effected after a series of meetings of the experts who had been appointed to reform the Julian calendar , in use since 45 BC , to verify their proposed reforms . Fr . Christoph Clavius , a Jesuit mathematician from the Roman College , was the expert on the committee who suggested the new system for the observations . The 73 metres ( 240 ft ) tower was then built above the museum and library , flanked by the Belvedere and della Pigna courtyards . The instrumentation for the observation of the sun rays falling over it consisted of a meridian line designed by Ignazio <unk> of Perugia . It was in the form of a circular marble plate in the centre , embellished with scientific designs . The tower still remains today , but has undergone improvements over the centuries . \\n',\n",

Earlier in 1797 , Pius VI gave approval to placing a Latin inscription <unk> Vaticana at the entrance to the upper part of the tower , which was implemented by Cardinal <unk> with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower 's observatory . The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI . Its instrumentation , apart from many normal devices ( such as meteorological and magnetic equipment , with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock , ) was noted for the <unk> Telescope . The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse , appearance of comets , Satellites of Jupiter and Mercury ’ s transit . As an addition , under the patronage of Pope Pius X , four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) long fortification walls , more than a thousand years old . Mgr . Gilii , highly respected as a polyglot with a knowledge of physics , biology , archeology and the Hebrew language , was in charge of the observatory from 1800 to 1821 . He carried out continuous meteorological observations ( twice a day at 6 AM and 2 PM ) conforming to the programme of the Mannheim Meteorological Society . While the observation records for seven years were published , the balance data in a manuscript form was preserved in the Vatican Library . Subsequent to Gilii 's death in 1821 , the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the Roman College . Established in 1787 , it was considered more suitable for making observations than the Vatican . \\n\",\n",

At the west end of this bridge , a four @-@ inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion .

She was converted from a Scottish @-@ built blockade runner named Fingal by the Confederacy after she made one run to Savannah , Georgia . After several failed attempts to attack Union blockaders , the ship was captured by two Union monitors in 1863 when she ran aground . Atlanta was floated off , repaired , and rearmed , serving in the Union Navy for the rest of the war . She spent most of her time deployed on the James River supporting Union forces there . The ship was decommissioned in 1865 and placed in reserve .

       " \" Fingal was designed and built as a merchantman by J & G Thomson 's Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard at Govan in Glasgow , Scotland , and was completed early in 1861 . She was described by Midshipman Dabney Scales , who served on the Atlanta before her battle with the monitors , as being a two @-@ masted , iron @-@ hulled ship 189 feet ( 57 @.@ 6 m ) long with a beam of 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) . She had a draft of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) and a depth of hold of 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) . He estimated her tonnage at around 700 tons bm . Fingal was equipped with two vertical single @-@ cylinder direct @-@ acting steam engines using steam generated by one flue @-@ tubular boiler . The engines drove the ship at a top speed of around 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . They had a bore of 39 inches ( 991 mm ) and a stroke of 30 inches ( 762 mm ) . \\n\",\n",
       " \" The ship briefly operated between Glasgow and other ports in Scotland for Hutcheson 's West Highland Service before she was purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch , the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy , to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased . To disguise his control of Fingal , and the destination of her cargo , Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas . The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October , although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead , Wales . On the night 14 / 15 October , as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead , Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig <unk> , slowly swinging at anchor without lights . Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched a letter to his financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig 's owners because he could not afford to take the time to deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained . The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and , after leaving port on 7 November , Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer 's real destination was Savannah , Georgia ; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau . However , all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade . Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders . \\n\",\n",
       " \" While Fingal was discharging her cargo , Bulloch went to Richmond to confer with Stephen Mallory , Secretary of the Navy . Mallory endorsed Bulloch 's plan to load Fingal with cotton to sell on the Navy Department 's account to be used to purchase more ships and equipment in Europe . He returned to Savannah on 23 November and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal . He made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 December , but it proved impossible to do as the Union controlled every channel from Savannah , aided by their occupation of Tybee Island at the mouth of the Savannah River . Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to Europe some other way . \\n\",\n",

       " ' The brothers Asa and Nelson Tift received the contract to convert the blockade runner into an ironclad in early 1862 with the name of Atlanta , after the city in Georgia . This was largely financed by contributions from the women of Savannah . Fingal was cut down to her main deck and large wooden sponsons were built out from the sides of her hull to support her casemate . After the conversion , Atlanta was 204 feet ( 62 @.@ 2 m ) long overall and had a beam of 41 feet ( 12 m ) . Her depth of hold was now 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) and she now had a draft of 15 feet 9 inches ( 4 @.@ 8 m ) . Atlanta now displaced 1 @,@ 006 long tons ( 1 @,@ 022 t ) and her speed was estimated at 7 – 10 knots ( 13 – 19 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 – 11 @.@ 5 mph ) . \\n',\n",
       " \" The armor of the casemate was angled at 30 ° from the horizontal and made from two layers of railroad rails , rolled into plates 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick and 7 inches ( 180 mm ) wide . The outer layer ran vertically and the inner layer horizontally . Her armor was backed by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of oak , vertically oriented , and two layers of 7 @.@ 5 inches ( 191 mm ) of pine , alternating in direction . The bottom of the casemate was some 20 inches ( 508 mm ) from the waterline and its top was 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) above the waterline . The pyramidal pilothouse was armored in the same way and had room for two men . The upper portion of Atlanta 's hull received two inches of armor . \\n\",\n",
       " ' The rectangular casemate was pierced with eight narrow gun ports , one each at the bow and stern and three along each side . Each gun port was protected by an armored shutter made of two layers of iron riveted together and allowed the guns to elevate only to a maximum of + 5 to + 7 ° . Atlanta was armed with single @-@ banded , 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) Brooke rifles on pivot mounts at the bow and stern . The middle gun port on each side was occupied by a single @-@ banded , 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 163 mm ) Brooke rifle .

Atlanta was also armed with a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) , solid iron , ram that was reinforced by a series of vertical steel bars . In front of the ram was a spar torpedo that carried 50 pounds ( 23 kg ) of black powder on a wooden pole connected to an iron lever that could be raised or lowered by means of pulleys . \\n',\n",
       " ' On 31 July 1862 , under the command of Lieutenant Charles H. McBlair , Atlanta conducted her sea trials down the Savannah River toward Fort Pulaski . The ship proved to be difficult to steer , and the additional weight of her armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft . This latter was a real problem in the shallow waters near Savannah . She also leaked significantly , and her design virtually eliminated air circulation . One report said that \" it was almost intolerable on board the Atlanta , there being no method of ventilation , and the heat was intense . \" Scales commented in his diary , \" What a comfortless , infernal and God @-@ forsaken ship ! ! \" \\n',\n",
       " \" Attempts were made to fix the problems and were at least partially successful in stopping many of the leaks . The ship was commissioned on 22 November and became the flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall , commander of the naval defenses of Georgia . Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships , Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863 , but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner , despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so . It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived before the end of January . Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February , but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so . After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March , Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal , South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston . Deserters revealed Tatnall 's plan while he was waiting at the head of <unk> Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal . Dissatisfied with Tattnall 's perceived lack of aggressiveness , Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page . Page , in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb ; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time . \\n\",\n",
       " \" Webb demonstrated his aggressiveness when he attempted to sortie on the first spring tide ( 30 May ) after taking command , but Atlanta 's forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions , and the ship ran aground . She was not damaged although it took over a day to pull her free . He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide , rejecting Mallory 's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad Savannah was finished before his next sortie . In the meantime , Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont , commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron , had ordered the monitors Weehawken and Nahant into <unk> Sound . Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the two ships . \\n\",\n",
       " ' In the early evening of 15 June , Webb began his next attempt by passing over the lower obstructions in the Wilmington River and spent the rest of the night coaling . He moved forward the next evening to a concealed position within easy reach of the monitors for an attack early the following morning . Webb planned to sink one of the monitors with his spar torpedo and then deal with the other one with his guns . The gunboat <unk> and the tugboat Resolute were to accompany him to tow one or both of the monitors back to Savannah . \\n',\n",
       " \" A lookout aboard Weehawken spotted Atlanta at 04 : 10 on the morning of 17 June . When the latter ship closed to within about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) of the two Union ships , she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over Weehawken and landed near Nahant . Shortly afterward , Atlanta ran aground on a sandbar ; she was briefly able to free herself , but the pressure of the tide pushed her back onto the sandbar . This time Webb was unable to get off and the monitors closed the range . When Weehawken , the leading ship , closed to within 200 – 300 yards ( 180 – 270 m ) she opened fire with both of her guns . The 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) shell missed , but the 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) shell struck the ironclad above the port middle gun port , penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it , spraying splinters and fragments that disabled the entire gun crew and half the crew of the bow gun , even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through the backing . The next shot from the 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren gun struck the upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate the two @-@ inch armor there . The next shell from the 15 @-@ inch Dahlgren glanced off the middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened , wounding half the gun 's crew with fragments . The final shell was also from the 15 @-@ inch Dahlgren and it struck the top of the pilothouse , breaking the armor there and wounding both pilots in it . By this time , Atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots , none of which hit either Union ship , and was hard aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half . Weehawken and Nahant were able to freely maneuver into positions from which the Atlanta 's narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance futile . Webb surrendered his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire , before Nahant even had a chance to fire . Of the ironclad 's 21 officers and 124 enlisted men , one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization . \\n\",\n",

Atlanta was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and spent most of her time stationed up the James River where she could support operations against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the ironclads of the James River Squadron . On 21 May 1864 , she and the gunboat Dawn fired on and dispersed Confederate cavalry that was attacking Fort Powhatan and she was deployed further upriver in February 1865 after the Battle of Trent 's Reach to better blockade the Confederate ironclads at Richmond . \\n\",\n",

       " \" Ancient Egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt . The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion , which emerged sometime in prehistory . Deities represented natural forces and phenomena , and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat , or divine order . After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100 BC , the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh , who claimed to be the gods ' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out . \\n\",\n",

Deities ' diverse appearances in art — as animals , humans , objects , and combinations of different forms — also alluded , through symbolism , to their essential features . \\n\",\n",
       " ' In different eras , various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society , including the solar deity Ra , the mysterious god Amun , and the mother goddess Isis . The highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life @-@ giving power of the sun . Some scholars have argued , based in part on Egyptian writings , that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities . Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world , except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC , when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten . \\n',\n",

People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines , for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites .

Allen estimates that more than 1 @,@ 400 deities are named in Egyptian texts , whereas his colleague Christian Leitz says there are \" thousands upon thousands \" of gods . \\n',\n",
       " ' The Egyptian language \\'s terms for these beings were nṯr , \" god \" , and its feminine form <unk> , \" goddess \" . Scholars have tried to discern the original nature of the gods by proposing etymologies for these words , but none of these suggestions has gained acceptance , and the terms \\' origin remains obscure . The hieroglyphs that were used as ideograms and determinatives in writing these words show some of the traits that the Egyptians connected with divinity . The most common of these signs is a flag flying from a pole . Similar objects were placed at the entrances of temples , representing the presence of a deity , throughout ancient Egyptian history . Other such hieroglyphs include a falcon , reminiscent of several early gods who were depicted as falcons , and a seated male or female deity . The feminine form could also be written with an egg as determinative , connecting goddesses with creation and birth , or with a cobra , reflecting the use of the cobra to depict many female deities . \\n',\n",
       " ' The Egyptians distinguished <unk> , \" gods \" , from <unk> , \" people \" , but the meanings of the Egyptian and the English terms do not match perfectly . The term nṯr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life . Deceased humans were called nṯr because they were considered to be like the gods , whereas the term was rarely applied to many of Egypt \\'s lesser supernatural beings , which modern scholars often call \" demons \" . Egyptian religious art also depicts places , objects , and concepts in human form . These personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings , only mentioned once or twice , that may be little more than metaphors . \\n',\n",
       " ' Confronting these blurred distinctions between gods and other beings , scholars have proposed various definitions of a \" deity \" . One widely accepted definition , suggested by Jan Assmann , says that a deity has a cult , is involved in some aspect of the universe , and is described in mythology or other forms of written tradition . According to a different definition , by Dimitri Meeks , nṯr applied to any being that was the focus of ritual . From this perspective , \" gods \" included the king , who was called a god after his coronation rites , and deceased souls , who entered the divine realm through funeral ceremonies .

Deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding Predynastic Period ( before 3100 BC ) and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs . Predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures . Some of these images , such as stars and cattle , are reminiscent of important features of Egyptian religion in later times , but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities . As Egyptian society grew more sophisticated , clearer signs of religious activity appeared . The earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era , along with images that resemble the iconographies of known deities : the falcon that represents Horus and several other gods , the crossed arrows that stand for Neith , and the enigmatic \" Set animal \" that represents Set . \\n',\n",
       " \" Many Egyptologists and anthropologists have suggested theories about how the gods developed in these early times . Gustave <unk> , for instance , thought the Egyptians first revered primitive fetishes , then deities in animal form , and finally deities in human form , whereas Henri Frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning . Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic , and more current ones , such as Siegfried Morenz ' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment , are difficult to prove . \\n\",\n",
       " ' Predynastic Egypt originally consisted of small , independent villages . Because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular towns and regions , many scholars have suggested that the pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states , spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities . But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were , like other elements of Egyptian culture , present all across the country despite the political divisions within it . \\n',\n",
       " ' The final step in the formation of Egyptian religion was the unification of Egypt , in which rulers from Upper Egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country . These sacred kings and their subordinates assumed the exclusive right to interact with the gods , and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion . \\n',\n",
       " ' New gods continued to emerge after this transformation . Some important deities like Isis and Amun are not known to have appeared until the Old Kingdom ( c . 2686 – 2181 BC ) . Places and concepts could suddenly inspire the creation of a deity to represent them , and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite @-@ sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses .

Gods could share the same role in nature ; Ra , Atum , <unk> , Horus , and other deities acted as sun gods . Despite their diverse functions , most gods had an overarching role in common : maintaining maat , the universal order that was a central principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess . But some deities represented disruption to maat . Most prominently , Apep was the force of chaos , constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe , and Set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it . \\n\",\n",

These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory . Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos .

The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris ' murder , in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat . The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky , sink into the Duat at night , and emerge as a young child at dawn . In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of primordial chaos . Funerary texts that depict Ra 's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him . Instead of being <unk> immortal , the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation , thus renewing the whole world .

Most events of mythology , set in a time before the gods ' withdrawal from the human realm , take place in an earthly setting . The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky .

This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth . As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities , the god in a city 's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region . Deities ' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over . Many gods had more than one cult center , and their local ties changed over time . They could establish themselves in new cities , or their range of influence could contract .

Reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism , which might suggest that all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one , and the tendency of Egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities . Another point of contention is the appearance of the word \" god \" in wisdom literature , where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities . In the early 20th century , for instance , E. A. Wallis Budge believed that Egyptian commoners were polytheistic , but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite , who wrote the wisdom literature . His contemporary James Henry <unk> thought Egyptian religion was instead pantheistic , with the power of the sun god present in all other gods , while Hermann Junker argued that Egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in the course of its history . \\n',\n",
       " ' In 1971 , Erik Hornung published a study rebutting these views . He points out that in any given period many deities , even minor ones , were described as superior to all others . He also argues that the unspecified \" god \" in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to revere . Although the combinations , manifestations , and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting , they were always restricted to a finite number of forms , never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way . <unk> , Hornung says , describes Egyptian religion better than other labels . An Egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment , without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on . Hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth , at the time before creation , after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence . \\n',\n",
       " ' Hornung \\'s arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion , but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows . Jan Assmann maintains that the notion of a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom , beginning with a focus on Amun @-@ Ra as the all @-@ important sun god . In his view , Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend . It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods . Then , in the backlash against Atenism , priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way , one that coexisted with traditional polytheism . The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities , while at the same time , the multiple gods were aspects of the one . According to Assmann , this one god was especially equated with Amun , the dominant god in the late New Kingdom , whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods . James P. Allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the \" multiplicity of approaches \" in Egyptian thought , as well as with the <unk> practice of ordinary worshippers . He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by \" identifying their uniform notion of \\' god \\' with a particular god , depending on the particular situation . \" \\n',\n",

The Egyptians \\' visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal .

For this reason , the funerary god Anubis is commonly shown in Egyptian art as a dog or jackal , a creature whose scavenging habits threaten the preservation of buried mummies , in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection .

These forms include men and women ( anthropomorphism ) , animals ( <unk> ) , and , more rarely , inanimate objects . Combinations of forms , such as gods with human bodies and animal heads , are common . New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history .

For instance , the horse , which was only introduced in the Second Intermediate Period ( c . 1650 – 1550 BC ) , never represented a god .

Other gods were also said to govern the length of human lives , including <unk> , who presided over birth , and Shai , the personification of fate . Thus the time and manner of death was the main meaning of the Egyptian concept of fate , although to some extent these deities governed other events in life as well . Several texts refer to gods influencing or inspiring human decisions , working through a person \\'s \" heart \" — the seat of emotion and intellect in Egyptian belief . Deities were also believed to give commands , instructing the king in the governance of his realm and regulating the management of their temples . Egyptian texts rarely mention direct commands given to private persons , and these commands never evolved into a set of divinely enforced moral codes . Morality in ancient Egypt was based on the concept of maat , which , when applied to human society , meant that everyone should live in an orderly way that did not interfere with the well @-@ being of other people . Because deities were the upholders of maat , morality was connected with them . For example , the gods judged humans \\' moral righteousness after death , and by the New Kingdom , a verdict of innocence in this judgment was believed to be necessary for admittance into the afterlife . But in general , morality was based on practical ways to uphold maat in daily life , rather than on strict rules that the gods laid out . \\n',\n",
       " \" Humans had free will to ignore divine guidance and the behavior required by maat , but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves . A deity carried out this punishment using its ba , the force that manifested the god 's power in the human world . Natural disasters and human ailments were seen as the work of angry divine bas . Conversely , the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans . Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities : Shed , who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm , and <unk> , an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing . \\n\",\n",
       " \" Egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly . Misfortune was often seen as a product of <unk> , the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat , and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events . Some deities who were closely connected with <unk> , such as Set , could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods . But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery , while others give theodicies in the gods ' defense . Beginning in the Middle Kingdom , several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth . Because of this human misbehavior , the creator is distant from his creation , allowing suffering to exist . New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom . They emphasize humans ' direct , personal relationships with deities and the gods ' power to intervene in human events . People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives . As a result , upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods ' favor as a way to guarantee a good life . Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid , and after the New Kingdom came to an end , government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods ' will . \\n\",\n",

       " \" Official religious practices , which maintained maat for the benefit of all Egypt , were related to , but distinct from , the religious practices of ordinary people , who sought the gods ' help for their personal problems . \\n\",\n",
       " \" Official religion involved a variety of rituals , based in temples . Some rites were performed every day , whereas others were festivals , taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity . The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies , in which their statues were clothed , anointed , and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor . These offerings , in addition to maintaining maat for the gods , celebrated deities ' life @-@ giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful . \\n\",\n",
       " \" Festivals often involved a ceremonial procession in which a cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque @-@ shaped shrine . These processions served various purposes . In Roman times , when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation , processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood . Processions also traveled between temples , as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu . Rituals for a god were often based in that deity 's mythology . Such rituals were meant to be repetitions of the events of the mythic past , renewing the beneficial effects of the original events . In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris , his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout . The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god 's own life . \\n\",\n",
       " \" Personal interaction with the gods took many forms . People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles , run by temples , that were supposed to convey gods ' answers to questions . Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well @-@ being or to impart the god 's positive characteristics to the wearer . Private rituals invoked the gods ' power to accomplish personal goals , from healing sickness to cursing enemies . These practices used heka , the same force of magic that the gods used , which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune . The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth , or even threatened a deity , to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal . Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers , and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help . \\n\",\n",
       " ' Prayer and private offerings are generally called \" personal piety \" : acts that reflect a close relationship between an individual and a god . Evidence of personal piety is scant before the New Kingdom . Votive offerings and personal names , many of which are <unk> , suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods . But firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the New Kingdom , reaching a peak late in that era . Scholars disagree about the meaning of this change — whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions . Egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples . They recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae . They gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to , or that symbolized the result they desired ; thus a relief image of Hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility . Occasionally , a person took a particular god as a patron , dedicating his or her property or labor to the god \\'s cult . These practices continued into the latest periods of Egyptian history . These later eras saw more religious innovations , including the practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form , such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess Bastet . Some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship , but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition . \\n',\n",
       " \" The worship of some Egyptian gods spread to neighboring lands , especially to Canaan and Nubia during the New Kingdom , when those regions were under pharaonic control . In Canaan , the exported deities , including Hathor , Amun , and Set , were often syncretized with native gods , who in turn spread to Egypt . The Egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in Canaan , and their importance there waned after Egypt lost control of the region . In contrast , many temples to the major Egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in Nubia . After the end of Egyptian rule there , the imported gods , particularly Amun and Isis , were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of Nubia 's independent Kingdom of Kush . These gods were incorporated into the Nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in Egypt , so that Amun was considered the divine father of the king and Isis and other goddesses were linked with the Nubian queen , the <unk> . Some deities reached farther . <unk> became a goddess in Minoan Crete , and Amun 's oracle at Siwa Oasis was known to and consulted by people across the Mediterranean region . \\n\",\n",
       " \" Under the Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty and then Roman rule , Greeks and Romans introduced their own deities to Egypt . These newcomers equated the Egyptian gods with their own , as part of the Greco @-@ Roman tradition of interpretatio graeca . But the worship of the native gods was not swallowed up by that of foreign ones . Instead , Greek and Roman gods were adopted as manifestations of Egyptian ones . Egyptian cults sometimes incorporated Greek language , philosophy , iconography , and even temple architecture . Meanwhile , the cults of several Egyptian deities — particularly Isis , Osiris , Anubis , the form of Horus named Harpocrates , and the fused Greco @-@ Egyptian god Serapis — were adopted into Roman religion and spread across the Roman Empire . Roman emperors , like Ptolemaic kings before them , invoked Isis and Serapis to endorse their authority , inside and outside Egypt . In the empire 's complex mix of religious traditions , Thoth was transmuted into the legendary esoteric teacher Hermes Trismegistus , and Isis , who was venerated from Britain to Mesopotamia , became the focus of a Greek @-@ style mystery cult . Isis and Hermes Trismegistus were both prominent in the Western esoteric tradition that grew from the Roman religious world . \\n\",\n",
       " \" Temples and cults in Egypt itself declined as the Roman economy deteriorated in the third century AD , and beginning in the fourth century , Christians suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities . The last formal cults , at Philae , died out in the fifth or sixth century . Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years , remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries . But many of the practices involved in their worship , such as processions and oracles , were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted as part of the Coptic Church . Given the great changes and diverse influences in Egyptian culture since that time , scholars disagree about whether any modern Coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion . But many festivals and other traditions of modern Egyptians , both Christian and Muslim , resemble the worship of their ancestors ' gods . \\n\",\n",

       " ' General aviation in the United Kingdom has been defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation . Although the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition , some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation ( GA ) in the UK . The sector operates business jets , rotorcraft , piston and jet @-@ engined fixed @-@ wing aircraft , gliders of all descriptions , and lighter than air craft . Public transport operations include business ( or corporate ) aviation and air taxi services , and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector . Other commercial GA activities are aerial work , such as surveying and air ambulances , and flight training , which plays an important role in the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport ( CAT ) industry . Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation . It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement , and encompasses a range of air sports , such as racing , aerobatics , and parachuting , at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition . \\n',\n",
       " ' Of the 21 @,@ 000 civil aircraft registered in the UK , 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations , and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1 @.@ 25 and 1 @.@ 35 million hours flown . The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed @-@ wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA , but the main area of growth over the last 20 years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft , such as microlights , amateur built aeroplanes , and smaller helicopters . There are 28 @,@ 000 Private Pilot Licence holders , and 10 @,@ 000 certified glider pilots . Some of the 19 @,@ 000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities . Although GA operates from more than 1 @,@ 800 aerodromes and landing sites , ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips , over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes . The GA industry , which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin , employs 12 @,@ 000 people , and contributes £ 1 @.@ 4 billion to the UK economy . \\n',\n",
       " ' GA is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) , although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) . The main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing , and the objective is to promote high standards of safety . At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies , and gliding is in transition from a self @-@ regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA . Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted . The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector , and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re @-@ development for more profitable uses . The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations , and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market . The planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome @-@ related environmental issues which , particularly regarding noise , are the main subjects of public criticism levelled at GA . \\n',\n",

In 1910 the Aero Club was granted the Royal prefix , took responsibility for controlling all private flying in the UK , and started issuing the first British pilot licences . The introduction of the de Havilland DH.60 Moth in 1925 revolutionised light aviation , and the Royal Aero Club , recognising the \" vital necessity of promoting civil flying \" , formed the Light Aeroplane Club scheme .

The bombardment of Montenegro was part of the larger Austro @-@ Hungarian campaign against the Kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia , who were members of the Entente , during the first half of 1915 . The attack on Ancona was an immense success , and the ships were unopposed during the operation . The bombardment of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an Italian steamer in the port of Ancona itself , and an Italian destroyer , Turbine , was severely damaged further south . On the shore , the infrastructure of the port of Ancona , as well as the surrounding towns , were severely damaged .

However , the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south Slavs and , in due course , reallocated the ships . The ship had been boarded by a scratch Yugoslav crew on 10 November 1918 , one day before the Armistice , and had left Pola with her sister ship , Radetzky . They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships , so the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spalato ( also known as Split ) . They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender , which a squadron of United States Navy ( USN ) submarine chasers in the area did . She had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south Slav state , as it was a Croat naval officer , Korvettenkapitän Marijan <unk> , who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the United States Navy on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato ( Split ) in Dalmatia .

The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men — the latter entirely composed of United States Navy Reserve Force personnel .

       " 'As fun as craps can get, to truly enjoy the game and avoid any potential faux pas, it’s important to understand the craps etiquette at the table.\\nIn this guide I will walk you through the do’s and don’ts of craps etiquette.\\nLet’s get started!\\n1. Never Hand Cash to the Dealer\\nIn a game of craps, it’s important to remember that you should never hand cash directly to the dealer.\\nThis isn’t a personal slight, but rather a standard casino rule.\\nIf you want to buy-in, wait for a pause between rolls, place your cash on the table, make eye contact with the dealer, and say, “Change, please.”\\n2. Keep the Dice Visible\\nWhen you’re the shooter (the person rolling the dice), always keep the dice visible. Don’t remove them from the table or hide them from the dealer.\\nThis is to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the game.\\n3. Don’t Buy-in During a Roll\\nNever attempt to buy-in or exchange cash for chips when the shooter has the dice. Wait for the dealer to indicate when it’s okay to place bets and when you should not.\\nIf you’re playing, ensure the dealer confirms any bet you’re trying to place before the shooter rolls the dice.\\n4. Respect the Pace of the Game\\nAs the shooter, you control the pace of the game. When it’s your turn, just shoot the dice. Avoid unnecessary delays, such as blowing on the dice, which can also spread germs.\\nIf you don’t feel like shooting, you can always “pass right” and let the next player take their turn.\\n5. Passing Right\\nIf you don’t want to shoot, it’s perfectly acceptable to pass the dice to the player on your right.\\nTo do this, open your hand with the dice in your palm and indicate them towards the next player in a clockwise manner.\\n6. Hands High\\nWhen the dealer says, “Hands high” or “the dice are out”, lift your hands off the table.\\nThis ensures you’re not interfering with the play and the dice can be passed to the shooter without obstruction.\\n7. Be Respectful to Other Players\\nGood manners are essential at the craps table.\\nAvoid hanging your hands over the edge of the rail or resting drinks on the rail. Excessive drinking can lead to disruptive behavior, so it’s best to drink responsibly.\\nKeep the table clean and free from drinks and cigarette ashes.\\n8. Ask the Dealer for Help\\nIf you’re unsure about the different bets or any aspect of the game, feel free to ask the dealer for help. However, don’t rely on the dealer to coach you throughout the game.\\nThe craps table can get crowded, and dealers need to focus on managing the game.\\n9. Don’t Forget to Tip\\nTipping the dealer is a common courtesy, regardless of whether you win or lose. Never hand a dealer money directly.\\nInstead, place money or chips on the table for tipping purposes and clearly state what the money is for. You can also place a bet for your dealer as a tip.\\nCraps is an exciting and engaging game that brings together people from all walks of life.\\nUnderstanding and practicing proper craps etiquette not only enhances your gaming experience but also contributes to a friendly and respectful atmosphere at the table.\\nRemember, the goal is to have fun and enjoy the game.\\nBy following these craps etiquette guidelines, you’ll be able to participate in the game smoothly, make new friends, and create memorable experiences.\\nSo, whether you’re a seasoned player or a newbie, step up to the craps table with confidence and respect, and let the good times roll!',\n",

       " 'F1: Raikkonen Cruises to Melbourne WinFittingly for the man deemed as Michael Schumacher\\'s successor at Ferrari, Kimi Raikkonen began his Scuderia career in dominating fashion, leading from lights to flag in the Australian Grand Prix season opener at Melbourne\\'s Albert Park circuit.\\nAfter easing his pace near the end, the Finn crossed the finish line 7.2 seconds ahead of reigning double world champion Fernando Alonso. The Spaniard\\'s rookie McLaren teammate, Lewis Hamilton, completed his impressive debut weekend with a podium.\\nHamilton was one of the stars of a race that saw most of the action take place behind the leaders. The Briton, fourth on the grid, jumped to third at the start as Alonso was forced to back off and dropped to P4 while fighting with Nick Heidfeld\\'s BMW for second place.\\nAt the end of trouble-free first lap - Anthony Davidson\\'s Super Aguri seemed to stall at the start, but the former Honda tester was able to continue -Raikkonen already led Heidfeld by 1.2sec, with Hamilton, Alonso, Robert Kubica in the second BMW, Renault\\'s Giancarlo Fisichella, Red Bull\\'s Mark Webber and Toyota\\'s Ralf Schumacher rounding out the top-eight.\\nRaikkonen\\'s teammate Felipe Massa gained four spots at the start, moving up to 18th. The Brazilian had started last, after qualifying 16th due to gearbox problems, then losing 10 grid spots with an engine-change penalty.\\nDespite being on hard tires versus Heidfeld\\'s soft compound - as a novelty in the 2007 regulations, drivers are obligated to use both tire variations during the race - Raikkonen had no trouble in pulling away from the German in a rate of over half a second per lap. By the time Heidfeld kicked off the first round of pitstops for the frontrunners, on lap 14, he trailed Raikkonen by over eight seconds.\\nBefore that, however, Christijan Albers had the dubious honor of being the first driver to retire in the 2007 season, and in a bizarre manner. The Dutch driver missed a braking zone inexplicably, crashing his Spyker against the tire barriers. Afterwards, Albers admitted he got distracted while adjusting the car\\'s radio.\\nMeanwhile Massa\\'s recovery drive came to a halt when he reached the 16th spot and the Hondas of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello. The Briton, with a heavy fuel load, slowed down both Brazilians for eight laps before being overtaken by Barrichello on lap 14 and by Massa two laps later.\\nCatch up on the latest Formula 1 developments each month in RACER. Check out our look at how Kimi Raikkonen settled in at Ferrari over the winter in our April issue, on sale now!\\nRaikkonen pitted early, on the 18th lap, giving Hamilton the opportunity to lead five laps on his maiden race. The rookie came in on the 23rd, one lap after teammate Alonso, and the top-three positions remained unchanged. Heidfeld was the biggest loser in the initial round of stops, dropping to fifth, behind teammate Kubica.\\nMassa, for his part, didn\\'t pit until the 29th of 58 laps, giving away a one-stop strategy to make up for the lost time. Button\\'s miserable weekend continued in the meantime, with the Honda man being awarded a drive-through penalty for pitlane speeding. On the same lap, American Scott Speed, who ran as high as 17th, had to park his Toro Rosso after an off due to tire problems.\\nEight laps later, Kubica\\'s fine run came to an end when he drove his BMW into the garage with gearbox problems, an issue that had plagued the Swiss-German team all through winter testing.\\nAnother top-team newbie wasn\\'t having as much of a stellar run: after a couple of brief offs, Renault\\'s Heikki Kovalainen spun but managed to rejoin on lap 41.\\nAlso spinning on lap 44, when the second round of pit stops was under way, was local favorite Mark Webber, who managed the feat while entering the pits. The Australian lost time, but was able to continue unscathed. Ditto for Raikkonen, whose tranquil run was spiced up by a small off-road excursion on lap 47.\\nThe second round of pits produced the final main change in the order, as Alonso was able to emerge of the boxes ahead of Hamilton to gain P2. From then on, the only piece of headlining action came from a dive-bomb move by Red Bull\\'s David Coulthard on Alex Wurz\\'s Williams on lap 51 in a fight for the 13th spot. The Scot\\'s overly optimistic maneuver on the inside caused both cars to touch wheels, launching DC\\'s RB3, which just barely missed running over Wurz\\'s helmet. Both men retired at the spot.\\nSeven laps later, Raikkonen crossed the finish line for his first win since 2005. Heidfeld rallied to finish fourth, ahead of Fisichella, who fended off a last-gasp attack by Massa, the Brazilian\\'s one-stop strategy paying off with a P6 finish. Williams\\' Nico Rosberg and Ralf Schumacher in the Toyota took the remaining Australian GP points.\\n\"It wasn\\'t as easy as it seemed, but we had a plan and followed it,\" Raikkonen said. \"\" We pushed hard on the opening laps and the car was perfect all day long. It\\'s an excellent start to our season.\"\\nDespite the defeat, Alonso was upbeat with the eight points hauled from Albert Park: \"We need to work harder if we are to win races, but we made the max out of the circumstances,\" the Spaniard felt. \"I had to focus on Heidfeld at the start and left room for Lewis to go, and that cost us. But it was a good fight.\"\\nAn elated Hamilton, the first black driver to achieve the pinnacle of motorsport, celebrated a debut that, a couple of minor offs during the race aside, was nearly impeccable: \"Leading was fantastic, a fantastic feeling really. It was tough to have the champion behind me, but the team did an incredible job getting the car ready in the off-season. I don\\'t know what happened on the second stop, I felt like it was a good stop, but in all it was a great experience.\"\\nThe 2007 Formula 1 season resumes in three weeks\\' time with the Malaysian GP. The teams will arrive at the Kuala Lumpur venue one week before for a series of open tests.\\n2007 Australian Grand Prix results.',\n",
       " 'How to find the right plan to fit your budget\\nIt’s always a good idea to have dental insurance. Maintaining good oral health impacts your body’s overall health, so it’s important to know you can regularly access dental health services that are covered by a good insurance plan.\\nLike any service or product, though, there are many options to choose from in the marketplace and it can be tricky to know which dental benefits plan is best for you. A good place to start is understanding the basics of dental insurance.\\nDetermine your dental care needs\\nThe first consideration is to determine your needs. If you are single and younger in age, the best dental plan for you will differ from that of a married couple with several children.\\nCost of the dental insurance plan you choose will be determined by the type of plan that is chosen. While premiums for dental insurance are generally lower compared to conventional health insurance, dental plans generally cover 80% of costs on basic procedures such as treating cavities, removing teeth, and root canals. More serious procedures such as crowns and treatment of gum disease may only have 50% of costs covered.\\nMost plans do cover 100% of preventative procedures such as teeth cleanings and X-rays.\\nThree Types of Dental Insurance Plans\\n- Indemnity or fee-for-service plans are generally the most expensive type of coverage. They will offer the largest network of dental providers to choose from and insurers will generally put a cap on the costs they’ll cover for certain procedures. Additionally, it’s not uncommon for the patient to pay the entire cost for a procedure and then file a claim with the insurer, which will provide reimbursement upon approval of the claim.\\n- Preferred provider organizations (PPO) are one of the most common types of plans available and feature a network of dentists who negotiate fees with the insurer, resulting in lower out-of-pocket fees for the patient. Patients are able to use a dentist outside of the established network of providers, but there is usually a higher cost.\\n- Health maintenance organizations (HMO) are similar to PPOs in that dentists join a network of providers to provide services at reduced costs. However, in an HMO the networks are usually much smaller within a constrained geographic footprint. In some cases, there may be out-of-network services these plans will allow you to access at a reduced cost. While these are generally the cheapest dental insurance plans available, they are also the most limited.\\nAccessing dental insurance plans\\nMost people have access to dental insurance through their employer, however, insurance can also be secured through group coverage programs that might include the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\\nThe alternative to group coverage plans is purchasing an individual plan, which can be more expensive. These plans can also be more limited in the type of procedures that are covered and there’s sometimes a waiting period of anywhere between a few months to a year before major procedures will be covered.\\nWhen considering an individual dental plan, it may also be worth implementing a Health Savings Account (HSA), which can be used to set aside funds to cover costs of procedures that the plan may not cover.\\nRegardless of the dental insurance plan chosen, it is important to check on whether it is accepted by your dentist. If the plan is an HMO or PPO, it’s also important to determine if the dentist is within the network of those plans.\\nAssociated Dentists is Here to Help\\nIf you need any assistance understanding your dental insurance benefits or would like to inform us of any changes to your coverage, reach out to our in-house insurance department at our Madison and Verona locations.',\n",

       " 'Have you been overindulging during the pandemic? Has the stress of a new school year got you reaching for that extra glass of Rosé or pint of beer? We totally understand how 2020 may have seen an increase in your alcohol consumption. Does your Uber Eats driver see you more than their own family? Zoom calls, bubble busting anti-maskers, neck kinks from looking down at social distancing arrows. This year has been a bitch. And to get through it we have been tipping back a lot of delicious, frothy beverages.\\nSometimes it’s the idea of indulging that settles your brain. Knowing in that first sip you are going to get a hit of hops, a sparkle of citrus, or a burst of barley. You don’t have to miss out on that if you are looking to dial it back this Fall. Beer can still be enjoyed without the warm buzz and fuzzy brain. If you love the actual taste of beer as much as I do I have the perfect substitute; Partake Brewing.\\nPartake is the leading non-alcoholic craft beer brand in Canada. No, this isn’t your big breweries lightened up version of their already incredibly light beer. This is craft to its core. Focused on providing a healthy alternative Partake Brewing doesn’t skimp on flavour either. If you are trying their IPA, they want you to taste an IPA. With five styles there is an option for everyone.\\nStarting with the lightest in the group this ale is perfect for beginners. Lots of bread, grain and slight citrus notes on the palate. Light, crisp and refreshing.\\nWhen I drink a red ale I expect to taste lots of caramel, brown sugar, nuts and dried fruit like figs and prune. This beer doesn’t disappoint. With its clear and copper hue you will quickly forget you are not drinking a full-strength beer.\\nA classic American style, this beer pours deep gold and surprises you with lots of depth in flavour. Resinous, citrusy and floral on the taste buds with a bright finish.\\nIPA drinkers are a fickle bunch. This version will gain many fans. Punchy with bright aromatic and bittering hops like the classic Citra, Cascade and Amarillo you get bursts of orange, honey sweetness and the pithiness of grapefruit all IPA lovers expect to find.\\nDark chocolate, coffee, a little nuttiness and smokiness Partake Stout is a dark beer lover’s dream. Still full-bodied and creamy this is the perfect sipper on a cool summer evening.\\nYou don’t have to give up alcohol to enjoy non-alcoholic choices. Sometimes we just need a break. And having a variety of choices in your fridge for your abstaining friends or those who can’t drink makes you a great hang. Especially with choices like Partake Brewing.',\n",

       " \"It's Time to Get Proactive About Managed IT Services\\nStay ahead of potential disruptions with scalable, reliable IT security technology.\\nArticles published August 4, 2020 by Ben Killion\\nOutdated software, network outages, and data breaches are only a few of the potential tech issues that threaten to dismantle your business’s IT infrastructure and decrease productivity.\\nAn investment in a comprehensive managed IT solution, like Aureon ProCare, helps avoid these and other network disruptions before they happen. Moving to this type of automation-based system can save you time and money.\\nReactive Versus Proactive IT Support Solutions\\nA business that operates with a reactive IT support mindset does not respond to problems until they happen. For instance, if your network goes down and you call someone to come fix it that is reactive care. It may take hours to solve the problem and in the meantime, you’re losing money.\\nA business that operates with a proactive IT support mindset invests in 24/7 network monitoring and automated services that ensure IT systems stay patched, updated, and secure. The focus is on detecting and defending against security threats for PCs and network issues before they happen.\\nWhat Should You Look for in a solution like ProCare?\\nWhile all businesses can benefit from proactive monitoring and maintenance, identifying the maturity level of your IT infrastructure may help determine what kind of support you need.\\nCommon features for this type of solution that provide benefits for any size organization include:\\n- Network monitoring and proactive maintenance of key network points\\n- Automated patching to keep your systems current\\n- Responsive remote and onsite IT support options\\n- Secure data backup and disaster recovery\\n- Comprehensive network security solutions\\nAureon ProCare combines 24/7 network monitoring and maintenance with innovative backup and security technologies to monitor your IT infrastructure and designated devices. The scalable service options allow you to select the level of cybersecurity support your organization needs.\\nHow Can ProCare Benefit Your Business?\\nAn investment in ProCare-type technology provides several direct and indirect benefits that will increase IT system efficiencies and boost your bottom line. Here are a few highlights.\\n1. Enhanced Security\\nNetwork security should be top of mind for any business, regardless of industry. Proactive IT support typically involves the deployment of antivirus protection and data encryption technology. Network security solutions may include firewall management, content filtering, and intrusion protection. Secure cloud backup and disaster recovery offer advanced protection.\\n2. Increased Productivity\\nModern businesses rely on technology to stay competitive. Most of your employees cannot even perform their jobs without a stable network connection. If your network goes down unexpectedly, a remote or onsite team who is already familiar with your IT infrastructure will work to quickly find a solution. Less downtime ensures that employees can get back to work and stay productive.\\n3. Better Planning\\nBecause your network is being monitored and maintained around-the-clock, there is less of a chance for unexpected IT expenses to occur that can easily derail your annual budget. Reporting options on technology performance provide accurate records of where your IT infrastructure stands. They will also help you plan your IT budget for the next fiscal year to achieve your goals.\\nDon’t Get Caught Off Guard\\nMaking the switch to a proactive IT support system sounds simple enough, but it can be difficult without access to a dedicated team that has the time and resources to work and think ahead.\\nYou can pair Aureon ProCare with our other managed IT services to obtain the level of support your business needs, whether you have a small business with limited to no IT resources or a large business with an in-house IT department that needs help tackling complex problems.\\nThere’s no time like the present to get proactive and stay ahead of the competition.\\nHave you been taking a proactive or reactive approach to network security? Are you ready to invest in a more secure solution?\",\n",

       " 'Facebook is “shedding more light” on the mysterious world of online advertising with its new ‘off-facebook’ feature, but the company is already warning advertisers it will impact targeting.\\nThe company’s chief privacy officer policy Erin Egan and director of product management David Baser announced the launch of the new function overnight, which is set to begin being rolled out globally.\\n“Many apps and websites are free because they’re supported by online advertising. And to reach people who are more likely to care about what they are selling, businesses often share data about people’s interactions on their websites with ad platforms and other services,” the Facebook executives said.\\n“To help shed more light on these practices that are common yet not always well understood, today we’re introducing a new way to view and control your off-Facebook activity.”\\nThe feature allows users to see and control the data that other apps and websites share with Facebook, which is gathered across the internet through the ‘Login with Facebook’ function, ‘Likes’ and embedded Facebook pixel code that hides in the background of certain websites and collects audience data.\\nWith Off-Facebook, users can see a summary of all the data apps and websites have sent about them to Facebook, disconnect this information and choose to disconnect all data with the clear off-Facebook activity function.\\nUsers can also tailor which apps and websites share their activity with Facebook.\\nThe introduction of the new tool is on-brand with Facebook’s post-Cambridge Analytica privacy push and was actually first announced at last year’s Facebook developer conference, which took place just weeks after the scandal broke.\\nIt was originally set to be a ‘Clear History’ feature (which it still is), however, Facebook opted to add in additional functions.\\nBy providing more transparency to the workings of online advertising and giving users the option to opt-out of certain data collection, Facebook certainly risks hurting its profitability with the latest move.\\nAhead of the announcement, Facebook issued a statement to advertisers, telling them point-blank “this feature may affect targeting”.\\n“When someone disconnects their off-Facebook activity, we won’t use the data they clear for targeting. This means that targeting options powered by Facebook’s business tools, such as the Facebook pixel, can’t be used to reach someone with ads,” Facebook said.\\nWhether this will scare off advertisers is yet to be seen, but with Facebook COO telling the media earlier this year “our bottom line is getting [Off-Facebook] right”, it could be argued the company is now prioritising privacy over profitability.\\nOff-Facebook is initially being rolled out in Ireland, South Korea and Spain, but will expand globally in the coming months.\\nDomain’s chief marketing officer (CMO), Rebecca Darley, said that without Tealium’s customer data platform (CDP), her business would not have been able to achieve the personalised marketing success that has made it one of the leaders in data-driven marketing in Australia.

       " 'Report: APTs Adopting New Phishing Methods to Drop PayloadHackers Using Rich Text Format Template Injection to Bypass Anti-Malware\\nMultiple APT groups from Russia, China, and India are adopting a new phishing attack technique, using Rich Text Format, or RTF, template injection, which makes their attacks harder to detect and stop, researchers warn.\\nRTF template injection is a technique in which an RTF file containing decoy content can be altered to allow for the retrieval of content hosted at an external URL upon opening an RTF file. The template is compatible with Microsoft Office, which makes it easier for a user to open or edit these documents, giving attackers an opportunity to attack any system.\\nProofpoint researchers first observed the increasing adoption of RTF template injection from February 2021 through April 2021, but the researchers say this technique was first seen as early as January 2021.\\nThe Proofpoint threat researchers assess with moderate confidence that this novel technique could be adopted by other financially motivated cybercriminals.\\n\"This technique, referred to as RTF template injection, leverages the legitimate RTF template functionality. It subverts the plain text document formatting properties of an RTF file and allows the retrieval of a URL resource instead of a file resource via an RTF’s template control word capability,\" says Michael Raggi, senior threat research engineer at Proofpoint.\\nThe process enables an adversary to replace a file destination with a URL from which a remote payload may be retrieved. In the next stage, the retrieved payload can be loaded into an application or steal Windows credentials. The researchers say that since the payload is not in the document but in a shared URL, an antivirus will scan the RTF file and mark it safe, even though the URL is malicious.\\nThe researchers say that a malicious payload can be retrieved using .doc.rtf file, which is an extension that specifies an RTF file will be opened with Microsoft Word.\\n\"When an RTF Remote Template Injection file is opened using Microsoft Word, the application will retrieve the resource from the specified URL before proceeding to display the lure content of the file. This technique is successful despite the inserted URL not being a valid document template file,\" Raggi says.\\nResearchers demonstrated a process in which the RTF file was weaponized to retrieve the documentation page for RTF version from a URL at the time the file is opened.\\n\"The technique is also valid in the .rtf file extension format, however a message is displayed when opened in Word which indicates that the content of the specified URL is being downloaded and in some instances an error message is displayed in which the application specifies that an invalid document template was utilized prior to then displaying the lure content within the file,\" Raggi says.\\nThe weaponization part of the RTF file is made possible by creating or altering an existing RTF file’s document property bytes using a hex editor, which is a computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data.\\n\"This technique does not require the use of a word processor application for the injection of the RTF remote template URL into the file,\" the researchers say.\\n“Nation-state groups tend to innovate first with new attack vector variations and this would seem to be the case in this example,\" says Jason Steer, principal security strategist at threat intelligence company Recorded Future. He says the attack vectors have a short shelf life, which makes it difficult for the infosec community to learn about them.\\nSteer also says other problems exists: Not enough vendors can work and play together well and the security industry is terrible at sharing intelligence, which he says is the best way to enable security tools to be more effective at identifying these risks as they emerge.\\nTimeline of RTF Template Adoption\\nThe researchers identified two distinct APT groups associated with the state interests of India and China that adopted RTF template injection earlier this year. Russian use of the technique has also been observed.\\nProofpoint researchers attribute these template injection RTF files to the APT group DoNot Team, which is suspected of being aligned with Indian-state interests, identified through July 8, 2021. The researchers also identified a Chinese-related APT actor likely using RTF files to target entities with ties to Malaysian deep water energy exploration as recently as Sept. 29, 2021 (see: Chinese APT Group Reportedly Develops Custom Backdoor).\\n\"Following this initial adoption period, the APT actor Gamaredon, which has been linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) was later observed utilizing RTF template injection files in campaigns that leveraged Ukrainian governmental file lures on Oct. 5, 2021,\" the researchers say.\\nIn June 2021, Check Point researchers uncovered an ongoing campaign by a Chinese advanced persistent threat group that had spent the last three years testing and refining a custom backdoor in its arsenal to conduct espionage campaigns targeting governments in Southeast Asia.\\nDuring the investigation, researchers found that the campaign starts with a spear-phishing email containing malicious DOCX documents, which is sent to different employees of a government entity in Southeast Asia.\\nThe document delivers an RTF file that is weaponized with what Check Point calls the RoyalRoad exploit builder, which takes advantage of users who have failed to patch older vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word’s Equation Editor.\\nExpect RTF Use to Continue\\n\"We would expect to see this sophisticated attack appearing more widely in 2022 as the technique trickles down to cybercriminals and, as phishing will still be the main attack vector, the importance of regular and up-to-date anti-phishing awareness and simulation training becomes ever more important,\" says Alan Calder of GRC International Group, a provider of IT governance, risk management and compliance solutions.\\n\"The moral of the story is that adversaries will continue to evolve or modify their tactics and that your anti-malware solution will ultimately fall short of providing confidence that at any given moment a user, asset or workload has not been compromised,\" says Tim Wade, technical director, CTO team at cybersecurity company Vectra AI.\\n\"Managing this inevitable compromise with visibility, detection and response is the hallmark of modern enterprise security programs resilient to motivated adversaries, and their legacy peers that continue to struggle with the disruption of a successful attack,\" Wade says.\\n\"Weaponized documents that require enabling downloads or other connections to external content aren\\'t new. In this case, the methods used by attackers are novel because they can hide malicious URLs through the use of Rich Text Format\\'s capabilities, either by embedding raw text or through the use of Unicode and other means,\" says Sean Nikkel, senior cyberthreat intel analyst at digital risk protection solutions provider Digital Shadows.\\nNikkel says users should be wary of opening documents that require downloads of templates or other data from the internet, especially from unknown users. Organizations may want to restrict file types such as RTF, strip inbound emails of attachments, or use a sandbox to test them for malicious activity.',\n",

Presto - Andante amabile e con moto - Tempo l\\nВремя создания: апрель-июнь 1824 года.\\nAnatol Ugorski, фортепиано\\nThe summer of 1822 proved to be extremely difficult for Beethoven financially. The costs for the upkeep of his nephew and servants as well as his household were high. His health was bad, so doctors\\' costs and a forthcoming stay in a spa consumed additional amounts of money. On top of this he had old debts with the publisher Steiner, who now demanded their repayment including interest. Beethoven had also incurred debts with his friend Franz Brentano in Frankfurt, as he had paid him an advance for acting as an agent for the Missa solemnis (which was neither finished nor even sold), as well as with the publisher Artaria in Vienna. In desperation the composer turned to his brother Johann. Johann van Beethoven, the family?s \"financial genius\" who was wealthy and very skilled in business matters, came to Ludwig\\'s aid. He gave him cash and obviously stood security for him with Steiner, so that in the end Beethoven owed Johann 500 florins. But Johann van Beethoven was not wealthy because he was a sentimental businessman. And he knew his brother and his promises. Unlike publishers and friends he did not heed Ludwig\\'s assurances but instead demanded copyright for several of his works, including the Bagatelles which Beethoven wanted to sell to the publisher Peters and which were later to become op. 119. As a result the unavoidable occurred: the brothers argued and had it out through different publishers. Johann tried to sell the Bagatelles, Ludwig tried to prevent this as he thought his brother was cheating him. Schemes and plots abounded, supposed intrigues were uncovered and hatched anew. Ludwig won: via his former pupil Ferdinand Ries, who lived in London, he sold the Bagatelles op. 119 to an English publisher. Once published they no longer had any business value for Johann. He did not, however, give up. To compensate Johann for the lost money, Ludwig had to provide a replacement. As he did not have any money, he provided compensation in the form of a new cycle of six Bagatelles op. 126, which he composed in spring 1824. On 19 June 1824 he told his brother that they were ready for collection.\\nThis is the last and probably finest of the three sets of Bagatelles Beethoven wrote. In general, the six works comprising the collection are not as light as those in the earlier sets and the three lone Bagatelles without opus numbers. That said, the opening piece in Op. 126 is decidedly pleasant and light. Marked Andante con moto, it is a mostly serene work whose joyous main theme exudes a sense of self-confidence. Textures lighten in the latter part of the work, as the music takes on an almost angelic glow, heralding the incandescent close of the composer\\'s last piano sonata. The Bagatelle No. 2 in G minor contrasts with the opening work in both its livelier Allegro tempo and somewhat anxious mood. Still, the ambivalent main theme here never tilts toward the dark side in its mixture of the stormy and playful, of the anxious and the delicate. The Bagatelle No. 3 in E flat major, marked Andante, is tranquil in its serenity and grandeur, its theme noble and clearly looking toward the nascent Romantic movement. Does this work augur the mood, perhaps even the keyboard writing, in the middle movement of Brahms\\' Piano Concerto No. 1? The Bagatelle No. 4 in B minor is a Presto filled with angst in its driving rhythms and heroic, stormy main theme. An alternate melody in the upper register, also lively and energetic, exhibits a measure of calm and gracefulness, and on its second appearance closes out this anxious piece in a relatively subdued mood. The G major No. 5, marked Quasi Allegretto, provides stark contrast to the preceding Bagatelle in its serene, dreamy, and consistently gentle manner. While it offers few technical challenges to the pianist, it will present sufficient interpretive ones. The concluding Bagatelle in E flat major is marked Presto -- Andante amabile e con moto, and begins with a surge of swirling currents that quickly turn tame for the introduction of the dreamy main theme. The music gradually becomes more animated, prodded by elements from the opening, and the theme exhibits a deeper expressive manner in its mixture of heroism and serenity. The opening surge mischievously returns to close out this masterpiece.\\n(Robert Cummings, Rovi)',\n",

       " 'Panorama Bar 03\\nCompiled and mixed by Prosumer whose own productions worship the big old lady that is house music time and time again, the 12-Inch sampler for “Panorama Bar 03” could have hardly been better. Hitherto unreleased, the tree tracks on Ostgut Ton 47 tick all the boxes that make Prosumer such a unique DJ: house in its various identities. Soundstore starts the triptych with “Take U”. Greatness and frantic fever visions go hand in hand while hitting the core of Chicago’s second wave: Dance Mania, Cajual, and Relief with siren-like hooks in a feverish delirium. Irresistible. Prosumer’s Panorama Bar fellow Steffi slows down the pace. “Sadness” that surprisingly did not make it on her album debut is not only the opener of the actual Panorama Bar mix, but also a tribute to that kind of “deep house” that doesn’t take its prefix lightly. In the end, Berlin’s Hunee teaches you a freestyle lesson. In a similar way to the young Pal Joey, he feeds his sampler a well-known dish, but throws in peculiarity, rascality and deviation to get new results.

       " 'Bras for Every Body Type: How Online Shopping Can Help You Find the Right Fit\\nOnline shopping has revolutionized the way we shop for bras. Gone are the days when bras were just one-size-fits-all and shopping for the right bra was a nightmare task. Now, with the dawn of online shopping, finding a fitting bra for your body type is more convenient and hassle-free than ever before.\\nBut how does one determine the right type of bras for their body type? Of course, the first step is to ask yourself question: Am I a plus size, petite, full-figured, or small-breasted woman? And once you’ve established which category you fall into, then you can move onto the next step – shopping for bras!\\nThere are bras for every body type from petite to plus size, full-figured to small-breasted. When it comes to online shopping, the options are even better. Online stores offer larger range of sizes than traditional stores. They also carry a more diverse selection of styles and fits and can also help you find the best bras for your body type and give you advice on which fits and fabrics are best for you.\\nOnline shopping makes it easy to try on bras without a lot of embarrassment or hassle. You can take your time and go through different styles and sizes to find the one that fits you perfectly. Most sites offer free shipping and returns, so you won’t be stuck with a bra that doesn’t fit. Plus, you can take advantage of online discounts and coupons to get even better deals.\\nWhen it comes to full-figured women, fitting a bra properly is especially important. The wrong fit can lead to spillage and discomfort due to straps or not enough support. Going for full-figured bras that feature unique details like wider straps and more structured frames can help provide a great fit and support. Leading retailers make sure to provide bras for full-figured women that flatter their curves while providing the support they need.\\nFor small-breasted women, bras with lightweight fabrics that offer minimal support are best. These bras provide just enough coverage without being bulky. They also look great under clothes and won’t make the wearer feel under-supported or uncomfortable. Going for lighter fabrics with delicate details and light padding can help make bigger breasts appear smaller, while adjustable straps can help customize the fit.\\nPlus size women have unique needs when it comes to finding the right bra fit. Going for styles that offer firm support and are designed to keep your chest secure and comfortable are must. Plus size bras are usually more structured in order to ensure the bra’s framework provides the necessary support.\\nFull-figured and plus-sized women have the additional advantage of finding bras that are designed with lacy details, unique colors, or sexy satin styles that provide a sense of glamour and confidence-boosting effect.\\nWhen it comes to petite women, finding bras that fit is equally as important. But, petite bras usually feature thinner straps, less padding, and a shallow neckline in comparison to other sizes. Hosiery and lightweight fabrics are commonly used for a comfortable and snug fit. Petite bras also come in various colors and patterns that are designed to fit smaller frames without sacrificing style.\\nShopping for bras can be a complicated and daunting endeavor, but with the help of online shopping, you can find the perfect bras for your body type. Take advantage of the comprehensive selection and information that online stores offer to ensure you get the best fit.',\n",
       " 'How Do Male Enhancement Pills Work?\\nPenis size is without a doubt one of the most important things to men when it comes to their confidence. Simply put, guys that have bigger penises carry around more confidence, knowing that they can satisfy almost every woman in the bedroom. There is nothing more embarassing to a guy if he can’t get it up, keep it up, or last more than 3 minutes when in the sack.\\nLike alot of guys, you may be interested in taking a male enhancement supplement to help with your problem, but your skeptical because you are unsure of whether or not it works. We decided to give you a quick overview of what male enhancement pills are TRULY designed to do, as well as give you our brief synopsis of the best performing ones on the market.\\nSo How Exactly Do Penis Pills Work?\\nWell, its quite simple. The penis contains a number of blood vessels and arteries that fill with blood when you are sexually aroused. See diagram below:\\nPenis enlargment pills, when taken as a daily supplement, increase the amount of blood flow whenever you have an erection. Over time, as more and more blood flows to the penis, the muscle called the corpora cavernosa (CP muscle for short), gradually expands and allows more blood to flow into the penis.\\nIt does this by relaxing the tissues around those muscles we talked about earlier, quickly filling the blood chambers and allowing for a sustained erection. Simply put, the more blood flowing to the penis results in fuller, longer lasting erections, a heightened sexual desire, and a more sensitive feeling during sex.\\nAchieving Your Optimum Size\\nIt has been said that 40 million american men suffer from some sort of erectile dysfunction. The ability to achieve a natural erection is BY FAR more effective and safe than using pharmaceutical drugs that come with harmful side effects and unneccesary prolonged erections.\\nHelping yourself get rid of your ED problem will increase your confidence, sex drive, and the ability to satisfy your partner like never before. Using male enhancement pills takes time to work, but you will get the satisfaction of having an erection ON DEMAND without feeling embarrassed about your sexual competency.\\nLeave Your Review of How Do Male Enhancement Pills Work?

       " 'Healing is an often neglected part of Fortnite strategy. In the rush to load up on the best gear possible while looting, players often settle for a full shield and one healing item to fall back on. However, healing in Fortnite Season 9 is just as important as any other aspect. Great aim and fast building will help you, but you’ve got to be able to recover from mistakes. This guide will run you through which healing items you should be going for and how to use your healing in more creative ways.\\nHealing doesn’t have to just be for getting yourself out of a bad situation. Healing can actively form a part of your strategy, with the right healing set up and some good timing, you can actually use it to allow you to play more recklessly. Pro players often heal up multiple times per game, the confidence of having a fall-back helps them make bigger plays.\\nMost players just focus on getting a full shield at the beginning of the game. This is your first healing concern. Following that, you need one of your inventory slots to be taken up by something to use to heal. You won’t typically need to carry more than this since eliminations should give you healing items or add some health on via the siphon. However, if you do keep an extra slot open, you can exploit the late game storms using healing items to stay ahead of the curve.\\nHealing Your Shield\\nShields are vital for staying alive during interactions with other players. Your options for getting a full shield are limited to:\\n- Small Shield –These drop in stacks of three. Each takes only two seconds to drink and gives you 25 shield. These can’t be used to raise your shield above 50.\\n- Large Shield –Drop in stacks of one and take five seconds to drink. Each gives you 50 shield.\\n- Chug Jug –This is a huge healing item that takes the whole of fifteen seconds to consume These are pretty hard to find but will heal your health and shield fully.\\n- Slurp Juice –This heals you up to a full shield if necessary. It grants one extra shield every 0.5 seconds up to 75 if you have the space for it.\\n- Chug Splash –This is a new item added to the game that gives you 25 shield per splash. It is used almost instantly by throwing it like a grenade.\\nOnce you’ve acquired your full shield, an item like a slurp juice or chug jug can really help you out later in the game. Don’t bother with small shields after the opening of a game. Large shields aren’t even particularly viable when there are better items out there. Chug Splashes can also be really helpful when you need to heal in a hurry. Since they can stack in 6s, a pile of these is going to be the best healing option if it is a little hard to find.\\nIf you can find a Slurp Juice or Chug Jug, these are the better choices. Most players will carry some shields, so if you have to prioritise then you should avoid carrying standard shield potions over a med kit.\\nAs well as your shield potions, you need equipment to heal your HP. Your options are a bit more limited for HP. However, many of the better choices overlap with shield healing.\\n- Bandages – The most common healing item and also kind of useless. It heals you by 15 HP up to 75 HP, it takes 3.5 seconds to use and can stack up to 15. It is quick and efficient, but without healing you up all the way it is less than ideal.\\n- Medkit –Slightly less common than the bandages but a lot more useful. This heals your health to 100 no matter how damaged you are. It takes 10 seconds to work and you can carry up to a stack of 3.\\n- Cosy Campfire –This is an item you can place on the ground to heal when you’re stood by it. It heals you for up to 50 HP, adding 2 points every second. It can run for up to 25 seconds and be carried in a stack of any size.\\n- Chug Splash – This item will give you 25 HP points per splash. It works the same as healing your shield just for HP.\\n- Slurp Juice –This also works the same as when used for the shield.\\nWhat Healing Items Should You Loot?\\nWhen choosing which HP items to go for, there’s a clear winner. Of course, the Medkit is the most useful healing item. However, it can be impractical. The Slurp Juice can provide incremental healing that is invaluable in late-game situations, but a Medkit can get you out of nearly every bad situation. If you’re carrying an HP item to rely on, go for the Medkit if you can find one.\\nThe cosy Campfire is really useful for team games. If you’re playing as a Squad or Duo, it is important that one of your team finds one of these to heal everyone up later in the game. The Chug Splash is also effective here. If you manage to find enough Chug Splashes, they are a great way to heal shield or HP for a team or Solo player.\\nHealing in The Storm\\nHealing helps you out when an encounter goes wrong but it also can be used to ride out the storm. Most players with a decent skill level probably don’t care about the storm anymore. They can easily outrun it and rarely pay much attention to it. However, with the right healing items, you can sustain yourself in the storm, which can be an effective tactic when you’re in the end game of a Fortnite match.\\nUsing Medkits with the right timing when combined with a Slurp Juice or a Cosy Campfire can allow you to stay alive in the storm for quite a bit longer than you should be able to. In a close game, this strategy could let you clinch first place when the storm finishes off the Island. If you’re grinding for Hype points, keeping yourself alive in the storm can make all the difference.\\nHealing in Fortnite isn’t too complicated but players who neglect it will lose matches that they could have won. Carrying the right healing items is important for staying alive in Fortnite. However, so is aiming properly and actually getting some kills. Once you’ve stocked up on the right healing items, you also need to make sure you’re running the best settings to get the highest frames per second in Fortnite.',\n",
       " 'Heated Mattress Pads: The Benefits, How They Work, And More\\nAfter a long day, there is nothing better than crawling into a warm bed. But what if your bed was always warm? A heated mattress pad can give you the extra warmth you need to get a good night’s sleep.\\nWhat are the benefits of using a heated mattress pad\\nIf you’re like most people, you spend about one-third of your life asleep. So it’s important to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible when you hit the hay. Otherwise, you might find yourself tossing and turning all night long.\\nOne way to ensure a good night’s sleep is to invest in a heated mattress pad. Here are four benefits of using one:\\n1. They can help relieve pain.\\nIf you suffer from muscle aches or arthritis, a heated mattress pad can help soothe your pains and allow you to get a restful night’s sleep. The heat can also help increase blood flow to the affected areas, which can speed up the healing process.\\n2. They can improve circulation.\\nPoor circulation can lead to a number of health problems, including cold feet and hands, numbness, and swelling. A heated mattress pad can help improve circulation by dilating blood vessels and expanding capillaries. This, in turn, can reduce the risk of those problems.\\n3. They can ease respiratory problems.\\nIf you have asthma or allergies, a heated mattress pad can help clear your nasal passages and ease your breathing. The heat can also help relieve congestion by thinning out mucus.\\n4. They can boost your immune system.\\nThe heat produced by a heated mattress pad can help kill bacteria and viruses, which means it can actually help you fight off illnesses. In fact, one study found that using a heating pad increased white blood cell production in people with arthritis.\\nHow does a heated mattress pad work\\nA heated mattress pad is a bedding accessory that can be placed on top of a mattress to provide warmth. Most heated mattress pads have multiple heat settings so that users can find the perfect level of warmth for their needs. Some even come with timers so that the heating element will automatically turn off after a certain amount of time, helping to prevent accidental fires.\\nWhat are the different settings on a heated mattress pad\\nThere are many different settings on a heated mattress pad. The most common settings are low, medium, and high. Low is typically used for sleeping, as it will not cause you to sweat. Medium is usually used for people who have aches and pains, as it can help to relieve them. High is typically used for people who are cold, as it will raise your body temperature.\\nIs a heated mattress pad safe to use\\nA heated mattress pad is a great way to stay warm and comfortable during the colder months. However, there are a few safety concerns that you should be aware of before using one.\\nHeated mattress pads can pose a fire risk if they are not used properly. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully and never leave the pad unattended while it is on. Also, be sure to place the pad on a fire-resistant surface such as a sheet of plywood.\\nIf you have any medical conditions that affect your circulation or temperature sensitivity, you should check with your doctor before using a heated mattress pad. Otherwise, enjoy the extra warmth and comfort!\\nHow long does it take for a heated mattress pad to heat up\\nMost heated mattress pads will heat up within ten minutes or less. Some models may have a preheat feature that will allow you to warm up the bed before you get in it. It is important to read the manufacturer’s instructions before using this feature, as some models require that you turn off the preheat function once the bed is warmed up, while others will automatically turn off after a set amount of time.\\nHow much does a heated mattress pad cost\\nIf you’re looking for a way to keep your bed warm and cozy all winter long, a heated mattress pad is a great option.

       " 'The medieval enchantment of Crystal Ball is brought to life using clear no-nonsense graphics and well sized symbols. The base game has a simple set up with the action taking place in the dark and murky wooded area outside the wizard’s mansion. In the free games, the game is given an orange background glow and the sound effects intensify, to add to the suspense and enjoyment of the free game play.\\nThe game’s theme also extends to the symbols on the reels. There are four higher value theme related symbols including the wizard, a bottled magic green potion, a unicorn and a chain pendant holding a blue gem. The lower value symbols are represented by the royals A, J, K, Q and 10. The crystal ball itself acts as a wild and scatter symbol, which is where the slot takes its name from.\\nIn addition to being the wild symbol, the crystal ball can also act as a scatter symbol and it provides the opportunity to win 10 free games. The crystal ball will award a scatter payment when at least three of them land anywhere on the reels. When this occurs ten free games are activated. Once the free game bonus is triggered a bonus symbol is automatically selected before the free games can commence. The bonus symbol can be any symbol except the crystal ball. The free games continue with the same playing concept; however, if the bonus symbol lands on any two or more reels, a payline win is awarded even if the symbols are not adjacent to one another along a payline.\\nUpon landing a win, players have the choice of two gamble features that can be used to try to increase the winnings. These options will automatically appear below the reels on the right-hand side of the display screen. The two options are the ‘Ladder Gamble’ and the ‘Card Gamble’.\\nThe Ladder gamble option is accessed by pressing the button with the ladder symbol. Each upward step of the ladder represents a higher value win. Players have the chance to work their way up each rung of the ladder and increase the winnings as they go. However, if the gamble is unsuccessful it can lead to a partial or total loss of the initial win. The ladder gamble will highlight the value of the potential win or loss during each particular turn. There is also an option after the base game win, and each successful gamble thereafter, to collect half of the gamble win and continue to gamble with the remaining amount, which is perfect for those who want to reduce the risk.\\nThe card gamble is entered via the button with the card symbol. Again, you have the chance to increase your win only this time the gamble is placed on guessing the colour of the face down card at the top of the pack. After picking a colour, the top card is revealed and if players have chosen correctly then the payout is doubled. Selecting the wrong colour results in the gamble being fully lost. Similar to the Ladder gamble, there is an option to collect half of the win or gamble win and then continue to gamble with the remainder.\\nCrystal Ball slot is a high volatility game and it has an RTP of 96.12%, which is slightly above average for online slots. Low volatility slots pay out small amounts regularly, whereas high volatility slots pay out large amounts less frequently. As such, players may have to play several spins of this slot before they see a return.\\nThe slot has a top standard payout of 1000x that is won by landing five wizards along a payline. The unicorn can payout up too 400x, the green bottled potion and blue gem pendant payout up too 150x while the royals payout between 20x and 30x. Of course, with the aid of the gamble feature, it is possible to win far more than this from a single spin.\\nHow to Play\\nCrystal Ball is an easy to play slot. Before spinning the reels, all the player needs to do is set his/her total bet per spin using the buttons beneath the reels. The total bet should be divided by 20 to calculate the individual payline bet. All the player then needs to do is click on the spin button. There is also auto play functionality that can be used to set up to 100 spins in motion complete with win and loss limits.',\n",

Although flavor trends can vary markedly by region, research data from Innova indicates that rising interest in superfruits is evident globally, with pomegranate still leading the field. It accounted for more than 40 percent of tracked beverage launches featuring superfruit flavors from June 2008 to May 2013, ahead of açai and lychee with 12.5 percent and 12 percent, respectively, according to Innova data. Emerging or new-generation superfruits are led by guanabana/soursop, cactus/prickly pear and marula.\\n“Cactus/prickly pear is one of the emerging superfruit flavors in the North American beverage market,” said Lu Ann Williams, head of research for Innova Market Insights, in a statement. “U.S. launches over the past year [included] Cactus Juice and Cactus Tea from Nopal and Prickly Pear Cactus Tea from Hunter & Hilsberg as well as Martinelli’s Prickly Passion Lemonade juice drink featuring prickly pear puree.”\\nVegetable flavors also are featured strongly, often in combination with fruit flavors, in juices, smoothies and teas, adding health-giving phytochemicals as well as a new flavor element, Williams added. The number of beverage launches featuring celery increased six-fold in 2012, and those featuring cucumber and beets doubled. Kale also started to be featured in the beverage market in 2012, according to Innova data.\\nThe generally rising level of interest in hot and spicy flavors in the U.S. food market also has spread through to beverages. This has led to the emergence of hot and spicy variants featuring ingredients such as black pepper and chilies, including habanero, jalapeño and chipotle, Innova reports.\\nInnova Market Insights will report on the latest non-alcohol beverage trends and emerging flavors at its Taste the Trend Pavilion (booth No. 1576) at this year’s IFT Food Expo, July 14-16, in Chicago.

       " '21st Century King James Version\\n11 Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.\\n2 (It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)\\n3 Therefore his sisters sent unto Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.”\\n4 When Jesus heard that, He said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.”\\n5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.\\n6 When He heard therefore that Lazarus was sick, He stayed two days still in the same place where He was.\\n7 Then after that He said to His disciples, “Let us go into Judea again.”\\n8 His disciples said unto Him, “Master, the Jews of late sought to stone Thee, and goest Thou thither again?”\\n9 Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.\\n10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth because there is no light in him.”\\n11 These things said He, and after that He said unto them, “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awaken him out of sleep.”\\n12 Then said His disciples, “Lord, if he sleep he shall do well.”\\n13 However Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of the taking of rest in sleep.\\n14 Then Jesus said unto them plainly, “Lazarus is dead.\\n15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent that ye may believe. Nevertheless let us go unto him.”\\n16 Then Thomas, who was called Didymus, said unto his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with Him.”\\n17 Then when Jesus came, He found that he had lain in the grave four days already.\\n18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about two miles away,\\n19 and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.\\n20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him; but Mary sat still in the house.\\n21 Then Martha said unto Jesus, “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.\\n22 But I know that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.”\\n23 Jesus said unto her, “Thy brother shall rise again.”\\n24 Martha said unto Him, “I know that he shall rise again at the resurrection on the Last Day.”\\n25 Jesus said unto her, “I am the resurrection and the Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;\\n26 and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?”\\n27 She said unto Him, “Yea, Lord, I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.”\\n28 And when she had so said, she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, “The Master has come, and calleth for thee.”\\n29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came unto Him.\\n30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.\\n31 The Jews then, who were with her in the house and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, “She goeth unto the grave to weep there.”\\n32 Then when Mary had come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, “Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.”\\n33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,\\n34 and said, “Where have ye laid him?” They said unto Him, “Lord, come and see.”\\n35 Jesus wept.\\n36 Then said the Jews, “Behold, how he loved him!”\\n37 And some of them said, “Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”\\n38 Jesus therefore again, groaning in Himself, came to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.\\n39 Jesus said, “Take ye away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto Him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he hath been dead four days.”\\n40 Jesus said unto her, “Said I not unto thee that if thou would believe, thou should see the glory of God?”\\n41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.\\n42 And I knew that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.”\\n43 And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth!”\\n44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto them, “Loose him, and let him go.”\\n45 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed in Him.\\n46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.\\n47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council and said, “What shall we do? For this man doeth many miracles.\\n48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe in him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.”\\n49 And one of them named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, “Ye know nothing at all,\\n50 nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.”\\n51 And he spoke this not of himself, but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;\\n52 and not for that nation only, but that also He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.\\n53 So from that day forth, they took counsel together to put Him to death.\\n54 Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went thence unto a region near the wilderness into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with His disciples.\\n55 And the Jews’ Passover was nigh at hand, and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves.\\n56 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, saying, “What think ye — that he will not come to the feast?”\\n57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if any man knew where He was, he should report it, that they might take Him.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps the most spectacular of all Greek vases, the Sarpedon krater depicts the body of Sarpedon, a hero of the Trojan War, being carried away to his homeland for burial. It was decorated some 2,500 years ago by Athenian artist Euphronios, and its subsequent history involves tomb raiding, intrigue, duplicity, litigation, international outrage, and possibly even homicide. How this came about is told by Nigel Spivey in a concise, stylish book that braids together the creation and adventures of this extraordinary object with an exploration of its abiding influence.\\nSpivey takes the reader on a dramatic journey, beginning with the krater’s looting from an Etruscan tomb in 1971 and its acquisition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, followed by a high-profile lawsuit over its status and its eventual return to Italy. He explains where, how, and why the vase was produced, retrieving what we know about the life and legend of Sarpedon. Spivey also pursues the figural motif of the slain Sarpedon portrayed on the vase and traces how this motif became a standard way of representing the dead and dying in Western art, especially during the Renaissance.\\nFascinating and informative, The Sarpedon Krater is a multifaceted introduction to the enduring influence of Greek art on the world.',\n",
       " 'Milling around the Monster Stage at the start of Slam Dunk 2015, the crowd enjoys a sudden burst of glaring sunshine, after cloudy skies have threatened rain all morning. It’s clear that this is a festival with its own unique feel – there’s a real sense of family at Slam Dunk. The genres vary, and not everyone will agree on the acts performing here today, but there’s a level of respect among the bands.\\nFirst up is The Colour Morale. It could’ve been the Desperados samples quickly necked to make the set, but three songs in I’m so impressed I order a t-shirt from their merch site there and then. This band should be more than an opening act – energy, showmanship and talent on display from start to finish.\\nNext on the radar are Beartooth, hugely hyped. The crowd expect big things. Unfortunately Beartooth don’t deliver. Maybe it’s all the talk, but the American metalcore outfit live lack the raw emotion and energy found on their record. A disappointment – but the next act can’t possibly disappoint.\\nMarachi El Bronx are something a bit different to break up the day: a fun band, a great crowd, smiles all round and a brilliant atmosphere. Definitely a band to see live, they have an individual sound and their good time feels are infectious.\\nLate in the day and eager to experience the full force of this rock festival we head back to the Monster Stage for Crossfaith. There are a lot of bands out there boasting a “brutal” mosh pit but going front centre for a Crossfaith show really is a calculated risk. This band knows how to work a crowd without any frontman stunts – everything about them is real and raw. After a blinding set we are left sweaty, disoriented and wondering what the hell has just happened. Crossfaith chew us up and spit us out – and it was awesome.\\nPhotos: Scott Wight\\nNext up, Finch, a childhood favourite for about 90 per cent of the festivalgoers, if not for me. Nate Barcalow rattles out some of the best screams of the day, followed by some of the most powerful cleans we’ve heard. It’s a rarity to find these two talents in one man, and I, for one, will be rooting for their big comeback.\\nOver to the main stage, outdoors in Leeds’ Millennium Square, to see the now veteran rockers Taking Back Sunday. Hit and miss in the past, they are absolutely on form for Slam Dunk’s tenth anniversary. Adam Lazarra displays great vocals and serious fitness, bouncing around the stage, delivering the passionate performance expected of the main support. Deserving of their spot on the day, TBS give a stomping performance.\\nWe’re sunburnt, bruised and slightly squiffy, and it’s time for the headline act. But with brilliant bands conflicting there are some deep and meaningful discussions among the crowds about which to see. But with the rumours of a certain act going back to their roots in their setlist, for me at least it’s an obvious choice.\\nOpening with The Truth Is A Terrible Thing – their first performance of it in five years – You Me At Six immediately put the rumours to rest. They dive straight into Save It For The Bedroom and the crowd completely loses it. This is only the beginning. We are treated to vintage gems like Jealous Minds Think Alike, Take Off Your Colours, The Rumour and Always Attract – none of which have been played for two years or more.\\nThese, along with crowd favourites Stay With Me, Reckless and Loverboy, demonstrate their impressive canon and their ability to stay current and interesting for fans of all ages, backgrounds and tastes. With a powerful performance from every band member YMAS are a force to be reckoned with. A deserved main stage headliner at any festival but never more at home than at Slam Dunk.\\nSlam Dunk 2015, Millennium Square, Leeds, 23 May',\n",

       " 'Loudoun United went to Al Lang stadium to play the Eastern Conference leading Tampa Bay Rowdies, and did so with a couple of new wrinkles to the roster, with Griffin Yow now officially a D.C. United homegrown player, and Earl Edwards Jr. being a late loan to Loudoun. The 27-year-old goalkeeper, acquired in the offseason from Orlando City SC, started in place of Calle Brown after overcoming a groin injury to start the year.\\nIn addition to Edwards, D.C. Academy product Alexxon Saravia made his first start for Loudoun, as did Shinya Kadono, who replaced the injured D.C. homegrown/loanee Antonio Bustamante in midfield. The first half saw Loudoun attempt to battle the Rowdies’ 3-5-2 press and they were generally composed. Save for an occasional turnover, and sometimes combined with play by Edwards to clear a mistake, the first half was scoreless, and Loudoun, while having a scarce opportunity to attack, had no shots in the half.\\nThe second half saw evolution in Loudoun’s attack with some chances at Rowdies’ goalkeeper John McCarthy, though with no clear chance to steal any points Richie Williams appeared to strengthen his defense, with the addition of Jack-Jean Baptiste (making his USL debut) in the 65th minute. Loudoun’s shots continued to be ineffective as Orlando Sinclair (also making his USL debut) entered in the 77th and as the Rowdies hit the post. As Yow came off for Andrew Lubahn with 5 minutes left and a chance to get a point near, Loudoun continued their best to hold the back line, and a late volley by Rowdies substitute Leon Taylor in the box (one of several goal mouth opportunities the Rowdies had) went just wide of the net as Gabriele Giusti whistled full time in front of 5,893.\\nAfter being off for two weeks, Loudoun finds themselves off for two more weeks, with their next game at the Ottawa Fury on April 13 at 2pm.',\n",

       " 'A bob cut or bob is a short haircut for women (and occasionally men) in which the hair is typically cut straight around the head at about jaw-level, often with a fringe(or “bangs”) at the front. The bob is cut at the level of ears, below the ears or above shoulders.\\nHistorically, women in the West have usually worn their hair long. Although young girls, actresses and a few “advanced” or fashionable women had worn short hair even before World War I—for example in 1910 the French actress Polaire is described as having “a shock of short, dark hair”, a cut she adopted in the early 1890s—the style was not considered generally respectable until given impetus by the inconvenience of long hair to girls engaged in war work. English society beauty Lady Diana Cooper, who had had bobbed hair as a child, kept the style through her teenage years and continued in 1914 as an adult. Renowned dancer and fashion trendsetter Irene Castle introduced her “Castle bob” to a receptive American audience in 1915, and by 1920 the style was rapidly becoming fashionable. Popularized by film star Mary Thurman in the early 1920s and by Colleen Moore and Louise Brooks in the mid to late 1920s, it was still seen as a somewhat shocking statement of independence in young women known as flappers, as older people were used to seeing girls wearing long dresses and heavy Edwardian-style hair. Hairdressers, whose training was mainly in arranging and curling long hair, were slow to realise that short styles for women had arrived to stay, and so barbers in many cities found lines of women outside their shops, waiting to be shorn of hair that had taken many years to grow.\\nAlthough as early as 1922 the fashion correspondent of The Times was suggesting that bobbed hair was passé, by the mid-1920s the style (in various versions, often worn with a side-parting, curled or waved, and with the hair at the nape of the neck “shingled” short), was the dominant female hairstyle in the Western world. The style was spreading even beyond the West, as women who rejected traditional roles adopted the bob cut as a sign of modernity. Close-fitting cloche hats had also become very popular, and couldn’t be worn with long hair. Well-known bob-wearers were actresses Clara Bow and Joan Crawford, as well as Dutch film star Truus van Aalten.\\nAs the 1930s approached, women started to grow their hair longer, and the sharp lines of the bob were abandoned.\\n1960s and beyond\\nIn the mid 1960s, Vidal Sassoon made it popular again, using the shape of the early bob and making it more stylish in a simpler cut. Its resurgence coincided with the arrival of the “mop top” Beatle cut for men. Those associated with the bob at that time included the fashion designers Mary Quant and Jean Muir, actresses Nancy Kwan, Carolyn Jones, Barbara Feldon and Amanda Barrie, and singers as diverse as Keely Smith, Cilla Black, Billie Davis, Juliette Gréco, Mireille Mathieu and Beverly Bivens of the American group We Five. It was also popular with African-Americans in the mid-to-late 1960s, reflected in groups including Diana Ross & The Supremes and The Marvelettes. Many styles and combinations of the “bob” have evolved since. In the late 1980s, Siouxsie Sioux, lead singer of Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Corinne Drewery, singer of Swing Out Sister, had bob cuts for a short time. Singer Linda Ronstadt sported a very “Louise Brooks” inspired bob on the cover of two Grammy award winning albums in the late 1980s. 1987’s Trio album with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris and her 1989 release Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind. She also wears the cut in the video for her duet with James Ingram, Somewhere Out There. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue since 1988, apparently had hers trimmed every day (Times 2, 10 July 2006). In the early 1990s Cyndi Lauper had a bob haircut with very unusual colors; soon afterwards, the cut became identified with Uma Thurman‘s character of Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino‘s 1994 film Pulp Fiction. In the mid to late 1990s, T-Boz of TLC also had a bob haircut with very unusual colors that was asymmetrical with bangs. Also, for the first two seasons and the first two episodes of the third season of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, the character of Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) had a trademark bob haircut. Also, in Barry Sonnenfeld‘s 1997 film Men in Black, the character of Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino) also sported a bob.\\nIn November 2005, Canadian ice dancer Kristina Lenko was asked to join ITV1‘s new series, Dancing on Ice. She went to her stylist in Toronto and told him “Do whatever you like.” He cut Lenko’s waist length hair into what is referred to as an A-line bob, where the hairs shorter in the back and gradually longer toward the front, with the longest pieces toward the front of the face. Later, ex–Spice Girl Victoria Beckham decided to cut her own hair into such a style, helping to raise its popularity worldwide with girls asking hairdressers for a “Pob”—Beckham’s nickname Posh Spice conflated with “bob”.\\nIn 2007, R&B singer Rihanna had a bob haircut in the video for “Umbrella“. She has stated that she got her inspiration from Charlize Theron in Æon Flux. Keira Knightley had a bob in her short TV ad for Coco Mademoiselle. Actress Christina Ricci also had a bob for live-action movie version for 60s anime series Speed Racer and later onwards. Katie Holmes got a bob cut with bangs in 2007.\\nAt her third show in Brisbane, Australia, Britney Spears wore the bob throughout her concert. Jenny McCarthy is known for a sporting an A-line bob.

       " 'Why Is There So Much To Football I Hate??\\nPosted on May 19, 2010\\nBit of a blog delay here, I have been away on a short, but lovely break in the Herefordshire Countryside, it was a cracking weekend with great company, great food, and great wine.\\nHowever this didn’t stop me watching two live football matches over the weekend, the first time I have done this in years, firstly the Cup Final on Saturday, then the Division One play off semi final on Monday night.\\nI used to love football, and I still believe that a thrilling game of football is more exciting than any other sport, the tribal instinct that comes out of players and fans in games such as the Germany v England World Cup Semi Final in 1990 cannot be matched by anything else in my opinion. England’s 2005 Ashes series victory, and the last gasp win against Australia in the 2003 Rugby World Cup were epic sporting occasions, but nothing touches football for the intensity of the rivalry, so what a shame it is that it is packed full of utter pricks at all levels.\\nFrom Lord Triesman claiming that Jonny Foreigner (Spain and Russia) is about to bribe Refs at the 2010 World Cup, to gum chewing snarling dictator Alex Ferguson, right through to badge kissing players, and fat fans crying for the Sky cameras after relegation, there is so much to hate about football.\\nChelsea are top of my hate list, they have so many players that are just peasants who have come in to cash, they snarl, they rip their shirts off and puff their waxed chests out, they kiss their club badge whilst refusing to sign a new contract unless there is another 30k a week on the table, and yet there is still something far worse than any of this. PRETENDING TO ROCK A BABY AS A GOAL CELEBRATION FOR A WAG WHO HAS JUST GIVEN BIRTH AAAAAAAAAAAAAARGGGHHHH!!! The first act of the new parliament should have been to introduce the public flogging of footballers who carry out this sickening act.\\nSome people would say that I am just jealous of the riches and celebrity these cunts (I am sorry I can’t just call them buggers) enjoy, but if that was the case why am I not jealous of Paul Scholes or Ryan Giggs for example? One presumes they are mega rich, but their conduct is a breath of fresh air to the rest. Roy Hodgson the Manager of Fulham is another example, you just can’t dislike him or his team. He is a strange loveable character talking like Harold Steptoe, and actually looking like someone from an early 1970’s Michael Caine film like the Italian job. Maybe it is an Ashes to Ashes remake; “My name is Roy Hodgson. In 1972 I was hit by a car, and now I am a manager of a Football club in 2010, is it a dream, or am I dead, and if I am alive, how do I get away from this fucking nonsense and back to my normal life.”\\nImagine if next season started and Hodgson had just disappeared like he had never been there!\\nHodgson: Time travel Ashes to Ashes style?\\nI am just not excited about the World Cup like I have been in the past, but I guess I will get more in to it as it approaches, and maybe in between the diving, the cheating, and the exaggerated commentary whenever Christiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi touch the ball, we might get some exciting football.\\nIt is just a relief that John Terry has been stripped of the captaincy of England, it would be hard to feel pleased for him if a limited England side pulled out all the stops and won the World Cup in South Africa. I just can’t like the guy, or any of his Chelsea team mates. Part of me would rather see us not win it just to avoid the pain of seeing a pratt like of him parading around Trafalgar Square covered in tickertape.',\n",

       " 'In Washington, divorcing parents have a handful of options when it comes to structuring custody and parenting time after their divorce. One of these options is to establish a joint custody arrangement. When divorced parents share joint custody, each parent spends an equal (or roughly equal) amount of time with their children. For example, they may alternate custody on a weekly basis, or they may agree to an alternate arrangement that better suits their respective work schedules while also serving the best interests of their children.\\nWhile joint custody can be a good option under the right circumstances, it also inherently presents certain challenges for divorced parents. Divorced parents who share joint custody will need to continue to communicate, and they will need to be cooperative with one another in order to provide as much stability for their children as possible.\\n7 Tips for Maintaining an Amicable Joint Custody Arrangement after Your Divorce\\nIf you are considering a joint custody agreement, or if you currently have a joint custody agreement and are facing challenges in dealing with your former spouse, what can you do to make your parenting arrangement more amicable? Here are some tips from the custody lawyers at Bolan Law Group.:\\nTip #1: Make Sure You Know the Terms of Your Joint Custody Agreement\\nIn many cases, divorced parents run into issues because one or both of them have an inaccurate understanding of the terms of their joint custody agreement. In order to ensure that you are upholding your end of the deal – and to make sure you have a clear understanding of your former spouse’s obligations as well – it is important to carefully review the terms of your agreement.\\nWhat does your joint custody agreement say about transportation? What does it say about pick-up and drop-off windows? What does it say about phone time, curfews, and other similar types of parenting issues? Before discussing issues or concerns with your former spouse, you will want to make sure you know exactly what your agreement says with regard to your respective rights and responsibilities.\\nTip #2: Have a Plan for Communicating with Your Former Spouse\\nIf you need to discuss an issue with your former spouse, make sure you have a plan for how and when you communicate your concerns. For example, firing off a text message during your former spouse’s parenting time might not be as effective as carefully writing an email or suggesting that you need to schedule a mutually convenient time to talk. Oftentimes, disputes become contentious not because of what is said, but because of how the message is conveyed. If you set the stage for an amicable discussion, you may be able to achieve a positive outcome without engendering unwarranted hostility.\\nTip #3: Do Not Involve Your Children in Any Communications about Issues or Concerns\\nAfter a divorce, it is not uncommon for parents to only come into contact when their children are present. However, if you have concerns that you need to address or issues that you need to resolve, it is very important that you communicate with your former spouse outside of your children’s presence. Divorced parents should not involve their children in custody disputes, as this can have negative psychological effects that endure long after the issue is resolved.\\nIn this same vein, divorced parents should not ask their children to communicate messages for them, and they should not try to negatively influence their children’s perception of their other parent. Not only can these engender hostility between the parents and increase the likelihood of a contentious dispute, but they can have negative psychological effects for the children as well.\\nTip #4: Consider What Constitutes an Appropriate Response\\nWhile both parents should strictly adhere to the terms of their joint custody agreement, issues come up, and some grace is to be expected. If your former spouse is occasionally five minutes late dropping off your children, this is a very different matter from consistently “canceling” a pickup at the last minute.\\nIn order to maintain a peaceful joint custody arrangement, it may be necessary to overlook the occasional minor transgression. On the other hand, this can also be a slippery slope, and you also need to know when to say when. If your former spouse is not complying with your joint custody agreement and you have questions about what you should do, you should speak with an attorney before making any significant decisions.\\nTip #5: Seek Advice When Necessary\\nTransitioning to life after divorce is not easy, and adjusting to a joint custody arrangement takes time. If you are struggling, if you have questions, or if you are feeling isolated or helpless, you should not hesitate to seek advice. A family attorney can help you with any legal issues related to your joint custody arrangement, and friends, family members, and support groups can provide you with practical advice. Psychologists, social workers, and other professionals can provide invaluable advice for post-divorce parenting as well.\\nTip #6: Do Not Let Issues Linger\\nIf you run into an issue with your former spouse, it is generally not a good idea to let the issue linger. While some issues will go away, many will not. Addressing the issue before it gets worse can increase your chances of finding an amicable solution and help you maintain a peaceful joint custody arrangement.\\nTip #7: Seek a Modification If You Can No Longer Comply with Your Joint Custody Agreement\\nFinally, if your circumstances change and you are no longer able to comply with your joint custody agreement, this is an issue that you will want to address proactively as well. Violating the terms if your agreement can have serious consequences, and it’s something that you want to avoid if at all possible.\\nSpeak with a Custody Attorney at Bolan Law Group.\\nDo you have questions about establishing joint custody or what to do if you encounter a custody-related issue after your divorce?

       " '“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Romans 10:17)\\nNow, right off the bat as they say, the question for you, perhaps the most important question that will ever be asked of you, how is your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior expressed, how do you prove to yourself that you are hid in Christ, that you are the righteousness of God in Christ.\\nThere is no debating our salvation in our mind, not as a whole unit, you either know for a fact that you have been saved by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ or you do not. Forget those fleeting moments of doubt here for a moment, they are your flesh, your old nature trying to come up for air, forget the advances of Satanic forces whispering in your ear occasionally, answer the question, how is your faith in the Lord expressed not to the outside world, not to your spouse, children, friends or family, but in your heart?\\n“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?” (2nd Cor. 13:5)\\nIt’s one or the other, not both, not saved sometimes and the other at other times not saved, it isn’t the foolishness of the Roman Catholic cult and their lie of the “sin of presumption,” it isn’t the Mormons with their works-based ideologies or any other sinful religious organization that should enter into your mind here, it is what does your heart tells you, the heart that the Lord looks at, how does it express the knowledge, the unquestionable fact that Jesus Christ is the Lord of your life, that you are going to heaven, that you will spend eternity in the presence of the joy of the Lord, experiencing pleasures forevermore?\\nI hope you did not say, “It’s a feeling I have,” for that heart is deceitful continuously, and faith is not feeling saved, faith is the knowledge that you are saved.\\nWhat does your heart say? I hope it’s not any external evidence that sways your heart, plenty of food and water, a warm comfortable place to rest you head at night, fairly good health, or any other item that coerces your heart, as long as those items remain.\\nDo you believe your salvation is assured, beyond questioning, an absolute guarantee?\\nI will offer you what I can, but it is not the answer of your heart necessarily, no matter the circumstances or the possible consequences to yourself, that’s the best I have for you. If your heart can say that, then there is a very good possibility that you are indeed saved. But I offer you now, at least in what I have been shown to write in this short letter, one simple verse that will prove to you where your heart truly is, where your faith truly lies.\\nIf you read it and mean it, if your heart rejoices in it no matter where the Lord leads you for the glory of God, if you can honestly say Thy will be done when you read this verse, then rejoice greatly, for your rewards will be great, and you will stand in the presence of God Himself. That verse?\\n“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” (Phil. 1:21)',\n",

       " 'The municipality will hear a delegation from Woodfibre LNG next month to discuss the liquefied natural gas facility being constructed outside Squamish.\\nThe company requested a presentation at an upcoming council meeting to talk about the project, located at the site of the former Woodfibre pulp and paper mill southwest of the town. In a letter to Bowen Island Municipality the company says they’re “committed to contributing to a net-zero future, driven by innovation; ensuring meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous people; and providing positive socioeconomic benefits for Squamish and neighbouring communities, including Bowen Island.”\\nThe multi-billion dollar facility being built on Howe Sound will employ about 100 workers and produce millions of tonnes of LNG a year once fully operational. Final cleanup is expected this year, with construction beginning in 2023 and an anticipated completion date of 2027.\\n“2022 will be a milestone year for the company and we would appreciate the opportunity to provide a comprehensive update on our project to Bowen Island Mayor and Council,” wrote Julia Diamond, Woodfibre’s senior manager of government relations.\\nBut not everybody was eager to roll out the welcome mat. “My first reaction to this letter was quite negative,” said Coun. Maureen Nicholson during the March 28 meeting. “The last time the LNG roadshow came to Bowen Island was – from my perspective – a particularly unpleasant visit.”\\nBut Nicholson said after speaking with community members, “the response was basically, ‘bring it on’.”\\n“People are interested in hearing what was happened in the 6.5-7 years since Woodfibre spoke with us. For the delegation, I hope there actually will be an opportunity for the public to put forward their questions,” said Nicholson.\\nThe strongest opposition to the visit came from Coun. Sue Ellen Fast. “We need to spend our limited time at council meetings on significant business for our community, and not going over business that we’ve already made decisions about,” she said.\\n“Since February 2015 council has been passing motions of non-support of that Woodfibre LNG proposal,” said Fast, pointing out as recently as two years ago council voted to “direct staff to communicate to the Provincial Environmental Assessment Office that Bowen Island Municipality continues to not support the Woodfibre LNG project.” (Councillors Michael Kaile and Alison Morse opposed this directive, according to the minutes for the May 25, 2020 meeting.)\\n“So I think we should just receive the letter, but tell them we’ve done lots of work on it. They don’t need to take up our time at a council meeting about it,” continued Fast. “If they want to come and hold an open house or put an article in the Undercurrent, there’s lots of other venues.”\\nBut consensus seemed to be hearing from the company was for the best.\\n“I get Coun. Fast’s comments. On the flipside I think it’s important that we are in the loop and know what’s going on,” said Coun. Rob Wynen. “Even if we don’t support this project, I don’t see any reason why us knowing what is happening there is a hindrance.”\\n“I know some people have had questions about that operation, and it would be a chance for us to ask those questions and clarify anything we want to clarify… I think we should be open minded,” added Morse.\\nCouncil voted to have staff schedule a presentation date, with Fast the lone councillor in opposition.',\n",

       " 'A truly fascinating day. On several levels. Mostly with the extreme speed fish can vanish. It all began, with Jon...\\n1st Sailing. and it took three moves, but then we found some consistent bass fishing. Quality schoolies. Some other threatening to push 2.5lb. But most importantly, plenty of action, which has been missing the past couple of sailings. So, there were big smiles. And also, the wind which began with stiff and particularly chilly gusts, backed down as the air warmed from an early sun ascending in a cloudless sky. A common phenomenon these past few days. Something to do with the difference between land and sea temperatures perhaps. Calmed enough, to consider the big bass bank.\\n\"Jon, I know a place, where the bass don\\'t get caught under 5lb\" I said. \"Righto\" he replied, with that cheeky smirk that suggests he thinks I am pulling his leg. \"You don\\'t believe me do you? \" I enquired. \"Right... Reel up\" I passed him a heavier shad, and informed him we might get wet, as there was a bit of swell offshore.\\nOn arrival. I gave Jon strict instruction. And then I watched, as he took 8 fish to my halfhearted take, on consecutive drifts to the end of the session. Amazing. If a little frustrating. Sadly 3-4lb stamp. No sign of those long lean ones from a week ago. Most importantly, for my client, very enjoyable fishing. The pure delight each time his rod bent over. Especially when mine did not... One very happy Jon left the boat, and happened to bump into my clients for the next session. Bubbling away, he explained to them about the 25 fish, and the excellent average size.\\nShall I bother with writing the rest of this blog? As I am guessing you know where it is going. After really good action, I truly expected to pick up where I left off. But for Mark and Armando, it was simply a struggle. The wind had veered a little more easterly and increased, which restricted visiting the more deep marks. But nothing but a single schoolie for the entire session. The exact reverse of the 1st session. And I was very sad for the guys lack of action. But, they are seasoned BIF1 anglers, and have seen how it works.\\nNext up, was Bruno returning for another go. He had a great session on his previous trip, with bream and bass, and had already been fishing on the marina with a couple of plaice to his credit already. This session was slightly less severe than the previous one. Bruno had a mackerel, and we found a couple of schoolies. We even popped out to the big fish place over the low tide, but with the new flood, the wind suddenly tracked SE and got up forcing us back to inshore. This wind now became a major feature, with some very strange swells created by the wind veering NE, then SE, and blowing hard.\\nDespite all this, we fished on. And Bruno proved his patience warranted with a nice fish from a fairly inshore mark. But then nothing to the end of the session, despite really covering some reefs. Lots of bait fish showing on the sounder. But nothing interested to eat them. With the flood tide now pushing hard, the confused swell got worse. Combined with the poor fishing, I made the decision to cancel the final sailing.\\nBut every day is different. Indeed, as has been proven time and time again,. every sailing is often very different. Seeing what the next day is going to bring, is a lot of the fun of the job for me. And hopefully, through this blog, for you also.',\n",

So as we’re gifting treasures to our favorite people, we’re also creating an ugly amount of waste for our planet. It’s high time our thoughtfulness goes past what’s inside the box. Today, we’re teaming up with Allbirds and their #ScrapTheWrap campaign to bring you four charming, greener ways to wrap those gifts.\\nThink outside of the box, y’all. Literally.\\nAllbirds has long been a B+C favorite, and not just because of its cult-like following. The shoes are comfortable enough to wear sans socks (which this author does, often), and they’re machine washable too. What’s more, the shoes are made with ZQ-certified merino wool and other premium natural materials, so they’re gentle on the planet. Aside from the ever-popular Wool Runners and Wool Loungers, Allbirds now offers Smallbirds, AKA adorable, pint-sized Wool Runners for toddlers. How flippin’ cute are they?! Forgive the pun, but these are totally a shoe-in gift for anyone on your list.\\nNow, let’s get decorating!\\nDIY Snowy Maze Box\\nWhat’s more fun than opening gifts? Traveling through a snowy maze to reach the gift, first! (Hello, that’s why treasure hunts are so irresistible.) We painted a 3D maze onto an Allbirds box to maximize the FUN of opening the gift. Go the extra mile and gift a toy sheep as well to hint at the merino wool wonders inside.\\nScroll on for the DIY.\\nMaterials + Tools:\\n- Allbirds shoebox\\n- Remove the items from your box. Trace the full maze onto the box with a pencil. To really maximize the fun, we made sure the trail would go over four sides of the box before arriving at each shoe pocket. Draw decor around the maze, such as trees, snowcaps, or forest animals.\\n- Paint your designs on the exterior of the box, then let it dry.\\n- Finish up the outside of the box by painting the trail black. Feel free to add embellishments too!\\n- Once the outside of the box is completely dry, paint the inside of the box. We hid the gift recipient’s name inside the box to make it even more special. Add other personal touches as desired, then let it dry.\\nAdd your gift back into the box. You’re done!\\nAfter the big gift unveiling, save the box for future play adventures with your kiddos.\\n3 More Ways to #ScrapTheWrap\\nCotton Ball Sheep: Use leftover cotton balls and paper scraps to make 3D sheep! We hot glued these onto an old gift box, then added googly eyes for extra magic. Now that is one charming baaaaah-x :)\\nColor-Dipped Leaves: Dip found leaves in paint, let dry, then glue them onto your box. We used leftover house paint, but any paint lying around the house will do. (Heads Up: When gluing on the leaves, make sure the giftee can still open their present!)\\nParchment Paper Envelopes: Grab some scrap parchment paper leftover from cookie baking and get folding. Cut a square, then fold each corner into the center. Secure the corners with small sewn stitches or glue, then decorate the front as you see fit. We filled the envelopes with fabric scraps to hide the gifts within, then added leftover faux snow for a festive touch.\\nThere you go — four delightful, greener ways to decorate your gifts with no paper gift wrap in sight.

       " \"The 8 Best Pieces of Advice Top Nutritionists Ever Received\\nEver wonder what the absolute best jewel of advice nutritionists ever got from their mentors, professors, peers and even friends and family? So did we. When it comes to empowering yourself to eat healthy and feel energized, nutritionists have no shortage of amazing deets (and perhaps some outdated nutrition advice they wish you would skip already!). We tapped top RDs to dish out the best piece of food-related guidance they ever received. So go ahead, enjoy that nutrient-brimming PM snack and read on…\\n1. The most empowering way to take control of your health is to cook your own food! “The only way to know exactly what you are putting into your body is to be the person who selects the ingredients and the way the food is prepared. Having curiosity for why a food is nutritious or tastes good is inspiring and is what will keep [you] motivated to make the best eating choices. Nutrition is more than just calories — it is our small everyday choices that eventually lead to an accumulated lifetime of good nutrition,” says Rebecca Lewis, RD for HelloFresh, a leading healthy meal delivery kit company available nationwide, who says her mom and Michael Pollan have both been her biggest inspirations and teachers.\\n2. Nutrition is not just about nutrients. “Knowing the function of vitamins and minerals and which foods they’re found in is just one small part of nutrition. We don’t eat nutrients in isolation; we eat food, and sometimes complex meals,” says Kayleen St. John, RD, Executive Director of Nutrition and Strategic Development of Euphebe, sharing a piece of sage advice she picked up from a colleague, Laura Rosenberg. “Knowing that broccoli contains vitamin C is one thing, but being able to communicate why this matters and how to make a delicious meal containing broccoli is a different matter entirely.”\\n3. Put fruits and veggies first. “The most important, useful and inarguable advice I have ever received (and therefore, pass along to my clients and audiences) is to focus on fruits and vegetables,”shares Julieanna Hever, a plant-based dietitian and author of The Vegiterranean Diet. “Every major health organization in the world agrees with it. Fruits and vegetables are the most nutrient-dense, calorie-poor and health-promoting foods we have. Yet, fewer than 10 percent of Americans consume the minimum recommended intake.” Need to load up on more? Here are 11 recipes you’ll never know are filled with vegetables.\\n4. You can only take people as far as you have gone. “One of my nutrition counseling mentors and author Evelyn Tribole said this to encourage me to do my own work on self-acceptance and body image if I was going to be helpful to others learning to reject dieting in favor of intuitive eating,” offers Rebecca Scritchfield, RDN, author of the upcoming book, Body Kindness. Hallelujah to that attitude!\\n5. Food is more than just nutrition and numbers. “It connects us to our bodies and how it makes us feel both physically and emotionally (happy, strong, sad, tired, etc…). It helps create an opportunity to slow down and intimately bond with the people we share a meal with (friends, family, co-workers). It educates us about the farmers that dedicate their lives to raise, grow and produce the food for our world. And lastly, food crosses all cultural barriers to help us develop compassion and common ground even with those that are different than us,” shares Lewis. Think of your favorite memories in life — chances are, more than a handful involve being gathered around a table.\\n6. Don’t pay attention to food labels. Short and sweet but oh-so-true: “Ignore everything on the food label other than ingredients. Everything else is simply marketing,” cautions Hever. Curious to learn more? Check out nine techy ways to learn what’s really in your food.\\n7. It’s okay to have different views than “experts.” “The field of nutrition and the science that supports it is constantly evolving. Some of the most educated and brightest folks in the nutrition field disagree on what precisely constitutes a ‘healthy diet,'” says St. John, who learned this lesson from a professor at New York University, Dr. Kathleen Woolf. “It’s okay to have different opinions than others, just know where your opinions come from (beyond that you heard someone else say it!). Read articles and research constantly, and always ask why.”\\n8. Make healthy food taste good. “My culinary she-ro, celebrity chef and author Ellie Krieger, reminded me that people care about taste, first and foremost,” reveals Scritchfield. “I realized that instead of being the ‘food police,’ I should use ingredients like butter, salt and sugar to enhance the flavor and enjoyment of foods to help make it easier to eat healthy for a lifetime.” Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’re off to make healthy brownies (you’ll never know we slipped black beans in ’em!)…\\nWhat’s your favorite piece of healthy eating advice you’ve ever gotten?

       " 'If you’re thinking about getting married, there are many legal rewards that you might not need considered. However , these benefits can be equally as compelling. For example , the moment married couples file the taxes mutually, they are qualified to receive social protection benefits. And filing joint taxes makes it possible to save money since both parties are in charge of for the same taxation. These rewards are just a some of the many reasons why you ought to consider getting betrothed. And, of course , these benefits don’t stop there.\\nAside from tax benefits, matrimony has its own other rewards. Married couples tend to be able to manage to get thier own health insurance policy, gain access to their very own partner’s medical records, and qualify for residency rights in the U. Ings. Married couples could also shield their benefits with a prenuptial agreement, which will help protect their legal rights and make them closer to each other. Here are a couple other legal benefits of matrimony that you might desire to consider.\\nAnother advantage of being betrothed is that you may inherit a spouse’s property without having to pay taxes. An unmarried person must pay out taxes about that gift of money, and this is mostly a major reason why people choose to get married. Should you die intestate, however , you are going to still have privileges to your partner’s assets in cases where they pass away without view it a will certainly. You can generally get http://dosen.stikesdhb.ac.id/yeti/page/2555/ on your spouse’s health insurance approach as long as you’re covered by their company’s insurance. The home rate is particularly useful if neither other half has an employer-sponsored health system.\\nBesides marriage, prevalent law relationships have several benefits as well. While many states have a tendency recognize same-sex marriages, home-based partnerships are formal legal arrangements. To receive a common legislation marriage license, you must end up being over 18 years old, certainly not related to the other person, and not interested in one other domestic partnership. Depending on your state of residency, you could be eligible for rewards like medical leave and health insurance coverage. This can choose your life quite easy!\\nAside from these standard benefits of relationship, you may also love various legal benefits. Marriage will give you a joint savings account and reduce your costs of living. The state can even give you decreased income tax and property taxes. Additionally , you’ll have access to health and wellness14911 other monetary services. And you’ll become able to establish a prenuptial agreement. So , if you are planning to get married, make sure to use this00 legal benefit!\\nResearch have shown that married guys are less susceptible to commit chaotic crimes. Conceivably it is because they’re hitched and the added pressure of not discouraging their families and societal demands create them less likely to get into trouble. Nevertheless whatever the reason, there are several benefits to marriage. For instance , marriage can transform your life health and lower your stress levels. And as a extra, you won’t have to worry about getting divorced or settling for that bad spouse anymore!',\n",
       " 'Clarifi-FW - Advanced Freshwater Clarifier (500 mL)\\nAdvanced Clarifier for all Freshwater and Planted Aquariums\\n- Helps eliminate cloudy water\\n- Improves flocculation and water clarity\\n- Enables better particulate removal during mechanical filtration\\n- Safe for all freshwater fish, plants, and invertebrates\\nCloudy water in an aquarium is usually caused by different types of tiny particles floating in the water from too many nutrients, burrowing activities of fish and invertebrates, or strong water flow stirring up sediment. Clarifī-FW helps to clear cloudy water by using electrical charges to bind these particles together so that the resulting larger and heavier particles can be more easily filtered out or removed by siphoning.\\nInstructions & Guidelines\\nDo not use in marine aquaria; instead, use Clarifī-SW. Extensive research in our facility has revealed that maximum performance in freshwater and saltwater aquaria is achieved with different active ingredients rather than with one ingredient that is compatible in both types of aquaria. The active ingredients in Clarifī-FW are incompatible with marine aquaria.\\nShake bottle prior to use. Do not \"free pour\" into aquarium, which may result in excessive, persistent cloudiness. Flocculation of cloudiness due to blooms of microalgae may result in a depressed pH as the production of oxygen and uptake of carbon dioxide decrease; therefore, ensure that alkalinity measures at least 2 dKH prior to use and do not dose after display lights have turned off for the day (this is the period of time in which pH levels naturally decrease slightly, and an additional decrease in pH due to the afore-mentioned process may be stressful to aquarium inhabitants).\\nReplace or rinse mechanical filtration material prior to use; when filtration media nears capacity (signified by a significant decrease in water flow through the exhaust of the power filter, or pooling of water above horizontally-situated filter pad material), replace or rinse it, and repeat as necessary.\\nRecommended dosage is ~1-ml of Clarifī-FW per 10 US-gallons (37.9 L). Dilute up to 10-ml of Clarifī-FW per 8 fl-oz. or 250-ml of purified water and stir to disperse; gradually pour the resultant solution into the aquarium in an area of rapid water flow. Allow at least 12-hours for flocculation process to complete; re-apply in 24-hours if necessary. Maximum recommended usage is twice per 5 day period. Reoccurrence of cloudy water after Clarifī-FW has been employed to satisfactorily clarify water is an indication that issues referred to in Technical Background (opposite panel) may need to be addressed. The long-term successful care of aquaria relies upon the employment of sound husbandry principles.\\nClarifī-FW is not formulated to remedy water discoloration (e.g. \"yellow\" tint) caused by dissolved organic material; instead, employ activated carbon (e.g. Brightwell Aquatics Carbonīt-P) and/or macroadsorptive resin (e.g. Brightwell Aquatics OrganītR) for this purpose.\\nCaution: Do not use in marine aquaria; do not use at night. Keep out of reach of children. Not for human consumption.\\nActive Ingredients: Polyelectrolytes',\n",

       " 'People don\\'t relate to future threats from climate change but seeing images of people dying now from air pollution drives them to act, says former governor of California\\nGreen campaigners should stop talking about the risks from climate change in 2050 and talk about \"right now\", the former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has said.\\n\"It drives me crazy when people talk about 30 years from now, rising sea levels and so on,\" he told the Guardian in an interview at the Paris COP21 climate conference. \"What about right now? Thousands of people are dying from pollution. People are living with cancer [because of air pollution].\"\\nHe said campaigners should focus on the immediate effects of polluting the environment, because that resonates with the public in a way that distant visions of future harms do not. Most people find it hard to imagine the world in 2050 or 2100, the dates that are being discussed at the Paris conference for a \"long-term goal\" on climate action, he said.\\n\"There are people stuck in cancer wards now, tubes sticking out of them - 7 million people die a year because of pollution,\" he said. \"We should be talking about that.\"\\n\"Stuff that happens in the future does not mean anything to people,\" he said.\\nHe cited an advertising campaign in California that showed small children sucking air through an inhaler, because of the damage done to their respiratory systems by breathing polluted air. \"People saw this commercial, what we are doing to our kids, and thought ‘we have to protect our environment\\'.\"\\nPolls found that the ads were effective in persuading people of the need for new regulations, he said. \"All of a sudden, the poll numbers changed.\"\\n\"My job is to get the message out there,\" he added. \"If you do not have people behind you, you can\\'t do anything [on legislation]. Global warming is an extremely important issue, the most important issue. You have to communicate it properly. You have to communicate to people that this is right now.\"\\nAt the Paris climate change conference, entering its second and final week, governments are hoping to forge a new global agreement on limiting emissions that would kick in from 2020, when current commitments run out. A new draft text of an agreement was published on Saturday, and is now under scrutiny by the 195 governments gathered in France.\\nSchwarzenegger, a Republican, and internationally known as a star in films such as Terminator, was a strong proponent of action on air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, while in office. His successor, the Democrat Jerry Brown, joined him in Paris in calling for action on emissions. \"The Paris conference is the biggest leap forward in dealing with climate change. France has been instrumental in advancing this agenda,\" he told the Guardian.\\nSchwarzenegger said such joint efforts from both sides of the US political divide were essential to making progress on environmental problems. \"I never paid much attention to [political] parties,\" he said. \"This is a people\\'s issue, not a party issue.\"\\nHe said that \"sub-national\" authorities, such as state governors and assemblies in the US, and regional and city governments, could play an important role in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, by taking their own initiatives independently of national governments.\\n\"It is good that this is now being recognised,\" he said. \"It\\'s about [emphasising] efficiency, and alternatives [to fossil fuels].\"\\nCalifornia under successive administrations has brought forward a series of measures on air pollution and greenhouse gases, including a pioneering regional cap-and-trade system for carbon. Republicans in the Senate recently opposed Barack Obama\\'s \"historic\" Clean Power Plan to cut nationwide emissions from power plants, and Republican states have filed lawsuits against the regulations.\\nIn Paris, a group of Republican politicians from the US has been seeking meetings with the chief officials of leading developed and developing nations. They broadly oppose an international deal on climate change, while the Obama administration has pushed strongly for an ambitious deal in Paris.\\nA group of 10 Democratic senators also attended the talks at the weekend, pledging to help President Obama attain his environmental goals.\\nThis article first appeared at the Guardian\\nBusinessGreen is part of the Guardian Environment Network',\n",

All of them are sponsored in the IPL and Dhoni is earning from them. Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket in August this year. They are still the most favorite celebrity endorsing 16 brands.\\nEarnings up to 150 crores in IPL\\nAccording to data released by TAM Sports, Dhoni can earn 120 to 150 crores from endorsement in IPL. Dhoni is capable of positioning himself as an actor. They come as a distinct personality in every advertisement. Analysts believe that there are many reasons for the brand to select Dhoni. In this, especially athletes, actors are his specialty. However, Dhoni’s performance in the 13th season of IPL has been quite disappointing. Chennai Super Kings have played nine matches so far, of which they have won only 3 matches and have lost 6 matches.\\nA lot of companies bet on Dhoni\\nAnalysts say that if we look at IPL specifically, we find that Dhoni always emerges as a bigger brand than Virat. This is a big reason why a lot of companies bet on Dhoni in this season of IPL.

The experts have already made it clear that Dhoni is still another name for Vishwas for the brands and his retirement is not going to affect his earnings.',\n",
       " 'Social media influencer marketing is one of the fastest-growing online customer acquisition channels. And while influencers have gotten their fair share of bad press, there’s no denying the reach they have on the ever-important young demographic.\\nSocial media influencers can be found on common social platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. They span industries like fashion, beauty, home products and more. Influencers’ popularity is largely a result of both the trend toward engagement-based marketing and the credibility these individuals hold among consumers. In fact, 49 percent of consumers reported they relied on influencer recommendations, according to a report from Linqia.\\nWhen choosing an influencer to work with, have a firm grasp of your objectives. There are thousands of influencers to choose from in every space, so you want to partner with the right one for your business.\\nGeoff Crain, senior director of sales and marketing at Kingstar Media, recommends checking for fake followers and low engagement first, then seeing who has an authoritative voice in the space you’re looking to advertise in.\\n“For example,” he said, “if you are interested in increasing business in the fitness world, find influencers who are personal trainers or own their own gyms. Their followers engage with their content because they trust their voice to be legitimate when discussing the category in which they are experts.”\\nFlaherty added that asking for referrals is a great way to ensure you’re working with an effective influencer. “Not every influencer is the right influencer,” he said. “It depends greatly on your specific budget, your target market. Ask for referrals from other relevant businesses you know who use influencers.”\\nMeasuring the results of an influencer social media campaign might take a little extra planning. This effort is typically worth it for how many of your target customers you might attract. If you choose the right metrics and the right influencer, you can increase your market reach significantly. Evaluate which measurements make the most sense for you, and get started with influencer marketing today.',\n",

       " \"Adapting to Virtual Learning: Live with Rouben Mohiuddin\\nUpdated: Apr 15, 2021\\nWelcome back everyone, another week has gone by and it is nice to finally feel fall in the air! Last week in my blog and podcast I announced that after many years, I achieved my goal of becoming a licensed architect by 30. I am finally a licensed architect!\\nI am ecstatic to bring on the first guest of Design Create Inspire, an individual I admire and am grateful to have learned from in the beginning of my architecture career, Rouben Mohiuddin.\\nTo introduce Rouben, I will refer to his bio:\\nRouben Mohiuddin was born in Bangladesh on March 6th, 1973. At the mere age of three, his father took him on a 17-year journey to North Africa, Asia and Europe. This journey instilled in him with a bounty of diversity, which influenced what would become a lifelong appreciation for Art, Architecture and Design. He pursued an undergraduate degree in Architecture and Environmental Design (1995) and has a Masters of Architecture degree from the Southern California Institute of Architecture (1997). His architectural education was a trans-disciplinary education that integrated the arts, sciences, and the humanities through creative and analytical thinking and development.\\nRouben started his design career at select firms in Los Angeles and New York, specializing in custom residential projects and products. In 2002 he established Design SI. Although endlessly driven by the practice of design, he has always been inspired by the notion of ‘giving back’ through pro-bono community projects and has served as an educator at the University of California Los Angeles, Otis School of Art and Design, New York School of Interior Design, The Art Institute of California, and currently as Assistant Professor of Interior Architecture at California State University - Chico.\\nRouben enjoys fly-fishing, the outdoors and urban forestry. He and his wife, Trina, have a son, Zayd and reside in Chico, CA.\\nIn addition, Rouben is a hard-working, thoughtful designer who is inspired by giving back to his community through pro-bono community projects, specifically in Chico and the surrounding towns that have been devastated by recent fires. One project in particular, Rebuild Paradise, has been his most recent endeavor.\\nIn this week's podcast, you will hear how Rouben’s travels helped develop him as a designer, being exposed to multiple cultures all over the world from such a young age. It is quite funny that he landed in the small town of Chico, California, but it is the result of his “go with the flow” nature, his ability to explore and be open to new opportunities, specifically pursuing education rather than full time practice.\\nHis teaching journey began as a weekend professor, and with a twist of events and a family to support, the opportunity to become a full time professor presented itself. Years later, in the midst of a pandemic, I was interested in learning more about the design culture in virtual learning, as this field is extremely hands-on.\\nHis answer was what I expected, “I am figuring it out every day.”. The lecture part is easy, but getting to work has been a challenge, specifically being able to help each student. Rouben is able to help each student with his words, such as “What about moving that wall over there?”, but the struggle comes with not being able to physically reach out and correct the student. What he has noticed that has been working is having each student scan their work, send it along, then setting aside one on one time to connect with each student and go over their project.\\nWhat he has noticed is how virtual learning has streamlined the content, getting rid of busy work that is normally present in the classroom. As his first year students become more aware of different softwares, the group work will begin, but in the meantime students are working individually.\\nThe biggest challenge he has seen is a student struggling to achieve a certain skill and although it is just a simple, two second fix, he is not able to physically show them, thus resulting in the student wasting time trying to figure it out themselves.\\nLooking to the future, both Rouben and I are hoping for a hybrid situation to be implemented into the classroom, as many students’ creativity is sparked in the school environment, specifically from their peers.\\nOn the other end of experiences being missed is the ability to go to go on field trips. Currently, students are watching an abundance of videos to take the place of being physically in the building but it is not the same. For now it is okay, but he would like to take his students to a construction site, a concrete pour, or a specific building they are studying.\\nAdditionally, virtual classrooms are forcing students to become extremely organized. Unlike in the classroom where the students are able to explain their projects, everything must be self explanatory as the projects are all shared through a screen.\\nWhen asking which version of the classroom he prefers and if he is itching to get back into the classroom, Rouben stated there are pros and cons of both situations. What he misses the most is the energy that fills the room and the social aspect of the learning environment. An advantage of being online for the past few months is proving that there are a handful of classes that have the ability to be fully online, even after the pandemic.\\nAlthough Rouben lives in the college town of Chico, the town has seen a massive impact in the last few months, not only due to the pandemic. The neighboring town of Paradise recently experienced horrible fires, where many residents lost their homes, my in-laws included. Due to this natural disaster, many families from Paradise have relocated to Chico, creating a new environment of people.\\nAs a way to give back to the community, Rouben has gotten involved in pro-bono community projects and often brings students along. The idea of bringing students along started during his time at UCLA when the current architecture bid for the VA Hospital was too far out of budget. He asked if the team would be open to working with students and when they agreed, he presented this opportunity to his students. To his surprise, twenty students showed up to participate, contributing sketches, models, and infrastructural ideas for the hospital.\\nHis teaching philosophy stems back to this project, using his teaching to focus and give back to his community through projects. Through these projects he is able to instill certain values in his students, emphasizing the importance of serving and connecting with one’s community.\\nYears later, Rouben used this same model to get involved with the Rebuild Paradise Foundation. After being approached by the foundation, he suggested working with students under his guidance to create a plan to build a handful of homes for the community. The students were extremely involved, taking photos, gathering information, and asking the community, builders, and other designers what they believed would be the best components for the project.\\nThe design approach was something that could be simply built, something that the homeowner could build themselves. This project began in Fall 2019 and was presented right before the pandemic in Spring 2020, leaving Rouben with a stack of designs on his desk. He spent his summer going over these designs and a week ago, five designs, one being a container home, were finally approved. The simple, modest designs will be available to the public through the foundation. They are compiling all their research into a resource book that can be a source of information for anyone looking to build a home in a fire prone area.\\nIt is no secret that Rouben has had a life full of adventure, experiences that many can only dream of, and these experiences radiate through his work, his teaching, and his passions.\\nOutside of his work, his hobbies include anything non-architecture/design related, specifically going fishing and being in nature. He understands the importance of removing yourself from your work, yet his wife points out that he always finds design in his hobbies, something he cannot deny.\\nPlease share any insight on guest speakers you would like to hear on Design Create Inspire!

       " \"Covid-19 Cases Update\\nAdded at 16:31 on 13 November 2020\\nThe latest data can be viewed here, national data and data for Leicestershire.\\nComments from the Director of Public Health (Friday, 13th November)\\nFollowing a productive meeting with the Department for Health and Social Care after Leicestershire was excluded from a list published earlier this week by the Department, lateral flow test kits will be supplied to Leicestershire. The County Council will be able to hold a stock of kits and order additional kits, as needed, up to a maximum of 80,000 per week. The lateral flow kits are designed for use in asymptomatic testing. We are working up a plan to deploy them. Likely uses include mass testing in defined areas (eg. those wards associated with the highest rate of cases), to support care home visiting policies or in outbreak situations such as a workplace requiring whole workforce testing.\\nSince Tuesday the local rate of cases has increased markedly, standing at above 320/100,000 population today. This is significantly above the national average and has increased more quickly than increases in the national rate. Rates across the County in the 17-21’s are significantly higher than the national average. These increases may be a result of a ‘last hurrah’ before lockdown, although this does not explain why Leicestershire has been disproportionately affected.\\nImpact on Schools (previous week’s figures shown in brackets)\\n- Since the beginning of term there have been 650 (524) cases across 186 (170) schools affecting 426 (354) children and 224 (170) staff.\\n- Attendance across all schools was 85.5% (87.4%), including Covid-related absence.\\n- The ability of some schools to remain open due to staff illness or isolation and physical restrictions affecting the provision of Covid-secure capacity is an increasing concern.\\n- 616 early years settings were open at the start of the week with 8,644 children attending. It is predominantly childminders who have had to remain closed.\\n- There have been Covid-related cases in early years settings affecting 52 children and 69 staff.\\n- 114 (66%) care homes in the County have reported an outbreak of Covid-19. 22 (13%) homes have ongoing situations, an increase of 30% on last week. Testing results show 1.2% of residents tested positive, double the previous week, and 0.5% of staff tested positive.\\n- There are 3 care homes where there is a significant outbreak affecting larger numbers of both staff and residents – outbreaks are being contained and specialist teams are providing advice.\\n- Currently there are no designated care homes for people who are Covid-positive on discharge from hospital in the County but residents can access one care home in the City.\\n- A new care home visitor policy will be published shortly to take account of Government guidance.\\n- Day services risk assessments are being undertaken to determine what services can be safely provided. 60% of people have returned to services, and 19% of people do not wish to do so. Recent outbreaks have unfortunately resulted in closure of some services.\\nFREE SCHOOL MEALS AND OTHER FUNDING SUPPORT\\nConfirmation has been received that the Government will provide funding that can be used for free school meals to the end of the financial year. The Department for Work and Pensions states in respect of eligibility:\\n“County Councils and Unitary Authorities will determine eligibility in their area and target their support within the scope of the conditions set out below:\\n· at least 80% of the total funding will be ring-fenced to support families with children, with up to 20% of the total funding to other types of households, including individuals.\\n· at least 80% of the total funding will be ring-fenced to provide support with food, energy and water bills (including sewerage), with up to 20% on other items.”\\nThe County Council’s allocation is £1,462,000.\\nThe Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No 4) Regulations 2020 came into force on 5th November. The Secretary of State has enabled all local authorities in England to enforce Part 4 of the Regulations which deals with closure of and restrictions on businesses. The enforcement tools available to local authorities include prohibition notices, fixed penalty notices and when appropriate criminal proceedings may be instituted for serious breaches of the Regulations. The Police continue to lead on enforcement for breaches of the requirements placed on individuals and gatherings and both upper and lower tier local authorities continue to lead in relation to the obligations placed on businesses. However, it is recognised that there are inextricably linked incidents crossing all the regulatory requirements. In response, the Local Resilience Forum has established a Covid Compliance Enforcement Cell. A memorandum of understanding is in place to enable all agencies to share information to deliver a more collaborative, intelligence led enforcement response, with all partners adopting 'the 4 Es': Engage. Explain. Encourage. Enforce.\\nDue to non-compliances prior to the current lockdown, the County Council had placed a number of hospitality premises under restrictions to ensure adequate social distancing protocols were maintained, with one premises remaining closed to the public. These directions are now revoked. However, as we approach the automatic lifting of restrictions, Trading Standards officers will be engaging with these and other businesses to ensure appropriate measures are in place, in readiness for a reopening of businesses across the County when the lockdown is lifted.\\nThe Trading Standards Service is seeking to improve the quality of the data obtained from the district councils. The easing of the restrictions should coincide with the busiest trading period of the year as we approach the festive period. The Trading Standards Service will seek to deploy its enforcement resources, based on the evidence captured within the data, to ensure there is a focus on bringing the higher risk premises into compliance.\",\n",

       " 'But don’t let government bail out big pipeline projects for the sake of ‘jobs’\\n“So if not jobs, what is the proper economic justification for building pipelines? We need to keep in mind the goal of all economic activity: satisfying the wants and needs of consumers.”\\nBy C. Kenneth Reeder\\nThe pipeline battle rages on. On the pro-pipeline side, the argument revolves mainly around economics. And a big part of that argument is: pipelines create jobs.\\nIt’s true that it takes a lot of workers to build, operate and maintain a major pipeline.\\nAnd it’s understandable why politicians and industry make their case in terms of job creation. Voters like jobs, after all.\\nBut this is bad economics. All too often our public discourse treats employment as an end in itself.\\nThis is a big mistake.\\nIf we say the merit of building pipelines comes from the jobs created, then we have stepped into a trap. This trap opens the door for the government to throw taxpayer money at a project even when it no longer serves the interest of the marketplace.\\nAll for the sake of protecting “jobs.”\\nAnd indeed, this is what is happening. The Notley and Trudeau governments in Alberta and Ottawa have declared that they will provide a tax-funded safety net for investors in the highly controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.\\nWe see this argument come up whenever governments need to justify a bailout of some kind.\\nHarper’s government bailed out the auto industry for the sake of jobs. Trudeau’s government bailed out Bombardier for the sake of jobs. And so on.\\nSo if not jobs, what is the proper economic justification for building pipelines?\\nWe need to keep in mind the goal of all economic activity: satisfying the wants and needs of consumers.\\n(And remember: we’re all consumers, and even the most radical anti-oil environmentalists find it impossible to forsake the bounties of petroleum in their day-to-day lives).\\nPipelines provide an efficient way to move goods to where they are more valuable and thus more effectively satisfy consumers than otherwise.\\nWe frequently hear about the discount applied to Canadian crude due to strained transportation capacity and limited market access. Canadian heavy crude—which can be refined into a multitude of useful products—typically trades at a 25- to 30-per-cent discount off the West Texas Intermediate benchmark.\\nThe severity of this discount reflects the fact that Canadian producers cannot get the most capable and urgent buyers for their product. New pipelines help address this problem.\\nThat is the real key to the case for pipelines—increasing the capability to move energy products to where they are most needed.\\nEven if a major pipeline project only created a single job, it would still be worthwhile because of the service it provides in ultimately getting goods to consumers more efficiently.\\nOnly jobs that arise to serve the needs of consumers are desirable and can increase our standard of living. When the government throws money at something to “create” or “save” jobs, it ultimately makes everybody poorer.\\nMany jobs actually make society poorer. There is an old nerdy economist joke that mocks the idea of jobs for the sake of jobs, by absurdly proposing that the government hire folks to dig holes and refill them over and over.\\nMost people recognize that this would be pointless and keep people from finding useful jobs. But that is the logical path we walk if we think of jobs as an end in themselves.\\nNow consider the Trans Mountain situation.\\nIf Kinder Morgan abandons the Trans Mountain project, that is a strong indication that it would not represent an effective way to serve consumers, due to political and regulatory interference. It might be better that they allocate capital to other projects without such opposition.\\nIf they did this, it would be a strong indication that throwing taxpayer money at the problem for the sake of “jobs” would be a huge mistake. If people don’t want to put their own capital into a project—put their own skin in the game, so to speak—then it makes little sense for the government to step in and throw other people’s money at it.\\nResources are limited. We cannot have our cake and eat it too. We have to remember that some jobs must be destroyed for the government to subsidize other jobs. We want jobs that the market deems valuable for the sake of helping consumers, not jobs for the sake of jobs, regardless of the lack of value created.\\nLet’s build pipelines. Lots of pipelines. But let’s not do so because of jobs. Let’s do it to benefit consumers who need affordable energy to have a good life.\\nC.

       " 'ANNUAL WORKING REPORT- INDIA’S UNIQUE REQUIREMENT\\nThe requirement of filing Statement of commercial working of patents in India has been an integral part of the Indian Patents regime since inception. It has been observed in the recent years, that the dominant industries of the Indian market, especially pharmaceutical and telecom, have expressed their concerns against the requirement of Form 27, that is to state the working of their patented invention in India. The ongoing debate has almost transformed into a movement supported by Indian and Global industry alike, seeking a repeal or at the least introduction of radical changes to Section 146 of the Patents Act, 1970 [Act].\\nThe Annual Reports published by the Indian Patent Office [IPO] for the period of 2012 – 2017 indicate a positive change in the outlook of patent holders and a growing compliance rate in meeting the requirement of Form 27.\\nThe data published by the IPO in the Annual Reports as seen in the below table shows significant increase in the number of Form 27 filings in the past five years and is reflective of positive change in the attitude of the patent holders in these years.\\nAWR: AN OBLIGATORY REQUIREMENT:\\nFrom the standpoint of a patentee, the importance of ‘working’ an invention / consequences of non-working became evident when the first compulsory license was issued to Natco Pharma Ltd. in 2012 for Bayer Corporation’s patented drug Nexavar. Incomplete disclosure of information on Form 27 by Bayer and the failure of the drug to be worked to an adequate extent in the Indian territory proved to be Bayer’s Achilles heel and eventually resulted in a compulsory license being granted in favour of Natco. The Patent Office while granting the compulsory license adopted the view that working of a patent in India entails local manufacture in India. The only silver lining in the entire saga emerged when the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), after hearing the appeal against the decision of the Patent Office, disagreed with the Controller General’s findings regarding ‘importation’ and recognized that the working requirement could be met by importation. The IPAB clarified that importation is relevant for the purposes of determining whether an invention has been worked in India. Between then and now, there are a plethora of judgments which have recognized importation to be sufficient to meet the working requirement.\\nThe debate regarding working statement requirement was rekindled in the year 2015, when a a writ petition was filed before the Delhi High Court, to highlight lapses in the filing of statement of workings by patentees/licensees and lack of enforcement on part of the Patent Office. The objective of the writ petition was to request the Court to enforce patent working provisions and take necessary action to compel Patentees and Licensees to comply with the law.\\nThe following issues were considered by the Hon’ble High Court –\\nManifest failure to comply with Section 146 of the Act as well as no action initiated under Section 122 of the Act against the Patentees who did not follow the procedure,\\nWhether information provided under section 146 of the Act regarding licensees and sub-licensees is \"Confidential\" in nature.\\nThe Hon’ble High Court directed the IPO to undertake consultation with stakeholders and make necessary amendments to the relevant section in the Act and Form 27 within a strict timeline, as submitted by the IPO. Even though the timeline set by the Delhi High Court has expired, no amendments with respect to AWRs have been introduced yet.\\nFurther, the Hon’ble High Court held that the information regarding licensees (and sub-licensees) cannot be termed as confidential, as all information regarding the grant of patent is already available on the website of the IPO and failure to disclose such information by the Patentees would mean non-compliance with the requirements of Section 146 of the Act and thus, making such Patentees liable for action.\\nThe non-compliance or failure to adhere to the working requirement can attract a high penalty under Section 122 of the Act, which includes imposing a hefty fine of approximately USD 14,500 (INR 1 million). Furthermore, if the information provided in Form 27 is found to be false, the person furnishing such statement is liable to be punished with imprisonment (which may extend upto 6 months, or with fine, or both). However, such punishment or penalty for non-compliance has not been levied on any patent holder yet.\\nIn addition to the statutory provisions regarding the penalty, the Act under Section 64, confers a power on the Controller to order for revocation of a patent if he is convinced that the said invention has failed to be worked in the territory of India.\\nCertain unresolved problems related to Form 27 requirement continue to be debated and are hoped to be addressed in the future.\\nThe IPO has recently taken an initiative of issuing notice to the Attorneys/ Agents seeking compliance of Annual Working Report (AWR) i.e. Form 27 of their granted patents. It appears that this initiative is an indication of stronger enforcement of the statement of working requirement, in the times to come.\\nThe requirement of filing Form 27 in India is unique in many ways. One of the paramount rationales behind it is to prevent the Patentees from creating blocking monopolies, i.e. obtaining and maintaining patents for the purpose of blocking others from developing technologies in the vicinity of the patented inventions.\\nAs stipulated in Section 83 of the Act that patents are not granted merely to enable patentees to enjoy a monopoly on a patented article, but to secure that the inventions are worked in India on a commercial scale and to the fullest extent that is reasonably practicable without undue delay. The working statements of the invention undoubtedly give a concrete and clear idea about the effectiveness and commercial viability of an invention, they are important for valuation of patent portfolios and most importantly for issuance of compulsory licensing. Working statements are undeniably one of the important pillars to maintain the transparency of the system and help in preventing a blockage in the scope of creativity of inventions in the Indian patents regime.\\nHaving said that, there is no doubt that the AWR system requires a relook. The threat of imprisonment and hefty monetary fines for non-filing of statement of working may be counterproductive to the growth of patent filings in India since it will be one of the aspects which patent applicants will consider while choosing India as a jurisdiction for patent protection. Moreover, it is not fair for hefty financial penalties to be imposed on patentees given that exemplary damages are not awarded against infringers in patent infringement lawsuits. Reforms are needed to ensure that business sensitive information is not published by the Patent Office under the garb of Form 27 requirements.\\n C.L.A.

       " 'Now with over 90 strains of weed and The Serenity Room\\nWashr Online Laundromat in Cape Town\\nThe cyber pick-up and delivery service that’s revolutionising the way we clean our clothes\\nOne of life’s greatest schleps is doing the dirty washing. It’s a relentless, soul-sucking chore that spins all the fun out of a potentially great day and sponges up valuable time that could be used doing more important things, like for instance, knocking back a beer or squeezing in an afternoon snooze.\\nFiddling around on your iPhone, Galaxy S5 or Apple Mac, however, is more heaven than hassle. So, three Mother City-based digital entrepreneurs weighed these two facts against each other and, after some deliberation and a look at successful overseas operations (like Washio), decided to launch Washr, South Africa’s first online laundromat, to make life a little easier for locals.\\n“Everyone needs to get laundry done at least once or twice a week,” asserts co-founder David Shleifman, “so we decided to do something that could free people up from this undesirable household chore so that they can have more time to relax or focus on work.”\\nTo benefit from the convenience of this mobile-friendly e-service, all that Capetonians have to do is visit the venture’s super user-friendly website (Washr.co.za) on a PC or smartphone, register by filling out a short form and then place an order, specifying the date, time and place they’d like their dirty clothes to be collected. A driver will then arrive at the requested location within the chosen hour slot to collect the laundry and whip it off to be washed, dried and folded, and within the next 24 hours, garments will be returned to the specified address, smelling fresh and looking spotless (the turnaround time is only longer than 24 hours for complex dry cleaning requests).\\nPick-up and delivery is 100% free, and all orders are on demand, which means that if you want your socks and undies rinsed right now, Washr will be at your doorstep within two hours of the order being placed, so you don’t have to recycle old items day after day until you have the time to wash them on the weekend.\\nThe touch-of-a-button business, which has been billed as the ‘Uber for laundry’, currently services busy urbanites based in the CBD, on the Atlantic Seaboard or in the Southern Suburbs and will soon expand to other areas too. It only works with reputable, eco-friendly laundromats in and around Cape Town and will wash and dry clean absolutely anything that can be washed or dry cleaned, from work shirts, winter coats and evening dresses to sleeping bags, double-bed duvets, curtains and carpets. Customers can also make a note on the online form if they want a specific item to be ironed or to receive special care.\\nAnd the cherry on the proverbial cake? When clean clothes are delivered to your office space or home, the neatly folded package comes complete with a chocolate or cookie of some kind – a nice little touch that speaks volumes for the personal service that this Mother City start-up promises.\\nAside from the surprise treat though, it’s the click-of-a-button convenience that makes this cyber washroom so wonderfully appealing. It’s definitely going some way towards saving critical beer-drinking time and lessening the dullness of domestic life.\\nTip: Washr is offering all CapeTownMagazine.com readers 10% off their first laundry load.

       " 'There are a few moments in marriage when you have to decide, \"Is this worth it?\"\\nI had this particular moment a few days ago when I found this little cupcake at Kraftsmen Cafe. It had my husband\\'s name written all over it but boy did I know it was a delicious treat. I had full intention to bring it home to him but I also thought, \"He\\'d never know.\"\\nThe cute, little cupcake DID make it home, but there was a much sweeter lesson in this cookie monster scenario.\\nThough we may have full intent to do the right thing, sometimes we get side tracked with what we see with our fleshy, googly eyes. We must lean on God because He knows all and He sees all.\\nNot only did I not miss the calories, my heart was free and clear of any sort of shame or guilt and I actually came out looking like the best wife ever.\\nClearly this life lesson can be far more difficult when it comes to the lust of the eyes but I will not ever forget how Cookie Monster\\'s googly eyes spoke to me. It\\'s eyes reminded me of mine when there is something I think or feel is better, sweeter or more appealing.\\nMy eyes get wide eyed, fixated on something I want. My haughty eyes are so super focused on the topic, job or person that my mouth drops, beginning to covet what my eyes have tricked me into believing is mine or something I must have.\\nAnd with God\\'s grace, sometimes I come out looking like the best wife ever. And sometimes I do not but today, I\\'m grateful for the heart God has given me.

       " 'What is a pre-sale?\\nOne consideration to a new home or condo purchase is the ability to purchase a pre-sale property. You may have heard of this term before, it is defined as “a sale held or made before an item is made generally available for purchase”. This means that you are essentially reserving your home and sale price, guaranteed with a non-refundable reservation fee, until the time comes to write the purchase contract, and that timing can vary by builder and project.\\nWhy buy pre-sale?\\nGenerally there will be a larger selection of suites to choose from in the pre-selling phase as many new home buyers prefer to wait until construction is further along to purchase. You will have to rely on builder floorplans and images to envision your space, and luckily with Carrington Communities, you can visit a variety of showsuites and condos throughout Edmonton to get a good understanding of the space you are reserving.\\nPre-sale condos are unfinished condos, so with Carrington that means you have the chance to choose your interior finishing selections or packages, including cabinets, flooring, backsplashes, and lighting. This gives you a personalized design that fits your needs, style and personality.\\nAnother advantage of buying during the pre-sale phase is that you will have time to save up and anticipate your closing costs. You are only required to put down a reservation fee (the amount can vary between projects), this is much lower than your required 5% downpayment giving you additional time to save up and also put aside some of the closing costs you need.\\nSo if you can use a bit of creativity and imagination buying pre-sale gives you the opportunity to secure the condo of your dreams early on!\\nAre pre-sale prices lower?\\nMarket conditions dictate new home prices, so it really depends on when you buy. With Edmonton’s ideal housing prices you may have the opportunity to build some equity before you even move in, but that will depend on a lot of other factors down the road as future market conditions cannot be guaranteed.\\nOne thing to consider is your mortgage approval, you will need to wait until you have entered a contract to fully secure your mortgage rate. You should still get pre-approved so that you can be confident you will be able to afford your new home when the time comes. With Carrington and our trusted mortgage partner Ownest Financial it is easy to get pre-approved, all from the comfort of your home.\\nWhere can I learn more?\\nVisit our communities currently in the pre-sale stage, including Edge and Elan, both in southwest Edmonton. Our experienced sales associates can guide you through the process from pre-sale to contract to possession.',\n",

       " 'Welcome to our winter coaching walk, the next in our series of blog posts by Juliet Flynn about using the natural seasonal shifts as prompts for our thinking.\\nI had hoped as I wrote to be inspired by a view outside of a snowy scene, a picture postcard winter. However, snow is much less common here in the UK than its place in my childhood memories would suggest, so my view is instead more grey than sparkling white! I am just back from a short walk and, despite the dull cold, it was still a refreshing and reflective opportunity.\\nWinter can conjure up images of hiding, scarcity and retreat, long periods of darkness and loss. But what if we were to view it with a different lens?\\n“Winter is a time of withdrawing from the world, maximising scant resources, carrying out acts of brutal efficiency and vanishing from sight; but that’s where the transformation occurs. Winter is not the death of the life cycle, but its crucible.”“Wintering”, Katherine May\\nWinter is challenging to the natural world, but not fatal; if it were, we would not be here. As humans, we have evolved to protect ourselves from its harsher elements, inside our centrally heated homes or outside in our insulated clothing. Have we perhaps lost our connection to its purpose, its meaning? The opportunity to recover and rest, face harsh elements with courage and emerge stronger? Let’s use our coaching walk today to reconnect.\\nWe start, as ever, with a moment to settle into our walking space. If your walk is going to be out in the elements, perhaps use your piling on of layers, hats, scarfs, boots etc. as that opportunity – do it mindfully, notice how each thing feels against your skin, express gratitude for each item and how it will protect you once you step outside.\\nIf your walk is inside due to self-isolation or simply the cold, then we can repeat a similar ritual – look around mindfully, notice which elements of your home are protecting you from the outside and express a moment of gratitude.\\nAnd then take a step. It might be small and tentative, like mine was today on the icy pavements. Winter is not a time for large, exaggerated movements, rushes of energy or explosive displays of momentum. We want to conserve our energy to see us through the scarcity of the season, and our walk can reflect that.\\nLook up and around you. What do you notice about the way nature prepares and responds to winter? Find something that is a wintery item and explore its metaphor for you. Ask yourself, “How does this represent my winter, and how does that make me feel?” If you aren’t sure, use this rather ordinary winter photo of mine, because in any scene there can be inspiration:\\nWhat do you notice? The tree’s bare branches holding the weight of the snow? The yellow daffodils determined to share a splash of colour? The hanging bird feeder, the cleared path, the grey sky, the twilight haze, the lamp reflected in the window? What do they mean in metaphor to you?\\nI see a stoic cherry tree, having suffered a spate of blackfly earlier in the year, courageously and resolutely holding firm to its frame, buoyed briefly by the visiting starlings when they come to feed. I can connect to that – this last year has thrown us many challenges, but I am still here, my similarly stoic core knowing that this too will pass and if I just focus on keeping myself strong, healthy and secure along with the occasional moment of joy, then I will be ok.\\nWhat is your winter story? Perhaps these questions prompt something for you:\\n- Without the rich abundance and flashy colour of the other seasons around us, what do we notice is at the core of what we need to stay alive and safe?\\n- In our work, in our lives, what will help us flourish in lean times?\\n- What benefit would a period of hibernation and self-care bring, and what might it look like?\\n- Hibernation and rest is important, but what might you instead be hiding or retreating from that deserves your attention?\\nWinter, of course, is not just about holding on… earlier in winter we have festivals and joy, celebration and warmth, reflection and family: Christmas, Saturnalia, Hanukah, Yule, Hogmanay and others. And, of course, some more contemporary traditions such as the many Boxing Day or New Years Day icy sea swims (plunging into freezing water is apparently good for you — I’ll happily leave that particular experience to others.)\\nAnd for some this is their first winter so they may not be quite sure what to make of it yet…\\nYou can connect with Juliet on LinkedIn here.\\nGet Free Coaching and Mindfulness Resources\\nJoin our community for free and get a host of free resources, including our guide to becoming a professional coach, access to our coaching webinars, a free mindfulness e-kit and much more.',\n",

       " 'Three weeks before the official end of tax season, the IRS has issued nearly 50 million tax refunds. But many others are still waiting for a refund. In addition, the agency has ait\\'s processing from prior years — far more than the 1 million it usually has going into a tax season.\\nHere\\'s whymight be taking longer this year — and what taxpayers might do about it.\\nWhy could tax refunds be delayed?\\nThere are a number of reasons a refund might be held back. Math errors or simple typos are often responsible. Common mistakes the IRS has flagged as leading to delays include: selecting an incorrect filing status; forgetting to list all income including bank interest and unemployment compensation; not answering a question on trading cryptocurrency; or having a typo in your name, address, Social Security number or bank account number.\\nThis year, the pandemic\\'s Economic Impact Payments — also known as stimulus checks — are creating an extra hurdle for taxpayers, leading to a \"significantly higher error rate\" on returns, according to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.\\nFilers will need to correctly enter any stimulus payments they received and the numbers will need to match up with IRS records. However, \"far more than 10 million\" Americans have put in numbers that don\\'t match up, leading to delays, Rettig told Congress last week.\\nOther delays are due to Congress changing the tax law to allow Americans to use 2019 or 2020 income to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit. This change took place after the IRS had already updated its IT systems for the 2021 tax year, Rettig noted, meaning that taxpayers who take advantage of that law will need to have their returns manually reviewed by an IRS staffer.\\nUnderstaffing is also taking a toll, with shrinking headcount at the IRS close to levels not seen since 1974, according to Rettig.\\nAlso, the IRS is taking longer to issue refunds for some returns filed for earlier years, the agency said. The IRS\\' website states that some tax returns for the 2020 year are taking longer to process and refunds are taking longer than 21 days to be issued.\\nHow long will refunds be delayed?\\nIn, the IRS issues most refunds within 21 days of processing a tax return. This year, tax pros aren\\'t optimistic about that time frame.\\n\"You\\'re not going to get your money in two weeks, so don\\'t have unrealistic expectations,\" said Robert Seltzer, a CPA based in Los Angeles.\\nEven the IRS is warning taxpayers they may have to wait. The agency on its website \"cautions taxpayers not to rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills.\"\\nSeltzer advised taxpayers to start checking their refund status online three weeks after they\\'ve submitted their return.\\nI filed an amended return for a past year — what should I do?\\nThe IRS said it\\'s taking longer to process tax returns for the 2020 tax year, and up to a month longer to process amended returns.\\n\"It\\'s taking us more than 20 weeks (instead of up to 16 weeks) to process amended returns,\" the agency said on its site. \"Do not file a second tax return or call the IRS,\" the agency said.\\nTaxpayers who filed an amended return should be able to check its status online with the IRS as soon as about three weeks after the return was sent to the agency. It can take up to 20 weeks, or five months, for a return to be processed.\\nSeltzer has several clients who are still waiting on refunds from the 2020 tax year, one of whom filed in late July. One of them had no choice but to file on paper, which prolongs the issuing of a refund, he noted.\\n\"You really must take every step you can to file electronically, because paper returns literally go into a black hole; it takes forever to get them processed,\" he said.\\nUnfortunately, amended returns are often the last priority for the IRS — even more so during a busy filing season, said financial columnist Michelle Singletary.\\nHow can I find the status of my refund?\\nThe IRS\\' \"where\\'s my refund\" tool lets taxpayers check on the whereabouts of their refund.\\nTo check, taxpayers will need their Social Security number or Individual Tax Filing Number, filing status and the exact dollar amount of their refund. Information is updated 24 hours after someone electronically files their return, and the status of refunds is updated once a day, usually overnight, according to the agency.\\nStill, the tool is limited, the National Taxpayer Advocate noted in its latest report, because it doesn\\'t explain the reason for a delay or what a taxpayer needs to do to fix a delayed return.\\nWhen should I call the IRS?\\nTaxpayers hoping to get a person on the phone will face an uphill battle. The agency last year answered only 1 in 9 phone calls, with an average hold time of 23 minutes, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate.\\nThe IRS says taxpayers should call about their refund in just a few circumstances:\\nWhen it has been longer than 21 days since the return was electronically filed.\\nWhen it has been six weeks or more since the return was mailed.\\nIf the \"Where\\'s My Refund?\" tool instructs someone to contact the IRS.\\nfor more features.',\n",

       " 'An antitrust lawsuit over the proposed mega-merger between T-Mobile and Sprint is now in the hands of a federal judge after an attorney for more than a dozen states called the deal “presumptively anticompetitive.”\\nU.S. District Judge Victor Marrero of New York heard final arguments Wednesday in the trial over a merger that would form a third national wireless giant alongside Verizon and AT&T.\\nT-Mobile and Sprint want to “create a new, world class network with lower costs and better service for consumers,” David Gelfand, an attorney for the companies, told the judge, adding that “the world with the merger holds tremendous promise to revolutionize the industry.”\\nBut Glenn Pomerantz, the lead counsel for the states, argued the merger was “presumptively anticompetitive” and that the remedies proposed to address its effects — including the sale of Sprint’s prepaid business and some wireless spectrum to Dish Network — were inadequate.\\nIf T-Mobile and Sprint merge, consumers would be “at risk for paying billions of dollars more every single year” for wireless services, he said.\\nWitnesses in the trial included former Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, T-Mobile CEO John Legere, and Dish CEO Charlie Ergen.\\n“Many investors believe that the case hinges on Charlie Ergen’s ability to establish himself and Dish as a viable and credible fourth wireless competitor,” analyst Walt Piecyk at Lightshed Partners wrote in a client note. “We believe he did that … under cross examination.”\\nPomerantz pointed out in his closing argument that even if Dish does enter the wireless market, it will take years to build its own network and establish a customer base anywhere near where Sprint’s is now.\\nHe also rejected the companies’ claim that Sprint will cease to be a meaningful competitor if the merger fails, calling it “the Hail Mary Pass” of defenses in antitrust cases. “Sprint simply needs to pull up its sleeves and compete,” he said.\\nPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, put the odds of Judge Marrero approving the merger at only 40%. The states “likely raised enough questions about [the] Dish fix and merger synergies to prevent Marrero from accepting them,” he said.\\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'The Contribution of Voluntary Sustainability Systems to Women’s Participation and Leadership in Decision-Making: A Strategic Evidence Review\\nAs more Voluntary Sustainability Standards/Systems (VSS) increase their efforts to address gender inequality in agri-food value chains, the timing is ripe to reflect on progress to inform future strategies and research. This paper revisits the body of evidence on VSS and gender equality through the lens of SDG5.5 specifically, to identify if and especially how VSS may support women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership in decision-making in rural communities. The objectives of this strategic evidence review were two-fold: first, to review what the existing research on VSS and gender equality reveals on the contributions made specifically to women’s participation and leadership in decision-making; and secondly, to identify knowledge gaps to inform the direction of future research on this topic.\\nMorgan, M.; Zaremba, H.',\n",
       " \"BRISTOL, UK — The NFTS has launched a new animation course in partnership with the Aardman Animations (www.aardman.com), here, in an effort to meet the growing demand for animators in the UK. The three-month “Certificate in Character Animation” course will be taught by lead by Aardman’s head of animation Loyd Price and supervising senior CG animator Mathew Rees.\\nPrice has contributed towards Nightmare before Christmas, Chicken Run, The Curse of the WereRabbit, Flushed Away and Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists. Rees has worked on commercials for Serta, Chevron, British Gas and Hershey’s as well as on Pirates!. The Bristol based studio has won four Oscars and had 10 Oscar nominations.\\nThe 12–week intensive course will take place at Aardman’s Bristol headquarters and will provide the core practical skills needed to become pro animators. The majority of the course is practical, with participants working on animation exercises to improve their skills, knowledge and experience. This will also be supported by animation theory. It culminates in a short character animation sequence — pre-planned and boarded — to showcase the skills learned during the course.\\nThe NFTS's stop-frame animated film Head Over Heels was nominated for Best Short Animation this year – the only film school nominated for an Oscar in 2013. The school’s stop-frame animated film Miss Todd is also a finalist in the Oscar qualifying 2013 student Academy Awards.\",\n",
       " 'Founded eight years ago, EBH Polska\\nis a Warsaw-based post production and rental house known for its ongoing collaborations with Polish National TV, TVN, Polsat and CANAL+. The company has provided its services and equipment for several venerable Polish TV series, feature films and documentaries over the years. Recently, EBH employed two AJA Ki Pro Mini digital video recorders to help complete \"Mission: Afghanistan,\" a 13-episode series about a Polish Military Mission in Afghanistan that began airing on CANAL+ late last year.\\nProduced by AKSON STUDIO and directed by Maciej Dejczer with cinematography by Jarek Szoda, the dynamic, action-packed series brought a production crew and EBH assistants into treacherous terrain far from Warsaw for an 80-day shoot. EBH Polska Co-Owner Maciej Ostoja Chyznski explained, \"The idea was to leverage the more rugged topography of Poland to recreate an Afghan landscape for the show. Environmental conditions, however, proved to be the worst you could imagine - 80 days of dust, dust and more dust, in addition to extreme heat from blistering summer temperatures.\"\\nAware of the conditions the team would face, early on EBH set out to find a lightweight Apple ProRes recorder that could survive the environmental challenges posed by the shoot. After several days of testing a variety of available options out on the market, the EBH team decided that Ki Pro Mini was the best recorder for the job.\\n\"Ki Pro Mini won hands down in all of our tests. It proved durable and portable, and recorded the highest quality ProRes, plus it\\'s easy to learn and use. We also performed worst-case-scenario testing and it passed with flying colors,\" shared EBH Co-Owner Filip Kovcin. \"Having used a number of AJA solutions throughout the years, we also knew it would prove reliable for this sort of shoot and give our client the quality results they expected. Ki Pro Mini was a natural choice for the project.\"\\nAlmost the entire shoot was done handheld on Sony F3 cameras with the S-Log option, outfitted with RED 18-85mm zoom lenses. The HD-SDI output from the camera was fed to two AJA Ki Pro Minis recording at ProRes HQ. EBH was also able to leverage the output of the Ki Pro Minis to send matching timecode to all the other equipment on set, ensuring everything would remain in sync in post production. Once the footage was recorded, without having to spend additional time on ingest or transcoding, Ki Pro Mini provided edit-ready files that could be natively accessed in both Avid Media Composer and Apple Final Cut Pro.\\n\"This is one of the toughest productions we\\'ve ever undertaken, but throughout all of it, the Ki Pro Minis performed flawlessly. They were very reliable and allowed AKSON to capture the highest quality ProRes in the most undesirable of conditions - all while fitting within a tight budget,\" Kovcin concluded.',\n",

       " 'From: Puglia, Italy\\nVarietals: Mostly Negroamaro, blended with a small amount of Malvasia Nera\\nTasting Notes: The 2013 Copertino Riserva is a wine to savor. Its ruby red color with garnet highlights immediately captivates the eye. The nose reveals herb-tinged red and black fruit aromas that are complemented by savory herbs, tobacco leaf, and black pepper, giving the wine depth and complexity. On the palate, this Riserva is medium-to-full-bodied, featuring brambly raspberries, black cherries, and blackberries that interweave perfectly with the herbaceous notes, creating a well-structured and balanced wine. The moderate acidity uplifts the fruit characters and gives the wine a youthful kick, while firm yet pliant tannins complete the experience. This wine is a testament to the winemaker\\'s expertise, demonstrating the quality that can be achieved with careful winemaking and bottle aging.\\nCritical Acclaim: “An intriguing red that\\'s aging gracefully, with delicate notes of baked cherry and black fig fruit accented by dried thyme, incense and leather. Well-knit and focused, with light, silky tannins, this is still fresh thanks to its orange peel acidity and the tang of minerally iron and salt notes. Drink now through 2027.” –Wine Spectator, 90 points (2012 vintage review)\\nPairing: Perfect for just about any time of year, this 10 year old masterpiece really delivers. We dare say you’ll be wanting this when cooler weather hits, but it’s the perfect richly textured red wine that’ll warm you on cool summer evenings when you want to spend all the time outdoors in front of a fire. It is also the ideal companion for barbecue! If you’re vegetarian, we’d recommend Folami’s BBQ Tofu: a recipe from Folami Prescott-Adams, and adapted by Nicole Taylor for the NYT. If not, give Melissa Clark’s NYT recipe for Grilled Pork with Whole Spices and Garlic Bread a try.\\nLargely inspired by Puglia in the peninsula\\'s southernmost reaches, ancient Greeks called Italy \"Oenotria\" – land of the vine. Today, Puglia is home to 25 production zones, most significantly the DOC Copertino. The Copertino Cooperative was established in 1935 when a group of visionary growers collaborated to produce a higher-quality wine from the region\\'s traditional indigenous grapes.\\nSeverino Garofano, the talented winemaker behind this project, has been long regarded as the most respected enologist in the Salento. With Copertino, Garofano and his growers have been catalysts for the region\\'s pride in making modern varietal wines that stand on their own, rather than being used as simple blending resources.\\nNegroamaro has long been recognized as one of the grapes best suited to the hot, dry climate and terroir in the Salento peninsula (colloquially referred to as the \"heel\" of Italy\\'s \"boot\"). At ten years old, this wine’s age is certainly an asset; this time has allowed the Negroamaro’s tannins to sofen, and tertiary flavors to develop in the bottle.\\nPayment & Security\\nYour payment information is processed securely.

       " '“If people at home want to be able to keep watching the television, be able to turn the kettle on, and benefit from electricity, we have got to make these investments. It is essential to keep the lights on.”\\nEd Davey, energy secretary, 21 October 2013\\nThe deal was to build two reactors at Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset which would provide “a stable source of clean power from 2023, generating enough electricity to power nearly 6 millions homes”, according to a government press release.\\nEDF Energy will lead a consortium including Chinese investors, with an investment of around £16bn. The China General Nuclear Power Group and China National Nuclear Corporation will be minority investors. Ministers have agreed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour at the plant when it comes into operation.\\nThe Energy Secretary Ed Davey hailed it as a “historic day”. Due to the French investment, he said, “for the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer.”\\nEssential to stop us from from having no power, though? FactCheck wonders whether we’re being kept in the dark on this.\\nIt’s worth pointing out that it’s rather odd for the Lib Dem energy secretary to take this position. In their election manifesto, they said the party would would “reject a new generation of nuclear power stations. Based on the evidence nuclear is a far more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than promoting energy conservation and renewable energy.”\\nHe didn’t mention the manifesto this morning, though. At a press conference, he said that anyone who thought the power generated by Hinkley C could be generated by wind turbines was “brave”.\\nAs to his point that Hinkley C is the only way to keep the lights switched on – we’re not sure why the energy secretary says this.\\nAccording to Ofgem, which regulates the electricity and gas markets, the lights weren’t about to go out anyway.\\nIn a report published in June this year, Ofgem said that the energy capacity was due to hit its low in two or three years, and after that, things would get better.\\nCapacity margins could fall to between two to five per cent in 2015-16 – when they would “bottom out”. After that, Ofgem said, margins would begin to rise again, due to an increase in onshore and offshore wind generation, onshore.\\nIt’s also the case that according to the Department for Energy and Climate Change’s own assessments, demand for electricity has been falling.\\nHousehold electricity consumption has fallen by 11 per cent since 2005, and gas by 20 per cent since then. That’s due to improvements in home insulation efficiency, better gadgets such as televisions and electrical goods which use less electricity, and the recent economic climate.\\nIn other words, based on current trends, Hinkley is on schedule to begin operating when things are already on the up.\\nThe DECC report even said that innovations, for example more efficient boilers, home improvements enforced through tightened up building regulations, smart meters, and the government’s Green Deal, were expected to save households around 11 per cent – £166 – on their energy bills by 2020.\\nIn fact, when we asked Dr Paul Dorfman of the UCL Energy Institute what he made of what Mr Davey said, he said: “We would have to have a decade of huge growth to get back to the electricity demand of 2008.”\\nBased on what the regulator and the government have said, there hasn’t been evidence to suggest the lights are about to go out.\\nWe realise Mr Davey is speaking metaphorically – the National Grid would have to step in and introduce measures to prevent us all from sitting in the dark if we really were at that point.\\nBut it does strike us as odd that the plant wasn’t scheduled to be built before 2015-16 when we are likely to see the biggest squeeze.\\nSo we asked the Department for Energy and Climate Change what Mr Davey meant by what he said.\\nA spokeswoman said: “He was just making the point of how important it [nuclear] is. He wasn’t affirmatively saying that if Hinkley wasn’t built, the lights would be switched off.”\\nWe also asked for a detailed explanation and breakdown of how the government had concluded that a new nuclear fleet would cut bills by £77 by 2030. The claim was repeated a number of times, and we asked repeatedly how it was arrived at. Another academic, Professor Steve Thomas, of the University of Greenwich, told us: “The idea that we can know what the electricity supply will be in 17 years is laughable.”\\nWe were sent several reports of models and analysis, but no one was prepared to actually sit and show us some sums, saying simply that it was “complicated” and would be presented in due course.\\nIn other words, even DECC couldn’t shed any light on the matter, nuclear or not.',\n",

       " 'Charged With Auto Theft in Illinois? Here’s What You Should Do\\nWhen charged with auto theft in Illinois, you may find yourself facing felony-level penalties — up to 15 years imprisonment and fines capping at $100,000.\\nUnless you’re okay with more than a decade behind bars and fines that amount to financial ruin, it’s imperative you take any auto theft charge you face very seriously.\\nYour first step is to educate yourself about the laws surrounding auto theft in Illinois, and potential defenses against these charges. Then, find an attorney who can help you build the right defense for your case.\\nIn this post, we’ve provided a basic guide for what to do when charged with Illinois auto theft.\\nFirst, Find an Illinois Attorney with Auto Theft Experience\\nAuto theft is one of the most common property crimes in Illinois. Much like other types of property crime, there must be both action and intent. Professional legal consultation will allow you to better understand the law and how your situation fits.\\nIn order to secure an auto theft conviction against you, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you:\\n- Committed theft by exercising unauthorized control, using deception to gain control, or obtaining control of an auto you knew was stolen, and\\n- Intended to permanently deprive the owner of the auto\\nIf the prosecution is unable to prove these two things, the charges will either be dropped or reduced to a lesser charge. Joyriding is a good example.\\nNext, Build Your Defense against Illinois Auto Theft Charges\\nDefenses for auto theft focus on disproving one or both of the above elements. The right strategy will depend on the specifics of your case.\\nWhen you meet with your lawyer, you’ll have the opportunity to share every detail and circumstance surrounding your situation. Remember, client-attorney privilege allows you to be completely honest about what’s going on.\\nOnce a timeline has been established and the details filled in, you and your Chicago defense attorney will be able to begin building the best possible defense.\\nIn the meantime, we detail commonly applied approaches and the contexts under which they may be used.\\nLack of Evidence\\nThe prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the theft in question. Circumstantial evidence is not sufficient for a conviction.\\nIf your attorney feels that the evidence against you doesn’t conclusively prove that you committed this act, he or she may employ the lack of evidence defense.\\nClaim of Right or Ownership of Property\\nIf you’re able to establish that you had a good faith belief that the auto in question was yours, or that you had the authorization to use it, you may have an affirmative defense.\\nTypically, defendants are able to provide evidence supporting a good faith belief — a bill of sale or promissory note if claiming the car is theirs, or even something as brief as a text message granting permission can serve as proven authorization to use the vehicle.\\nLack of Intent to Permanently Deprive the Owner of the Car\\nAdditionally, it may be possible to prove that you did not intend to keep the auto, thus striking the element of intent to permanently deprive the owner of it.\\nSay you left the car parked in plain sight to be easily found and returned to its owner (instead of submerged in a pond, for example). A possible argument exists for lack of intention of actual theft.\\nSimilarly, returning the car to its owner is conclusive evidence you never intended to permanently take it. The incident could instead be joyriding, or criminal trespass to vehicles.\\nThe entrapment defense applies when you did commit auto theft, but were induced to do so by a third party specifically so that you would be prosecuted. They compelled you to commit a crime you wouldn’t otherwise commit.\\nIn any case, facing auto theft charges can mean playing with your life. If there’s no other lesson you take with you, it is that fighting back is a must. That and a skilled Chicago auto theft attorney will be able to determine the best possible course of action for your case.\\nAbout the Author:\\nAndrew M. Weisberg is a former felony prosecutor who now serves as a defense attorney in the greater Chicago area. He has extensive experience in handling all types of criminal cases, from sex offenses and domestic violence to retail theft-related crimes, murder, and drug crimes.',\n",
       " \"Subscribe to Spotify\\nIn this episode of The Inner Chief podcast, we speak to telecoms industry disruptor, Alex West, CEO of Swoop, on being the calm in the chaos, trust and vulnerability, and building a high-performing culture through metrics.\\nAlex is currently the CEO of Swoop, a telecommunications company backed by Andrew Forrest’s Tattarang, and which has had a stellar year, including listing on the ASX followed by six acquisitions.\\nAlex has been involved in around 50 company acquisitions while in senior roles with some of Australia’s leading telcos, including Superloop and PIPE Networks (now TPG), and has also raised more than $66 million in equity in his 20-year career.\\nHe cut his teeth as a graduate engineer at Telstra, before climbing the ranks to Chief Operating Officer at Vocus Group.\\nAlex holds a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from the University of Newcastle, and a Master of Engineering Management from the University of Technology, Sydney.\\nIn this episode we talk about:\\n- How remaining calm, even when things go wrong, is his superpower;\\n- The shift from executive to CEO when you’ve spent two decades in the same industry;\\n- Leading a high-performing team through trust and vulnerability; and\\n- Cultivating a strong company culture of using metrics and dashboards.\\nConnecting with Alex West\\nYou can connect with Alex via LinkedIn\\nBooks and resources\\n- Start with Why – by Simon Sinek\\n“Things will always go wrong; my engineering background taught me to remain calm, avoid blame and just work through the problem.”\\nOn early career lessons\\n- Telstra takes a lot of time to train their graduates and their new staff. They didn't actually expect anything from you in that first 12 to 24 months, they just wanted you to learn. You did odd jobs and filled in a lot of administrative tasks, but they weren't looking for you to be a proper engineer at any time at the beginning.\\n- Not a lot of companies have the time or the resources to do that. So you don't often get that level of training that you would get at a big company with resources and a lot of experience.\\nOn his superpower\\n- Remaining calm. Not everything goes well, things will break. Things will always go wrong, remaining calm when that happens avoiding blame and just working through the problem, which obviously comes from an operations and engineering background.\\n- If you're authentic, honest and calm, people will want to work with you again. So my actual superpower is convincing people to come work with me again. Some of the people that I'm currently working with in this company, I’ve worked with for 15 odd years at four different organisations, some worked with me previously in two or three different companies. And so we're coming back together and trying to build something that we can obviously all be proud of.\\nOn his most valuable learning experience\\n- I did a Master's course very early on in my career and there were some finance subjects in there that I just keep relying on. In engineering, you learn to build things and solve problems, you don't necessarily always understand the finances. So that Master’s course dumbed it right down and I was able to build from that throughout my career.\\n- As you move from Project Manager to Operations Manager to COO to CEO, understanding how to put financial statements together or understand and read financial statements when you're not from an accounting or finance background, becomes incredibly important. It's probably the one thing I think is missing from other executives (other than the CFO).\\nOn moving from COO to CEO\\n- Learning that I was either responsible for everything or responsible for nothing. As a Chief Operating Officer or an operations role, I was completely responsible for the operations of the business, making sure that we were delivering services and keeping customers connected and making sure everyone was happy.\\n- You move to CEO and you're responsible for that and the performance of the company, but there's nothing I can individually do to fix that. I have to rely very heavily on the team around me and make sure that they have all the things they need and all the knowledge and they're able to do it.\\n- How does the sales process work? How does marketing function? What are the things that I need to ask to make sure that my Chief Revenue Officer is doing to make sure that the operations managers can do what they need to do and so on.\\n- Effectively you're trying to get people to answer their own questions. No one's coming to an executive level with absolutely no idea. All I'm really trying to do is pull that out of them by asking, “What do you think you should do?”\\n- It’s a no-brainer, but the moment you get people to start talking and going through all their options, making sure that if they're looking at something from a cross-silo perspective is whether they have spoken to the other executives. I’m also reminding people to talk to each other, which is a key part of my job.\\nOn sagely mentor advice\\n- One of my mentors, Bevan Slattery, his view of the industry taught me to view big and work out a way to compete. And his view was simply to just go off and compete. You build the things that they're not doing despite the fact that they build some amazing infrastructure.\\n- He taught me, particularly in negotiation, to actually ask for what you want. Most people are afraid to say, “Can I have this?” or “I think we should do it this way.”\\n- How you ask is part of the negotiation style. But actually just ask for it, even when you think it's a crazy idea, because the worst thing that they can potentially say is no, but they might actually say yes, so you can benchmark conversations. But put that aside and just say, “We would like to do this” and off you go.\\nOn his number one interview question\\n- We were recently interviewing for a Head of People & Culture and my CFO, who was interviewing with me, asked a question about coming out of the pandemic, and how would the candidate get all the people back into the office. Now, what was interesting about the question was that it wasn't something we were looking to do and something we were potentially moving away from. That was the real trick of that question – seeing whether or not someone would have the convictions to stand up for what they actually believed in, not just, effectively mislead an interviewer.\\n- So my advice here is to ask something that you don't necessarily believe in to see whether or not people will actually tell you what you want to hear or actually tell you what they believe and what they think you should do to collaborate. Because I don't need seven people working for me that just agree with me, because that's a surefire way to put business into the toilet.\\nOn differentiating the business\\n- Listening to customers, making sure we're taking their feedback in adjusting our process. So one of the reasons why we choose to own our infrastructure and sell more on what we build, as opposed to what other people build, is we can control that.\\n- The main thing is making sure people are contactable. So, having local support centres. And it's not how long you spend on the call, it's whether you actually service the customer and fix what they need.\\n- And then building infrastructure to back that up. The best service is actually no service. Make sure that you can build a reliable network that hardly ever goes down. The less calls we get, the better.\\nOn building a high performing team\\n- You can't do it all yourself, but in terms of bringing a team together, trust and vulnerability are key. I know that I can't do everything and so I trust my team to do it and tell them that I trust them to do it. We have to rely on each other to actually achieve an outcome.\\n- We, as an executive or even as a company, succeed and fail and grow together. If one division's not doing what they need to do, then none of us will actually succeed. So it's helping each other, keeping each other accountable.\\n- And how do you drive that? You've got to know your numbers and keep people accountable for what they're doing. But also, encourage people to reach out and be vulnerable and say, “I don't know what I'm doing here.\\n- I often encourage my executive to look for mentors outside of the business to say, “Is there any coaching you need? Or is there someone on the board you can talk to?”\\n- You have to define what success looks like. So 12 to 12.5 in EBITDA is our key metric, so just making sure that we keep that as a focus and then working back from there.\\n- So, to achieve that metric, we need a certain revenue, and to get a certain revenue, we need a certain amount of sales at a certain gross margin. And so you just keep tracking that week on week. We get weekly dashboards, we know how many sales we did last week. We know how many connections we did. We know how many customer calls we had and just keep watching those for trends. What happened last week to what happened this week to what happened last month to what happened this month? Is it going a certain way? Is there a corrective action that we need to take? Is there something that's not working that we're trying? And then have a plan to, if this isn't going the direction we need to, what direction does it need to go?\\nOn the value of partnerships\\n- Whilst I said we're independent, we still sell products that other people build and manage processes on behalf of our customers, and that is part of why we're successful. And so our role is to support them delivering what we do, which is network infrastructure or deliver communications infrastructure so that they can add their products on top.\\n- That's a significant growth opportunity for us as 40 to 50% of our revenue comes from those wholesale partners, who actually own the end customer relationship, and we are just supporting them.\\nFinal message of wisdom and hope for future leaders\\n- Get the right team around you. People that you want to work with, people that you respect, and then motivate them to work together when you're not in the room. If you can do those two things, you'll ultimately be successful because you can't do it on your own.\\nMINI-MBA IN LEADING HIGH PERFORMANCE TEAMS\\nLimited spaces per intake\",\n",

They are also used in road tankers, for loose bulk substances, and in the agricultural and food industries. In the construction industry, they are used in irrigation and drainage systems.\\nStorz couplings are manufactured from brass and stainless steel. They are available in a wide variety of sizes, such as 44, 51, 81, and 66 mm. They are also available with blank caps to protect them from dirt and debris. They can also be pressurized. They have a bayonet locking head and a collar. They are rated for 150 to 250 psi operating pressure. They are also easy to assemble and disassemble.\\nThe Storz coupling locking head has two lugs on its swivel head. It can be used to secure any combination of fittings. It can be equipped with blanking caps and serrated hose tails. The locking head also has a maximum working pressure of 16 Bar.\\nStorz connections are standardized and available in a wide variety of sizes. They are most commonly used in flange connections. These are connected by bolting the flanges together with a gasket. The lugs and slots are then aligned, which means that the hooks of the opposing coupling must be inserted into the flange slot of the other coupling. The hooks then lock into place. The latches of the two couplings form a water-proof seal.\\nIn fire departments, Storz couplings are used to connect large diameter hydrants to fire sprinkler systems. They are also connected to water hydrants used as an alternative water supply. They can also be used to feed water into building standpipes.',\n",
       " 'One day, a sixth-grade student noticed a classmate cutting his arm with a small razor. Trying to do the right thing, she took it from him and threw it away. Surprisingly, instead of being commended for her act, she received a ten-day school suspension. Why? She briefly had the razor in her possession—something not allowed at school. Asked if she would do it again, she replied: “Even if I got in trouble, . . . I would do it again.” Just as this girl’s act of trying to do good got her into trouble at her school (her suspension was later reversed), Jesus’ act of kingdom intervention got Him into good trouble with religious leaders.\\nThe Pharisees interpreted Jesus’ healing a man with a deformed hand as a violation of their rules. Christ told them if God’s people were allowed to care for animals in dire situations on the Sabbath, “how much more valuable is a person than a sheep!” (Matthew 12:12). Because He’s Lord of the Sabbath, Jesus could regulate what is and isn’t permitted on it (vv. 6–8). Knowing that it would offend the religious leaders, He restored the man’s hand to wholeness anyway (vv. 13–14).\\nSometimes believers in Christ can get into “good trouble”—doing what’s honors Him but what might not make certain people happy—as they help others in need. When we do, as God guides us, we imitate Jesus and reveal that people are more important than rules and rituals.\\nSource: Our Daily Breat',\n",

       " 'Ever read a passage so good it gave you goosebumps? What is that word-magic that can transport a reader to another time, another place?\\nTwo readers kindly shared favorites from their memoirs with us, as examples. Here’s one I loved, from Dana Quinney’s second memoir, Wildflower Woman (and I bet you’ll love it, too!):\\nOnce in a while, a chilling sound would come drifting through the forest, soft and directionless as mist. A low, breathy sound like someone blowing across the neck of a bottle: ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh. When we heard this the small hairs would prickle at the backs of our necks and down our arms. This was the voice of a cassowary.\\nYou wanted to keep reading, right?\\nI could feel the damp, misty air of the forest. I could hear the deep, breathy sound. My nerves prickled at the hint of danger. I wanted to keep reading to find out what was happening. And what the heck was that dangerous critter?!\\nIt seems almost sacrilegious to dissect a passage so beautiful. But why is it that passages like this work so well? How do they hold the power to transport us to that place, to make us feel the author’s feelings?\\nHere’s another passage, this time from a memoir-in-progress by Candy Wafford:\\nI would love to say to you that I remember walking out of the bedroom, the way the carpet felt beneath my feet, that my hands grasped the wooden railing along the staircase. But I don’t remember those details. I just remember being in the hallway at the top of the stairs, alone, realizing it was true. Mama was gone. There’s no one to take care of me now.\\nThis example is compelling in a different way. For one thing, the writer is speaking directly to you, as if making you part of a conversation. For another, instead of sharing specific sights or sounds, she lets you share in a feeling – standing at the top of the stairs, shell-shocked and alone.\\nWriting Tips to Take Away:\\nSo, what’s the magic in passages like the ones shared above? And how can you add a dash of that special something to your own memoir? Here are four simple writing tips:\\n- Weave in the senses. Evoke images for your reader using sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. Just not all in the same paragraph, please! This particular dash of magic is best used sparingly.\\n- Let the shared experiences of life be a bridge to your reader. We’ve all heard the deep, resonant sound produced by blowing across the lip of a bottle. We’ve all had moments when outward details seem to vanish in the shock of unwelcome news. There’s magic in common, humble details and experiences we’ve all shared.\\n- Let less be more. Hinting at something can be far more compelling than stating a bare conclusion. In the passage above, for example, describing the small hairs prickling on your neck is a far more effective way to transport your reader to a moody place than saying, “I felt scared.”\\n- Sprinkle your work with short sentences. Try leavening longer passages with sentences of just three or four words. “Mama was gone” – how much stronger could that be?! Short sentences say to your reader: “This. This is important.” They give your reader’s eye a chance to pause, to rest. Most of all, they interrupt long, run-on thoughts that turn into wordy, descriptive passages that start to sound like lectures, which ultimately make your reader eager to stop reading and go rearrange their sock drawer. See what I mean?! Short is magic.\\nHere’s wishing you a magical holiday, filled with love, laughter, friends — and writing!\\nSuper thanks to Dana Quinney and Candy Wafford for sharing their memoirs-in-progress with us! I hope they’ll also come back and share the links when their new memoirs are done. You can already find Dana’s first memoir, Wildflower Girl, with our AmazonAssociates link: Amazon.com.',\n",

Never fear, there are several different routes that you can take to make sure your floors stay clean, dirt-free, and looking great!\\nThere are several different professional services that are great for cleaning grout and tile. Many of the carpet cleaners in your area will offer this service. Clean Green Solutions is one of them. We offer professional floor cleaning services and making a difference since we only use eco-friendly cleaning products.\\nThe key is to look for a service that will offer high-quality cleaning. The water will clean deep within the pores of the tile and grout to lift dirt and debris, and the vacuum function will remove them from the flooring completely. This type of deep cleaning does not harm your floors, and will not use any harmful chemicals that can be found in some traditional cleaners. Plus, by hiring a professional service to clean the tile and grout for you, you don’t have to deal with any of the hassles!\\nThere are some tips that you can keep in mind when you are cleaning your floors on your own. While it may not remove all of the dirt that a professional service could, but there are plenty of ways that you can make sure you are taking the best care of your tile and grout:\\n• Before mopping, sweeping, or vacuuming your floors is important to remove as much dirt as possible. The mop will then be able to lift and remove more dirt from the pores of the tile and grout.\\n• When mopping and cleaning, make sure to avoid harsh cleaners, like ammonia or anything with an ammonia base. These chemicals are able to remove or break down sealants that may be on your tile/grout and would do more harm to your floors.\\n• After mopping, rinse your floors. This will help to remove any and all residue that could be remaining from your cleaners.\\n• Use caution when moving furniture or heavy objects over tile and grout. Any scrapes or scratches that could result from moving furniture are openings that can easily trap dirt and dust, and result in some discoloration of your flooring.\\n• Avoid using wax on your tile floors. While it can give the tile a polished, clean look, the wax itself can discolor your tile.\\n• Make sure spills are cleaned up as quickly as possible in order to prevent discoloration from any possible chemicals in the spilled liquid.\\n• When cleaning your tile and grout, whether on your own or having a professional handle it for you, it is important to keep in mind which areas experience high traffic, as they will require more attention. Also, if you have pets or kids (or both!) more time may be needed to remove all set-in dirt and stains that may be trapped in the pores of your tile and grout.\\nWhether you are more into a DIY approach or would like to hand over the hassle to a professional, there are many options when it comes to keeping your tile and grout looking like new!\\nCall us today at (604) 644-8540 and get a free quote for professional floor cleaning services in Vancouver!',\n",

Henry has paid a soldier to save him a seat on the train, but to avoid trouble, he gives his seat to a captain. The train departs for the front.\\nThe last chapter in Book Two is short and remarkably unsentimental, considering that it marks the end of Lieutenant Henry and Catherine Barkley's idyll — and, for all we know, the end of their affair, as Henry is returning to the front. Hemingway resists the urge to milk melodrama from the lovers' goodbye, and this is consistent with the characters themselves and their stoic behavior up to this point. Notice that it continues to rain as they bid one another farewell. In fact, Catherine's last act in this part of the novel is to signal to Henry that he should step in out of the rain.\\nBrescia commune in Lombardy, north Italy, at the foot of the Alps.\",\n",

       " '2021 ANNUAL REPORT\\nCLINTON COUNTY SERVICES FOR THE HOMELESS\\nThe Clinton County Homeless Shelter held their annual board meeting via zoom on Wednesday, January 26, 2022. Board Members for 2022 include: Robyn Allen, Billie Baker, Becky Boris, Bill Davis, Pam George, Dan Mayo, Nancy McCormick, Renee Quallen, and Barbara Saville.\\nElection of officers approved for 2022 are as follows; President: Dan Mayo, Vice President: Bill Davis, Secretary: Becky Boris, Treasurer: Billie Baker, Assistant Treasurer: Pam George, Assistant Secretary: Barb Saville\\nThe following annual report was presented at the meeting by Denise Stryker, Executive Director:\\nIn 1988, the Clinton County Services for the Homeless, \"The Shelter\", opened its doors and became the first emergency shelter in a rural Ohio community! For more than thirty-three years now, the support of our Clinton County community has enabled the Shelter to continue its mission of providing emergency shelter, compassionate care and support to the homeless and underprivileged while remembering each resident is a person of worth.\\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors, staff and those living at the Shelter, continued following the guidelines and safety precautions established at the beginning of the Pandemic to help keep those working and living at the Shelter safe including limiting the number of residents to follow social distancing recommendations and keeping all communal area locations stocked with masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning products. I am grateful for the compassion and commitment of each Board Member, staff member and resident of the Shelter for their dedication and support of the work we are doing at the Clinton County Homeless Shelter.\\nFor those facing and experiencing homelessness during these unprecedented times, staying safe and healthy, keeping a positive outlook to find full-time sustainable employment that can support an individual and/or household is more challenging than usual. Those who are suffering from an addiction and/or mental health illness, being homeless or living in congregate locations are vulnerable and at a higher risk of contracting the virus. Additionally, loss of transportation, lack of affordable childcare, separation from a spouse, and illness/injuries are among some of the many other hardships that the homeless have.\\nEach year, it is heartwarming to see the outpouring of support from those living at the Shelter. This year was no exception with those living at the Shelter “paying it forward” and offering their support to answer phones, sort donations, help another resident with chores, offering their help for the staff and others living at the Shelter in need of encouragement or a smile. These acts of kindness give us hope and inspiration every day, and I am forever grateful for the lessons learned.\\nIn 2021, The Board of Realtors held their annual Day of Caring Pancake Breakfast in May. The fundraiser is usually held each February. The May event was quite successful, and we are looking forward to a Spring pancake fundraiser again this year.\\nShelter staff and Board Members organized a Drive-through Soup Fundraiser held in the Fall of 2021. The turnout was great, and we were able to see many of our soup fundraiser supporters who drove through for delicious homemade soups prepared by our phenomenal volunteers!\\nThe Wilmington Area Ministerial Association continues to support the Shelter along with local churches, businesses, service organizations and individuals. The Shelter also received help from community giving through funds awarded by the Clinton County United Way in 2021.\\nThe Shelter continued collaboration with the Cincinnati Food Bank in conjunction with the local Walmart store and the Feed America Program in 2021. Volunteers organize efforts to pick up the donated food and distribute it to the Shelter as well as other local organizations that help feed those in need. In 2021, two hundred seventy-six Clinton County households received help from the Shelter food pantry with aid from the Feed America Program and donations from individuals, churches, families, and businesses. Three days a week, volunteers deliver food from the Feed America Program to churches in surrounding Villages in Clinton County.\\nThe Shelter\\'s ability to help those in need depends on funding from various sources. The Ohio Development Services Agency Homeless Crisis Response Program (HCRP) emergency shelter grant supplies operating funds for the Shelter. Additionally, the Shelter collaborates with four surrounding counties operating as region 16 and receives funds from the Rapid Rehousing Program (HPRP) Grant. The goal of HPRP is to rapidly move families from emergency shelter into permanent housing. Mental Health and Recovery Services of Warren and Clinton Counties provided a 2021 fiscal year grant to the Shelter. This grant allowed the Shelter to provide essential services to those Shelter residents who were in recovery. In 2021, more funding sources were made available from the Homeless Crisis Response Program Cares grant to cover operating expenses, PPE, homeless prevention, and off-site housing.\\nThe Clinton County Homeless Shelter accepted the admin role in the Clinton County Coalition on Homelessness, established in January 2021.\\nA professional consultant was hired to help establish the Coalition and a coordinated community plan to prevent and end homelessness in Clinton County. The Coalition includes more than 70 members that meet quarterly and a steering committee that met bi-monthly in 2021.\\nThe Coalition approved the Coordinated Community Strategic Plan to prevent and end homelessness at their October 2021 quarterly meeting.\\nFour Coalition workgroups including temporary housing, service resources, prevention, and rehousing meet regularly and are using the Coordinated Community Plan to help those in our community who are experiencing homelessness and a housing crisis. Funding for the project was provided by the City of Wilmington, Clinton County Foundation-Legacy Funds and Health First.\\nThe Shelter\\'s nine volunteer board members held meetings via zoom each month to oversee operations and make important decisions on behalf of those we serve. The Shelter employs five full-time and three part-time staff members. In addition, previous and current residents of the Shelter \"pay it forward\" by sharing their time and talents to volunteer at fundraising events, to help maintain Shelter property, and to lend a hand wherever needed.\\nIn 2021 we provided a home for 148 people, including 25 children. Residents spent 6,361 total nights at the Shelter. During their stay, residents received a total of 31,805 meals and snacks. Clinton County is a wonderful place to live and work. The Shelter board and staff thank each of you for your continued support!\\nPlease call 937-382-7058 or email email@example.com if you would like more information about the shelter.

So how could you do that? The simplest solution is product photo retouching. So how retouching boosts online sales in the long term will be discussed in the content.\\nTo boost online sales, you should consider many things to make it happen. First, you have to offer users the best price, best product, and best shopping experience.\\n\"Always deliver more than expected.\"\\n- Larry Page, Co-founder, Google\\nYou can attract users to the online store by uploading high-quality product photos to let them know what\\nthey are buying.

So rather than\\ntelling buyers about your product, show eye-catchy product images. A blurry or low-quality image\\nis not appealing. Buyers want to see what they are buying in vivid detail – a low-quality and\\nthe blurry image will be terrible to attract viewers.\\nBeware of low-quality images since these discourage buyers from not only buying your stuff but\\nalso never come back to your store ever again. Product photo retouching services should be your\\nfirst choice of action to get stunning images.\\nThe priority of a webshop owner should represent the product image in its best look.\\nCustomers also want products to be authentically represented by accurate colors. Product image editing lets you make your products look genuine and authentic. The more time and effort you spend on your photos, the better the original vibe of the product will get.\\nNeed for Professional Retouching Services\\nIn e-commerce platforms, the single most important thing is the product photos. The math is simple – good product photos sell, and they sell pretty well.\\nThe first thing to do for stunning photographs is hiring a professional photographer who knows the ins and outs of excellent product photography. Photography alone, however, is not enough.\\nTo make product photos pop and come alive, you need professional retouching services.\\nPhotographers will do the shooting, compositing and ensure that the product is well-lit and under ideal conditions. Finally, the product photo retouching service edits the photo to make it desirable to the customers and suitable for viewing in e-commerce stores and other social media sites.\\nEvery ecommerce site has different image requirements. The same image cannot be used everywhere because several things may be different – starting with aspect ratios, minimum and maximum resolution requirements, product background requirements, and other miscellaneous requirements; the list goes on. This is why product image editing is so important – the right images need to be in the right places.\\nDifferent Types of Product Retouching\\nThere is no way you should use raw product photos from the photographer. The RAW images require much work\\nas it has too many imperfections.

       " 'Nov 23, 2021\\nChair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Pramila Jayapal celebrated Monday\\'s announcement from the U.S. Labor Department that all federal contract workers will be paid at least $15 per hour starting in January, but also took the opportunity to argue that should be the wage floor should for all U.S. workers.\\n\"Great news,\" tweeted Jayapal in response to the news. \"Now, let\\'s take this nationwide and give over 30 million workers a much-needed and well-deserved raise.\"\\nIn a statement on Monday, the Labor Department said the finalized rule--which will apply to all workers employed under or related to federal contracts--will go into effect on January 30, 2022 and is the culmination of an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in April of this year.\\nThe workers who will benefit from the new wage floor, said Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, \"do essential work on our nation\\'s behalf. They build and repair the federal infrastructure, clean and maintain our national parks, monuments and other federal facilities, care for our veterans, and ensure federal workers and military service members are provided with safe and nutritious food.\"\\n\\\\u201cI applaud the Biden admin for taking this critical step to raise the minimum wage for federal contract work to $15/hr.

Grijalva) 1637616021\\nThe federal rule will apply to an estimate 325,000 workers as new contracts are signed after January, though some working under existing contracts may not see that pay bump immediately. According to the Labor Department, the rule does the following:\\n- Increases the hourly minimum wage for workers performing work on or in connection with covered federal contracts to $15 beginning Jan. 30, 2022.\\n- Continues to index the federal contract minimum wage in future years to inflation.\\n- Eliminates the tipped minimum wage for federal contract employees by 2024.\\n- Ensures a $15 minimum wage for workers with disabilities performing work on or in connection with covered contracts.\\n- Restores minimum wage protections to outfitters and guides operating on federal lands.\\nWorkers represented by SEIU applauded the rule.\\n\"It would be such a relief to know that my job is protected because it would mean my family is protected too,\" said Ana Ayala, a single mother living in Woodbridge, Virginia who works as a janitor and is a member of 32BJ SEIU. \"In Virginia, most janitors don\\'t make this much or have these benefits which are so critical as a single mother with a child depending on me.\"\\nBen Zipperer, an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said in a lengthy blog post Monday that while the rule touches a relatively small percentage of the U.S. workforce, its impact could have positive reverberations.\\n\"While not a substitute for a universal $15 minimum wage, there may be important spillover effects,\" said Zipperer, noting that other private employees will likely raise their wages in order to compete for labor and that higher wages will lead to less turnover and higher-quality services in industries like nursing home care.\\n\"All in all this the new $15 minimum wage for federal contracts is excellent policy, another step to fixing a labor market that doesn\\'t deliver adequate wages,\" he said.\\nEarlier this year, the Senate Parliamentarian objected to inclusion of an amendment to raise the federal minimum wage for all U.S. workers to $15 an hour and progressives expressed outrage that the Biden administration did not do more to fight back in order to ensure that wages would be lifted for all.\\n\"At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage,\" Sanders, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said at the time\\nWe\\'re optimists who believe in the power of informed and engaged citizens to ignite and enact change to make the world a better place.\\nWe\\'re hundreds of thousands strong, but every single supporter counts.\\nYour contribution supports this new media model—free, independent, and dedicated to uncovering the truth.

       " 'Overwatch 2 Is Changing: Some of the Basic Modifications in the Upcoming Game\\nOverwatch 2 Is Changing\\nIf you have been following the news related to Overwatch, you are well aware of Overwatch 2 will be playable with no charge and will include a new hero. According to verifiable information, the launch date is on October 4 for PC and a variety of other platforms. Hopefully, it will be integrated into the version that is included in eSports competitions and betting sites here.\\nWe got the chance to play the game during the beta period, and it is safe to assume it will be fascinating. Although some gamers refer to the game as “Overwatch 1.5” since it appears to be very similar to the old one, this is not the situation. We now have access to new maps and we tell you that certain heroes have new capabilities and missions.\\nAlthough covering everything in one post may be difficult, we will do our best to present you with all the resources you require. Bear in mind that once the game is released, there may be some extra adjustments. After all, we still have a few months before it happens.\\nTable of Contents\\nMore Resilient Tanks, Faster DPS, and Passive Healing Supported\\nThe fact that DPS characters will be more rapid is among the first things you should know about Overwatch 2. Unless Blizzard makes a modification, every hero in this category should receive an increase of 10% in movement speed. This enables them to act more quickly and aggressively when necessary.\\nCertainly, Overwatch 2 cannot just give DPS characters bonuses because that would encourage everyone to play them. That is why Blizzard included a fantastic passive healing skill for healers that permits them to recover for 15 HP per second if they have not taken any damage in the previous two seconds. Some supporters will struggle to gain from this, yet heroes such as Ana will seem even more powerful as a result.\\nLast but not less importantly, tanks must be mentioned. Regardless of whether you choose D.Va, Rein, or whomever, every hero should have a knockback resistance of 30%. Furthermore, if these heroes are damaged, they will supply the enemy’s DPS and support less ultimate charge by 50%. The goal is to keep some heroes from using tanks to farm their ults.\\nBastion Is One of the Heroes with Loads of Changes\\nOverwatch 2 will feature new abilities for several of the heroes. There are a few major modifications, one of which is relevant to Bastion. He is an important character for novice Overwatch fans, although not being the greatest hero for the star players. Blizzard appears to be dissatisfied with Bastion’s current situation and the fact that he is not prominent in all brackets. As a result, Bastion in Overwatch 2 boasts a slew of new abilities.\\nTo begin with, Ironclad is no more a player in the game. This was Bastion’s passive ability, however, it was removed by Blizzard. Self-Repair and Configuration: Sentry and Tank are the same. “Configuration: Assault”, one of Bastion’s new abilities, allows him to transform into a tank. After that, he can only move at 35% of his normal speed and do 35% less damage. This ability currently has a cooldown of 12 seconds and a duration of 6 seconds.\\nThe A-36 Tactical Grenade is Bastion’s second new ability, and it allows him to deliver 130 damage. The ability has a minor knockback and can rebound off walls when utilized. When it comes to Bastion’s ultimate, they have a feature called Artillery. When activated, he can shoot three 200-damage rounds against a single target. As a result, his ult is one of the most effective weapons at killing a specific target.\\nDoomfist Has a Role of a Tank Now\\nBesides Bastion, who has a slew of new skills, Doomfist is also worth mentioning. This is one of the Overwatch characters who is known for his one-shooting powers. A competent player with Doomfist can make a huge impact in OW 2, and it appears that this will be the case again. Doomfist is no more a DPS as a result of this. He was, to be fair, one of several tankiest DPS heroes in OW, and he was frequently employed as an off-tank. This most likely influenced Blizzard’s decision to promote him to the tank.\\nDoomfist now has 450 HP instead of 250 because he has to absorb a lot of damage. He also no longer possesses his Rising Uppercut, which allowed him to flee trouble and land kills when the opportunity arose. Doomfist’s Rocket Punch can now deliver up to 30 damage, while the Wall Slam can now deal up to 40. To put it another way, he should not be able to land as many fatalities as he did previously. Seismic Slam and his ult, in addition to the ability described above, are unique. The first of his abilities allows him to propel himself into the air and then generate a shockwave when he lands. The latter deals 50 damage while also slowing the enemy’s range of motion by 30%. Meteor Strike, on the other hand, deals somewhat less damage and instead of knocking opponents back, slows them down by 50% for 2 seconds.\\nDoomfist also has a new Power Block ability. It allows him to block 90% of all incoming damage, as the name implies. Moreover, sustaining over 100 damage increases his Rocket Punch’s damage by 50%, increases its speed and range by 50%, and gives him a 1-second stun.\\nOrisa Is Potentially One of the Most Powerful Heroes\\nOrisa is the final hero we would want to discuss in this post. She, like Doomfirst and Bastion, has a slew of new skills. They appear to be planning to turn her into an attacking machine capable of destroying a large number of adversaries, rather than a tank that absorbs a lot of damage.\\nOrisa will not have Protective Barrier, Halt! or Supercharger in Overwatch 2. Her inherent armor is up to 25 and her HP is likewise 250, which is fortunate. The first of Orisa’s new abilities is Augmented Fusion Driver, which fires a massive projectile that shrinks as it travels. This is one of her damage sources, and it makes use of the overheat mechanic. This means that if she uses it too many times, it will become unavailable for three seconds.\\nOrisa’s access to extra ability in OW 2, Fortify, is granted. It will supply her with 120 Overhealth and will slow down her movement by 20%. Furthermore, the Augmented Fusion Driver’s overheating problem will be reduced by 50%.\\nEnergy Javelin is another intriguing talent that can aid Orisa. She tosses a Javelin that causes 80 damage, knocks the enemies back, and has a 0.2s buildup when used. If Orisa gets somebody with Javelin and the victim hits a wall, the target will take an extra 40 damage and be stunned for an additional 0.3 seconds. Javelin Spin is a skill that she utilizes to rotate this weaponry for 1.75 seconds, as the name implies. Orisa obtains a 60% mobility speed boost and destroys the enemy’s projectiles during this period. In addition to doing 90 damage, this ability also pushes foes.\\nFinally, Orisa possesses the Terra Surge ability. She can use this ultimate to draw foes close and Fortify them. Depending on the duration, this provides AoE harm for 4 seconds and up to 225 damage. Terra Surge treats with low DoT and slows the enemy’s range of motion by 30% while it is active.\\n2024 Digital Marketing Agencies Trends\\n2024 Digital Marketing Agencies Trends Marketing is an activity that requires a lot of efficiency and creativity.

       " 'As of October 2010, roughly 9% of Americans are unemployed. This is especially rough for those who are working on debt management. However, the following 2 months present an opportunity for many of those people. If it doesn’t pertain to shopping, lots of people get a little lazy around the holidays. That’s fine. I’m not here to judge. If National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation is on, you’ll find me on the couch too. Everyone can use some down time this time of year. However, if you’re unemployed and/or browsing for a new job, November and December are prime times for a job search.\\nA lot of people will take a break from their job search around the holidays, as they’ll be busy with family, travel, shopping, eating, etc. The thing is, the job openings are still there. This is an opportunity for the diligent to get a leg up. Use our tips below, stick to your search, and maybe you’ll land that new gig for 2011.\\nUpdate your resume. Add your current job and any new skills or accomplishments you’ve picked up. You can also keep several versions of your resume on file for different types of jobs. Maybe one has some info geared towards the financial industry, and another is more about customer service. Whatever you’re into. The point is if you’re applying for different jobs, make each application specific for that job. This goes for cover letters too. If it’s generic, then so are you.\\nIf you don’t have a profile already, get on it. Create your professional profile on LinkedIn.com. If you’ve already got a resume, then it’s simple enough to just transfer that info to the web. Regardless of whether or not you get a job or even an inquiry from LinkedIn, it’s still something you can point to as an online resume. Otherwise what will you do? Carry around hard copies of your resume everywhere you go? Here are some keys to using LinkedIn:\\n- Have a descriptive title for your profile. In a few keywords, it should describe who you are professionally and what kind of job you may want. For example: “Marketing coordinator with a flair for event planning.”\\n- Make connections with current and past employers and coworkers. These are the people who will build your online reputation.\\n- Write recommendations for people you’ve enjoyed working with. This shows your closeness with coworkers, and will prompt them to recommend you as well. You can also request recommendations from people you are close to.\\n- List accomplishments in your previous positions, not just responsibilities and tasks.\\n- Check out LinkedIn Answers and see if you can add to a conversation. As with any networking site, the more active you are, the more visible you are. Show your expertise.\\nAside from LinkedIn, manage your online presence responsibly. Do you have a Facebook profile? What about MySpace, YouTube, and Twitter? If you want all your friends to see you in your “sexy nurse” costume and the video of your longest keg-stand, that’s fine. Just be sure to adjust your privacy settings so that only friends can see them, not potential employers. It has become pretty standard for a hiring manager to do a little online research on an applicant. Google yourself and make sure nothing embarrassing comes up. If it does, get rid of it.\\nFor more tips on job searching, you can also check out our previous post: Laid-Off? Prepare for the Work Ahead.\\nOnline Job Listings:\\nOnce your resume is up to date, upload it to the job sites and start browsing. Start with Monster.com and Careerbuilder.com. Punch in all the criteria of the job you want, and see what comes up. With an account (which is free) you can also set up email alerts and saved searches, so the site will always know what type of job you’re looking for.\\nAnother great feature of these websites is the tips and tools they offer. They have advice on several topics you’ll encounter in a job search, like formatting and writing resumes and cover letters, preparing for interviews, workplace etiquette, salary negotiation, and more.\\nCheck company websites too. There are a lot of jobs that don’t get posted to to the popular job sites sites like Monster and Careerbuilder. If you’re interested in working for a particular company, check their website frequently for updated job listings. The company may have its own LinkedIn page too. You may also find other job websites that are geared towards your field of interest.\\nFace to Face Networking:\\nThe holidays are a time when you’ll probably be seeing a lot of friendly faces. Don’t be shy about telling people you’re in the market for a new job. Friends like to help. In fact, about 40% of job seekers say that they found their current job through a friend.\\nThese are all things that can be done easily during the holidays. If you’re at a party, network! Sitting home by the fire? Pour some eggnog, break out the resume, and let the editing begin! Done with your online shopping? Surf around the job boards!\\nNow is also the time to sign on for seasonal employment opportunities. Just about every store and business is going to hire additional help for the holiday season. Why not pick up a few hours a week for some extra cash? Employee discounts are also a big perk this time of year. Inquire within any business that interests you. This may not be a “career stepping stone” for you, but at least it gives you something to do, keeps you in the working mindset, and puts some money in your pocket.\\nAbove all stay positive, keep active, and enjoy your friends and family this holiday season.\\nIf you’re struggling to pay off debt, ACCC can help.

       " '2022 proved a tough year for investors as global macro events saw global bonds and equities down significantly. Globally inflation is on a downward trajectory and SA is likely to follow suit, with prevailing conditions supportive of a lower repo rate next year. SA’s position, however, remains precarious, with accelerated policy reform and private sector economic participation essential to achieve the growth needed.\\nThe Strategy’s performance as at 31 December 2022 is shown below:\\nThe combined effect of the Russia/Ukraine war, aggressive monetary policy normalisation and the lingering effects of Covid-19 yielded a bleak landscape for investors. This precipitated a fall of c. 18% in both global bonds and equities during the year.\\nSouth Africa (SA) fared relatively better than its counterparts during much of the year, despite the worst bout of loadshedding on record. December, however, brought fresh political concerns as the ‘Farmgate’ scandal threatened to derail President Ramaphosa’s presidency and his campaign for a second term as ANC president. Fixed income instruments recorded a torrid year, with the entire local asset class underperforming cash, which returned 4.82%, over the period. SA 10-year bonds closed the year at 10.86%, almost 100 basis points (bps) higher than the close at the end of 2021 and a level not seen since the onset of the Covid crisis in March 2020.\\nDespite a high starting yield, the FTSE/JSE All Bond Index (ALBI) generated a total return of 4.26%, which was not only below cash but also marginally behind inflation-linked bonds (ILBs), which delivered a total return of 4.54%. In dollars, the ALBI was down 2.38% in 2022, which is significantly better than global bonds, with the FTSE World Government Bond Index down 18.26%.\\nSouth African’s have been holding onto hope since President Ramaphosa took over the helm of the ANC in 2017 and the country in 2018. However, the pace of reform implementation has been disappointing and, if it were not for some very good luck over the last two years in the form of higher commodity prices and the restatement of GDP to a higher base, SA might well have found itself in a debt trap.\\nHANGING IN THE BALANCE\\nGovernment finances remain delicately placed as the primary balance is expected to stay in deficit until at least 2025/2026, reaching a debt load of c. 80% of GDP (refer figures 1 and 2). Financing costs remain well above nominal GDP and the only permanent solution is for the country to generate real economic growth of between 2.5% and 3.0%. That level of growth cannot be generated by government alone and reforms need to be accelerated to allow the private sector into the economy in a more meaningful way. In the energy sector, private generation can reduce the pressure on Eskom and increase the growth potential of the economy.\\nOther critical infrastructure such as roads, rail and water are in dire need of renewal and current government finances are not well placed for the magnitude of spending required. The private sector has the expertise, willingness and means to alleviate the pressure on government and increase employment opportunities in the economy through these projects. The ANC elective conference in December 2022 has bolstered the hold that President Ramaphosa and his allies have on the ruling party. Let this year’s hope be that the time for talking has passed and the time of doing is upon us or else the financial projections below could also become a mere hope.\\nINFLATION SET TO SUBSIDE\\nGlobal inflation and growth are widely expected to decelerate this year. US inflation, which was stubbornly high over 2022, is expected to average 4% this year from 8% in 2022. SA inflation should also follow a similar path and return to the midpoint of the band by the end of 2023 and is set to average 5.8% in 2023. The market’s expectation for the repo rate has also moderated, with a peak of 7.5% in the first quarter of 2023 (Q1-23), with no cuts priced until early 2024. However, SA growth is expected to decline from above 2% in 2022 to around 1% in 2023.\\nThe combination of decelerating global inflation, local inflation closer to the midpoint of the range in the fourth quarter of 2023 (Q4-23), and below-trend growth should, however, start to see expectations for a lower repo rate by the end of 2023. We view a normal repo rate in the range of 6.5%-7%, which implies the start of a gradual easing cycle in Q4-23. Despite this normalisation in front-end rate expectations, SA 10-year government bonds still trade at quite elevated levels. In addition, the implied credit spread for SA bonds still trades at around 50bps above their equivalently rated counterparts (Figure 3).\\nSA’S YIELD CURVE – A DIVERGENCE\\nThe SA yield curve remains an anomaly. Beside the fact that yields remain very elevated relative to cash, the SA yield curve remains among the steepest yield curves in the emerging market universe. A key reason for this is the fact that National Treasury continues to issue in the very long-end (>10 years) area of the curve due to the fear of being unable to roll over debt in the event of a crisis. The weighted average maturity of outstanding debt in SA remains among the longest in the world, at 11.34 years. This is significantly better than some developed market countries, such as the US, which has an average maturity of 6.04 years.\\nSpreads in SA remain very tight due to reduced issuance and an abundance of cash looking for a pickup relative to short rates. National Treasury did issue R50 billion of floating rate notes (FRN) in 2022 to supplement their issuance programme at levels of three-month Jibar + 130bps (currently trading in the market at three-month Jibar + 75bps). Even assuming cash stays at 7.5% and they are forced to issue at spreads of 130bps above cash, this still equates to a level of 8.8%, which is almost 2% lower than where the current 10-year bond trades. We would like to see more use of the FRN programme to substitute for current fixed rate issuance, which could reduce the pressure on the 10-year area of the yield curve.\\nWhen interrogating the ratio between the yields on various government bonds (five-, 10- and 15-year) relative to expected one-year forward cash rates, we observe that the ratio between five-year bonds and cash have returned to pre-Covid levels (Figure 4). However, 10- and 15-year bond ratios to cash remain elevated. Historically, 10-year bonds have generally traded at a 10% premium to the five-year ratio. Even if we assume that should now be double, given the deterioration in fiscal accounts, and assume cash in one years’ time will be at 7%, then 10-year bonds should trade somewhere in the range of 9.5%-10% (vs 10.86% at year-end).\\nThese two simple arguments on SA’s implied credit spread and the shape of the yield curve lead to the conclusion that SA 10-year bonds remain attractively priced and should trade in the range of 50bps to 100bps lower from a yield perspective.\\nSA CORPORATE CREDIT CURRENTLY UNATTRACTIVE\\nCorporate credit is an incredibly effective tool that can be used to enhance both the yield and longer-term performance of fixed income portfolios. However, it is important to understand that yield is earned over a multi-year investment horizon, and a long-term focus is essential when analysing and investing in the asset class.\\nThe SA credit market is more nuanced than international credit markets, with significantly lower issuance and hence much lower liquidity, making it predominantly ‘buy and hold’ in nature. This accentuates the need for the rigorous integration of credit quality and appropriate compensation in valuation for holding these instruments. In the years following the Global Financial Crisis, credit has been employed as a significant driver of fixed income portfolio returns, but the types of instruments employed have become more complex and less transparent with regards to the actual risk they carry. This requires investors to spend more time scrutinising not only the credit quality of their investments, but also the instruments through which they lend to these entities.\\nWe believe that the corporate credit spreads currently on offer are not attractive, and do not reflect their inherent risks. As such, we have been allocating away from credit and allowing our investment in credit to become less material in our portfolios for quite some time. However, with the recent repricing of global rates and credit markets, we believe these offer an attractive opportunity for investors.\\nThe local credit market has been influenced by a shortage in supply and an increase in demand for income assets. Issuance this year has been net negative, and according to data from the Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (ASISA), savings continue to accumulate. A supply/demand imbalance of this magnitude continues to distort fundamental credit pricing (see figures 5 and 6).\\nIn our view, SA government bonds (SAGBs) offer a much better allocation opportunity, albeit with more volatility. Figure 7 shows that over the last five years, fixed rate bonds have comfortably outperformed floating rate credit for investors who have been willing to stomach the additional volatility. Going forward, we still firmly believe this to be the case. If we look at the expected returns of a five-year government bond versus a five-year bank credit instrument set out in Figure 8, government bond yields would need to widen significantly (almost 2.3%) over the next three years to underperform.\\nOffshore credit is an asset class where we can achieve better returns for similarly priced risk. Figure 9 shows that better rated, international banks are trading at a wider credit spread relative to our domestic bank issuance. In a year where risk assets have been roiled by market turmoil, SA bank spreads have tightened.\\nLow levels of issuance and tightening spreads have created a guise of safety when it comes to investing in the local credit markets. We believe that allocating significant amounts of capital to the local credit market is unwise and would represent a substantial opportunity cost in the face of attractive valuations in other, more liquid asset classes. SAGBs, despite being more volatile, offer considerably better prospects over the longer term.\\nINFLATION LINKED BONDS – VALUE IN SHORTER DATED ILBS\\nILBs, like nominal bonds, continue to trade at elevated levels. One can attain returns of between 3%-4.5% after inflation when investing in the SA ILB market. In a world of cheap valuations, the limiting factor is cash and one has to be careful, as with credit, when assessing the relative attractiveness of the various asset classes. Although the real yields on offer are reasonably attractive, the required inflation for ILBs to outperform nominal bonds remains high, specifically for ILBs with maturities of greater than six to seven years (I2029) – see Figure 10. We therefore continue to favour ILBs with a maturity of less than seven years for allocation within a bond fund.\\nTHE YEAR AHEAD\\nThe global environment will remain in state of flux for at least the first half of 2023 as the battle between monetary policy normalisation, slowing global growth and sticky inflation continues to wage on. Risk sentiment has recovered slightly since the severe bout of risk aversion in the second half of 2022, but SA faces its own challenges – both politically and economically. Loadshedding, crumbling local infrastructure and souring local sentiment have precipitated the need for swifter reforms and increased private sector involvement. The valuation of SAGBs should continue to provide a reasonable buffer, since they trade at significant discount to fair value. We continue to advocate an overweight position in SAGBs, low or no allocation to corporate credit and believe short-dated ILBs still warrant a place in portfolios.',\n",

       " '“A Review of Lot and Home Size Minimums in Georgia”\\nBy Chris Denson and J. Thomas Perdue (Georgia Public Policy Foundation)\\nThe Council’s Synopsis\\nIn a study published by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, Chis Denson and J. Thomas Perdue analyze zoning laws and lot sizes in Georgia. Their methodology intends to highlight unnecessarily inflated restrictions for the development of single-family housing. They ask: which districts have notably high or low minimum lot requirements?\\nThis question is important to the rapidly growing population of Georgia and the Atlanta metropolitan region.\\nEconomics tells us that a low housing supply, especially alongside increasing demand, leads to less affordable housing prices. Supply in Georgia is primarily determined by local governments via zoning laws. If a lot or home size does not exceed a certain minimum square footage, then a local government will not issue a building permit for that property. By that logic, zoning limits on residential density are a primary driver of higher costs.\\nBased on their data, Denson and Perdue concluded that Georgia’s local governments do not habitually encourage low density. Many more cities and counties in Georgia have minimum lot requirements below the industry standard than above it. That being said, Denson and Perdue reiterate that “the lack of access and affordability is expected to remain an ongoing concern for a state that is estimated to be over 364,000 housing units short.”',\n",
       " 'A mortgage offer is a significant milestone in the journey towards homeownership. It signifies that a lender is willing to provide a mortgage loan, enabling the prospective homeowner to purchase a property. In the UK, understanding the timeline of a mortgage offer is crucial in order to avoid any hiccups in the home buying process. In this article, we will explore the duration of a mortgage offer in the UK, as well as factors that can impact its validity.\\nTypical duration of a mortgage offer in the UK\\nOn average, a mortgage offer in the UK remains valid for a period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the lender’s policies and the specifics of the mortgage product. This duration is determined by the lender and is usually stated clearly in the offer document. During this time, the borrower must complete the property purchase, or the offer will expire.\\nFactors that can impact the validity of a mortgage offer\\nChanges in personal circumstances: If the borrower experiences any significant changes in their financial or personal circumstances, such as job loss, salary reduction, or changes in credit score, the lender may reconsider the mortgage offer. In some cases, the lender may withdraw the offer or adjust the terms to reflect the borrower’s updated circumstances.\\nChanges in property valuation: If the property value has changed significantly since the mortgage offer was made, the lender may choose to reassess the terms of the offer. A decrease in property value could lead to a reduced loan amount, while an increase in value might result in more favourable terms for the borrower.\\nLender’s policy changes: Lenders may alter their policies or criteria for approving mortgages at any time. If a borrower’s offer is affected by such changes, the lender may need to re-evaluate the application or extend the offer’s validity period.\\nDelays in the home buying process: A mortgage offer can expire if there are delays in the property purchase process, such as slow conveyancing or issues with the chain of property transactions. In such cases, borrowers may need to request an extension from the lender, which may or may not be granted.\\nWhat to do If your mortgage offer expires\\nIf your offer expires before you can complete the property purchase, you have a few options:\\nRequest an extension: Reach out to your lender and request an extension of the offer. Depending on the lender’s policy and your circumstances, they may agree to extend the offer for a few weeks or even months.\\nReapply for a mortgage: If your offer has expired and an extension is not possible, you may need to reapply for a mortgage. Be aware that this may involve additional costs, such as application fees, and could potentially result in different terms and conditions for your new offer.\\nFind an alternative lender: If your current lender is unwilling to extend your offer, consider finding an alternative lender who may offer more favourable terms or a longer validity period.\\nIn the UK, a mortgage offer typically lasts between 3 and 6 months. However, the validity of the offer can be impacted by various factors, such as changes in personal circumstances, property valuation, or lender policies. It is essential for borrowers to be aware of the expiration date of their offer and to communicate with their lender in a timely manner if they foresee any delays in completing the property purchase.\\nGet a free initial consultation from an adviser.',\n",
       " 'Volcano Erupts for Third Time on Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland\\nIn a startling turn of events, a volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland has erupted for the third time since December. The eruption, which occurred on March 5, 2021, has brought forth lava fountains that reached an impressive height of 50 to 80 meters in certain areas. As a result, a volcanic plume rose approximately three kilometers above the fissure.\\nThis powerful eruption caused bright orange molten rock to spew from fissures in the ground, captivating both locals and tourists alike. The flow of lava even managed to cross a road near the famed Blue Lagoon, resulting in the temporary closure of the luxury geothermal spa. Visitors and staff members were evacuated for safety reasons, as the volcanic activity posed a significant threat.\\nAdditionally, the eruption led to a state of emergency being declared in the area. As the lava flowed over a pipe that carried geothermal water used to heat homes in the vicinity, it caused a burst. Consequently, more than 20,000 people were left without access to hot water, prompting authorities to take immediate action. The civil protection authority urged residents to conserve energy by limiting themselves to the use of one small electric heater per household to mitigate the risk of power outages.\\nThis eruption is significant in the sense that it sheds light on a new era of seismic activity in the region. The Reykjanes peninsula had previously not experienced an eruption in eight centuries prior to this event. The area’s dormant state since the 13th century had lulled locals into a sense of complacency, but the recent volcanic activity serves as a jarring reminder of the region’s latent power.\\nIceland, often referred to as the “Land of Fire and Ice,” is home to a staggering 33 active volcanic systems – the highest number in Europe. This is due to the country’s unique geographical position: it sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a crack in the ocean floor that separates tectonic plates. These plates continuously shift and collide, resulting in the frequent volcanic activity that Iceland is known for.\\nJust two months prior to this recent eruption, the Reykjanes peninsula witnessed another volcanic event in January 2021. Lasting around two days, that eruption prompted evacuations and caused damage to homes in the fishing town of Grindavik.\\nAs the situation unfolds, authorities and scientists continue to closely monitor the volcanic activity, ensuring the safety of residents and visitors alike. The eruption serves as a stark reminder of the untamed forces of nature that lie beneath our feet and the need for constant vigilance in areas prone to volcanic activity.\\n“Social media scholar.

       " 'Do school dress codes perpetuate sexism, culture of rape?\\nA growing movement argues that in attempting to create a conducive learning environment, dress codes value certain groups of people over others.\\nStudents at Boston Latin School, the oldest public school in the United States, have petitioned to have the dress code changed, claiming that it shamed girls’ bodies and perpetuated rape culture.\\nAs it stands, the school\\'s dress code bans see-through garments, spaghetti straps, hats, and gang-related colors. Leggings were recently removed from that list after a student-initiated Change.org petition put pressure on the school administration to work with the students to adjust a dress code they deemed was sexist and discriminated against minorities.\\n“The message I hope to send while we’re in here is that the business of education can coexist with a woman choosing what she wants to wear,” student Liliana Severin, who organized the Change.org petition, told CBS.\\nAfter negotiating with students, Boston Latin School’s interim headmaster Michael Contompasis has agreed to allow students to wear leggings and revisit some of the other complaints at a later date.\\n“We are very sensitive to the fact that we have kids here who are struggling with their own identity. We don’t want to create an environment where they feel uncomfortable,” Mr. Contompasis told the Boston Herald. “No one condones things that might be of serious consequence. We’re not picking on young women any more than we’re picking on young men.”\\nIn addition to protesting the school’s support of a ”patriarchal society where men can decide whether a female’s clothing is appropriate or inappropriate,” according to the petition, students are also worried that the vague phrasing of “gang related clothing” will disproportionately target the school’s minority community.\\nWhile school dress codes are nothing new, they got a boost in the past few decades as fear of gun violence in schools grew following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.\\n“Public schools have the responsibility to have safe and orderly schools that maintain an environment conducive to learning,” dress code proponent Dr. Larry Wilder wrote in a 2007 post, citing “benefits, such as decreasing violence and theft, preventing students from wearing gang-related colors to school, instilling student discipline, helping to resist peer pressure, helping students concentrate on academics, and aiding in recognition of intruders.”\\nBut recently, a growing movement has argued that in attempting to create a conducive learning environment, dress codes value certain groups of people over others.\\n“It\\'s not really the formal dress code by itself that is so discriminatory, it’s the message behind the dress code,” Maggie Sunseri, who produced \"Shame: A Documentary on School Dress Code,\" told The Atlantic. “My principal constantly says that the main reason for [it] is to create a ‘distraction-free learning zone’ for our male counterparts.”\\nDress code advocates note that boys wearing baggy pants, showing their underwear, can be a distraction in a classroom, too.\\nMany girls say that the implication of these dress codes is that schools are more concerned with the boys\\' learning environment than the girls\\'. A dress code protest in New Jersey spawned the hashtag #ImMoreThanADistraction, which went viral and created a platform for girls to air their grievances with being pulled out of class to change clothes so as not to distract the boys.\\nDress codes are typically divided along a gender binary, making it difficult for trans and gender non-conforming students. Additionally, hats and other head wear are often restricted by dress codes without taking into account religious minorities. Activists have complained that even when schools are working with cultural minorities and gender non-conforming students, the schools are making an exception rather than making acceptance the rule.\\nThe Boston Latin School Change.org petition, and many similar campaigns at other schools, have also criticized the school dress codes for making girls responsible for preventing harassment from boys – logic that, they argue, contributes to rape culture where victims are blamed for dressing provocatively.\\n“Often they report hearing phrases like, ‘boys will be boys,’ from teachers,” Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project, told The Atlantic. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”',\n",

Scott took the title and the name of its hero from the village of Ivinghoe, in East Buckinghamshire, England. Set in southern Yorkshire, north-west Leicestershire and northern Nottinghamshire in England. the story follows the Saxon protagonist, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart. Supporting characters include the legendary Robin Hood (appearing as the Earl of Locksley) and his cohorts Friar Tuck and Allan-a-Dale! This novel is also credited with popularizing the Scottish phrase \"caught red-handed\" which refers to someone caught in the act of committing some crime, and has its origins in bloody deeds such as poaching or murder! 📙 ✍️\\nAugust 15th is the birthday of famed novelist, Sir Walter Scott. There are several official tartans associated with this Scottish historical novelist, playwright and poet.\\nThe Ivanhoe tartan, by Carol A.L. Martin, was inspired \"by the novel by the same name by Sir Walter Scott about a knight in Saxon England in 1194 - a rather dark period of history.\"\\nIvanhoe is the story of one of the few remaining Saxon noble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelmingly Norman. It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of the Third Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured by Leopold of Austria on his return journey to England, was believed to be still in captivity.\\nInterestingly, the legendary Robin Hood, under the name of Locksley, is also a character in the story, as are his \"merry men\". The character that Scott gave to Robin Hood in Ivanhoe helped shape the modern notion of this figure as a cheery noble outlaw.\\nOther major characters include Ivanhoe\\'s intractable father, Cedric, one of the few remaining Saxon lords; various Knights Templar, most notable of which is Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Ivanhoe\\'s main rival; a number of clergymen; the loyal serfs Gurth the swineherd and the jester Wamba, whose observations punctuate much of the action; and the Jewish moneylender, Isaac of York (who is equally passionate about his people), and his beautiful daughter, Rebecca. The book was written and published during a period of increasing struggle for the emancipation of the Jews in England, and there are frequent references to injustices against them.\\nFor more about the novel, click the painting of \"The Queen of the Tournament: Ivanhoe\" by Frank William Warwick Topham (1838 - 1924).',\n",

       " 'Here’s a question for employee communicators: If companies with a laser focus on customer experience can outperform those that don’t, shouldn’t you focus your comms strictly through the experience lens of your customers — your employees? In 2017, Forrester found that customer-obsessed companies had the highest median three-year sales growth.\\nAs the head of content at a company that offers an omnichannel employee communications platform, I believe your communications strategy should be built around their needs first and foremost and should reach them on their preferred channels, wherever they work and with personalized information that’s relevant for them. It should help create purpose and meaning and should nurture culture and belonging.\\nBy now, there shouldn’t be any need to “sell” the importance of employee experience (EX). Just take one quote and one fact:\\n• McKinsey says employee experience is “essential for companies to compete effectively,” and\\n• IBM-WorkHuman research shows that even a small improvement in EX can have a significant impact on operating income. In one scenario, the operating income increase amounted to millions of dollars for a company with a sales revenue of $600 million.\\nThat’s from the company’s perspective. Employees? Employees today don’t always stick around if their workplace experience doesn’t match what they want. In my experience, culture and values are priorities, and how a company communicates, listens to and connects with its people goes a long way toward defining the employee experience.\\nWhat Employee Communicators Can Learn From Customer Experience\\nIt’s worth exploring how organizations can replicate long-established marketing approaches to successful customer experience (CX) and apply them to shape that all-important superior employee experience, particularly through their workplace communications.\\nIt doesn’t take much digging before one word leaps out: omnichannel.\\nThis is how John Bowden, former senior vice president of customer care at Time Warner Cable, describes it:\\n“Omni-channel … is viewing the experience through the eyes of your customer, orchestrating the customer experience across all channels so that it is seamless, integrated, and consistent.”\\nThis omnichannel strategic approach has been used to create successful customer experiences for decades. I’ve found that consumers expect a seamless and complementary experience every time they interact with a company or product.\\nSince employees enjoy this experience as consumers in their private lives, why should anybody be surprised when they expect and demand the same quality of experience at work?\\nWhat Does All This Mean For Employee Communications?\\nLet’s do a comms take on the Bowden definition above. It’s:\\n“Viewing your internal communications through the eyes of your employees, orchestrating their comms experience across all channels (email, mobile, digital signage, intranet and social) so that it is seamless, integrated and consistent.”\\nThis all sounds very reasonable and desirable, but how do you do it?\\nRegrettably, many organizations may not be able to achieve this as long as the’re using a multichannel strategy (which tends to involve siloed, individual and unconnected channels and technologies) instead of a fully integrated omnichannel approach to communication.\\nWhat Sets Omnichannel Comms Apart From Multichannel?\\nMcKinsey says employee experience “requires a human-centric approach,” and this gets to the heart of one of the most fundamental differences I’ve identified between omnichannel and multichannel communications.\\nWhen you adopt an omnichannel communication strategy, you view your employees as your customers — and you put them front and center at all stages of your internal comms process and thinking.\\nAnd you do it strategically in a seamlessly integrated way for a consistent experience.\\n“Seamless, integrated and consistent”: that’s what puts an omnichannel approach on a different level than siloed multichannel communications where — as far as the employee is concerned — frequently irrelevant information can be pushed to them on multiple channels in disconnected incoherence, creating distracting noise and comms overload.\\nOmnichannel comms are employee-centric: Content is personalized and employees can move between different channels that are specifically built to work together across email, mobile, digital signage, video and other mediums. There should be one content source for all channels, and communications should be adapted automatically and appropriately for each channel.\\nWhen companies do this, employees can enjoy a more seamless, consistent and integrated experience in whatever channel they interact with.\\nMultichannel communications, on the other hand, are channel-centric rather than employee-focused. They typically use siloed channels that are not built to integrate or work together. This can result in a disjointed experience for employees when they move from one channel to another.\\nTo create and implement an omnichannel communications strategy, you should:\\n• Audit your existing channels. Use a combination of quantitative (statistical analysis) and qualitative data (focus groups, interviews and observations) to find out what’s working and what’s not. Work with other departments, such as HR, to assess cross-organizational comms.\\n• Survey employees to determine their channel preferences (email, mobile, digital signage and team and social networks) and when they like to receive their comms.\\n• Create employee personas as a first step toward facilitating what I believe is the single most important focus of workplace communication today: information that is specifically targeted toward individuals or groups of people and is personalized for relevance. You should make sure your comms are aimed at a specific “somebody” rather than a generic “everybody.” This can encourage people to tune in to workplace communications instead of tuning out.\\n• Measure your comms performance engagement and effectiveness across all channels through unified omnichannel analytics.\\nBecause of the employee-centric mindset that underpins an omnichannel strategy — and the fully integrated technical infrastructure required to support it — the focus on personalizing communication can help increase content relevance for employees, reducing distracting noise and information overload.\\nIn contrast, one-size-fits-all multichannel comms in which the same content is published in the same way on all channels may have less personal relevance and risks causing some people to tune out.\\nWhen you follow the steps above, you can not only facilitate an employee-centric approach to what you do but also encourage your people to engage with your comms when it best suits them on their preferred channel — which can ultimately help support the superior employee experience that contributes to a company’s success.',\n",
       " \"You’ve probably heard of named drivers, especially concerning reducing the cost of young driver car insurance. But what exactly is a named driver, and how can having one change your insurance premium?\\nLet’s get into it 👇\\nSometimes known as an additional driver, a named driver is a person who is covered by an insurance policy to drive a car which has a different main driver. Both drivers receive the same level of cover, and if you are looking for cheaper car insurance, having one can lower your premiums.\\nBut what’s the difference between a named driver, main driver, and registered keeper? Let’s break things down further.\\nThe named driver is an additional driver listed on the insurance policy. Depending on the provider, there can be several named drivers. For example, if you’re a young person, you can add more experienced drivers, such as your mum and dad, to your policy as named drivers.\\nThe main driver is the person who drives the car the most. It cannot be the same individual as the named driver, but doesn’t have to be the policy holder.\\nThe registered keeper is responsible for ensuring the MOT is valid and the vehicle is taxed and insured. The keeper is also held accountable if there are parking fines or speeding violations.\\nHow does a named driver impact the named driver’s insurance?\\nThe named driver’s own car insurance is unaffected by them appearing as an additional driver on another policy - the two are considered separate.\\nHowever, if they have an accident in the main driver’s car, the main driver is held accountable, even if they weren’t in the vehicle. So choose your named driver carefully!\\nHow does it impact the main driver’s insurance?\\nAdding a named driver to your insurance can be a good idea for young or new drivers.\\nInsurance providers often see young drivers as riskier to insure than older, more experienced ones. Therefore, the insurance cost is usually higher. By including a named driver, especially a parent or older sibling, providers consider the risk lessened, and as a result, the cost is often lower.\\nThe reverse is also true, however. If you are an experienced driver and add a more novice driver to your policy, you may see your premium increase in price due to the perceived risk.\\nIt’s worth reiterating what happens if an accident occurs when the named driver is behind the wheel. The main driver is considered at fault, even if the additional person is the only one in the car. This can have a negative impact on their own no claims bonus and may increase the cost of insuring their vehicle.\\nFronting is the practice of claiming that you are the main driver of a vehicle when someone else is actually the prime user. It’s considered insurance fraud and against the law, carrying severe consequences.\\nWell-meaning parents will often try to reduce the vehicle insurance costs for their children by claiming that they are the main driver, when, in reality, their son or daughter uses the car the most.\\nIf you’re caught fronting, your insurance policy will become invalid, and you can find yourself prosecuted for fraud. You also risk getting fined, points on your licence and being unable to find a provider willing to insure you in the future. It can even affect your ability to obtain credit moving forward.\\n(PS - we've written a separate guide on insurance fraud.)\\nHow many named drivers can you have?\\nThe rules on the number of named drivers vary between insurance providers, but most will allow three or four additional drivers on your policy.\\nCan you get a no claims bonus as a named driver?\\nThe named driver cannot accrue any claims bonus on the policy they are an additional driver on. However, if they are declared the main driver on their own vehicle’s insurance, their no claims bonus can accumulate. Some insurance providers offer a discount to named drivers on the understanding that they take out their own policy at a later date.\\nCan I be a named driver of two cars?\\nYou are permitted to appear as a named driver for two cars, but insurance providers may question it, concerned that you may be fronting.\\nDo named drivers have fully comprehensive insurance?\\nThe named driver on your insurance policy will have the same level of cover as the main driver. So if you have fully comprehensive insurance as the vehicle’s usual driver, your named driver will enjoy the same level of cover. They will also benefit from any optional extras you’ve added to your policy, such as breakdown or key cover.\\nDoes the named driver get my insurance extras?\\nJust as your named driver receives the same insurance cover as you, they are also covered by any extras you’ve added to the policy. These can include windscreen or breakdown cover, or legal protection.\\nCan a named driver drive abroad?\\nYes, your named driver can drive your car abroad. Some providers will also temporarily allow you to add a driver to your insurance policy, so if you’re planning a long trip by car, this might be worth considering.\\n*Don't forget: if you're a provisional driver, taking on temporary insurance rather than being added as a named driver could be simpler and cheaper. We've put together a separate guide on the cost of learning to drive here, with some extra info in the table below.\",\n",
       " 'Never before translated into English, these two massive volumes narrate the exciting story of the amazing spiritual transformation that affected Wales between the years 1735 and 1850. Of great value is the use the authors make of eye-witness accounts preserved in contemporary diaries, journals and letters. A truly exhilarating read!\\nThese stimulating and enjoyable volumes narrate the exciting story of how Wales was spiritually transformed and the men whom God used to accomplish that great work. ‘The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it’ (Psa. 68:11). In this first volume, which focuses on the revivals experienced in South Wales, we meet the well-known figures of Daniel Rowland, Howell Harris, William Williams of Pantycelyn; but within these wonderful pages are portraits of many lesser-known preachers such as Griffith Jones of Llanddowror, Howell Davies, Peter Williams, and David Jones of Llan-gan.\\nWhat soon becomes evident in reading this fascinating history is the power of the Holy Spirit over congregations. From small beginnings in homes and farmhouses to great open-air gatherings of many thousands, the sermon became the foremost influence in the life of the nation. Whole neighbourhoods were turned upside-down and whole towns were subdued by the sense of God’s presence. The greatest concern of all at that time was the state of one’s soul before God.\\nThe great value of these volumes is the way they take up the words of those most involved in these remarkable events. In journals, diaries, letters and Association minutes they describe a wide range of Christian experience – conviction, repentance, faith and assurance, joy in the Holy Spirit, witness and testimony, conflict with sin and backsliding, restoration and perseverance – all are encountered and described with transparent honesty and humility. Preachers will also greatly value the many experiences here recounted in the work of preaching the gospel – above all the ‘demonstration of the Spirit and power’.\\n- 1,552 pages\\n- May 31, 2008',\n",

       " 'The 2020 season is behind us, and now it’s time to start thinking about what changes are coming in the offseason to prepare for next year. We will focus on the roster, examining the salary cap situation, looking at who’s still under contract vs. a free agent, and exploring potential options for freeing up money.\\nSalary Cap Situation\\nThe 2021 salary cap is currently projected to be somewhere between $175 and $195 million. I’ll use $185 million, right in the middle of that, as our estimate for now. As you can see in the table below, the Bears are fairly tight up against the cap right now (bottom row). All numbers come from Over the Cap.\\nThe Bears have very little cap room, and it’s worth noting this is with only 45 players under contract. The Bears will have to fill to 53 for a full roster, and the NFL minimum salary is $660k. Even if they fill out with minimum-salary players, that adds another $5.3 million, which puts them over the salary cap (or very close to it, depending on where exactly it ends up). That’s not to mention their draft picks, which will add a few million to that; the Bears pick 20th in round 1, and last years’ 20th overall pick had a $2.4M cap hit.\\nI’ll note these numbers are current as of about 10 PM Chicago time on Wednesday, January 13. They might have changed if the Bears sign more practice squad players to futures contracts (which basically adds in guys at that minimum $660k level).\\nSo the Bears are currently a little over the salary cap, though there are always options to free up more money (more on that later). Who do they have under contract making all that money? The table below shows the current depth chart for all 45 players currently signed for 2021 (again, might be a little out of date as the Bears sign their practice squad players in the upcoming days).\\nThat roster has a lot of holes on it. The QB and WR groups are terrible, as is safety outside of Eddie Jackson. There’s no depth pretty much anywhere, and they don’t have a kicker or punter signed. There is no realistic way they can fill all of those holes with minimum-level signings, so some money will have to be created (again, more on that later).\\nKey Free Agents\\nNow let’s look at what in-house players the Bears are at risk of losing this offseason. You can see a full list here, but the most important ones are listed below, along with some thoughts about how expensive they might be:\\n- WR Allen Robinson: He’s reportedly looking for a deal in the $18M/year range. Spotrac has given him a market value of $19.9M/year.\\n- QB Mitchell Trubisky: Spotrac estimates he’s looking at a top-level backup deal of around $8M/year.\\n- OL Germain Ifedi and Alex Bars: Ifedi was a minimum-level signing last year, and is probably looking at something similar this go around, though it wouldn’t be a shock if that salary bumps up to $1.5-2M after he had a relatively solid season. Bars is an exclusive rights free agent, which means he’ll be back in Chicago on a minimum level deal.\\n- KR/RB/ST ace Cordarrelle Patterson: His last deal paid him just over $4.5M/year, and I doubt he’ll be looking for a pay cut after back-to-back 1st team All Pro nods as a kick returner.\\n- DL Roy Robertson-Harris, Mario Edwards, Brent Urban, and John Jenkins: This is the entire backup group for Chicago’s defensive line, and they combined for 1092 snaps in 2020 after Eddie Goldman opted out. I don’t imagine any of them will be expensive to keep around (unless somebody else pays RRH coming off of an injury), and they all played pretty well.\\n- S Tashaun Gipson, Deon Bush, and DeAndre Houston-Carson: These are the only safeties besides Eddie Jackson to see the field in 2020, and Bush/Houston-Carson are core special teamers too. None of them should be expensive, but the Bears could look to replace Gipson with another cheap starter.\\n- OLB Barkevious Mingo: Mingo was another minimum-level depth signing who performed quite well for Chicago in 389 defensive snaps in 2020. He also played a big role on special teams, playing over 80% of the snaps there. He could make sense to bring back, but might require a small pay raise.\\n- K Cairo Santos: Santos was a minimum-level signing who is likely looking for a big deal after a great 2020 season. For a kicker, that’s probably something in the neighborhood of $4M/year.\\n- P Pat O’Donnell: O’Donnell’s last deal paid him $1.75M/year, and he’s probably looking to repeat or slightly improve on that after 2 solid seasons.\\nWays to Create Cap Space\\nSo that’s where things currently are for the Bears: they have no cap room and a few key free agents who need to be re-signed or replaced with money they don’t currently have to spend.\\nThe good news in the NFL is that the salary cap is fluid, and there are always ways to shift money to the future (as Ryan Pace pointed out in his press conference yesterday) or get out from under some contracts. Let’s look at options they have to create cap room in 2021.\\nThe table below is a complete list of every player they can cut to free up at least $1.5M in 2021 space. I will note I am not advocating for all of these players to be cut, but simply trying to provide a complete picture of their options to create much-needed cap space this offseason.\\nA few thoughts:\\n- I’ll start with the 2 biggest names/salaries on here: Kyle Fuller and Akiem Hicks. Cutting either player doesn’t make much sense to me. More realistic options will be discussed in the extensions or trades section below.\\n- Jimmy Graham and Buster Skrine are easy players to cut and free up close to $10M.\\n- I figure one of the tackles – Massie and Leno – are likely gone, but replacing those players in free agency will be more expensive than the money saved if you want anybody remotely competent, and you can’t count on two rookie tackles starting, so they’re probably keeping one of them (I would guess Leno stays).\\n- Those three cuts would open up about $15M in space for the Bears, which probably gives them the breathing room they need to sign their draft class and fill out the roster with small signings (minimum salary or slightly higher).\\n- The Bears, unfortunately, can’t get out of the 3 contracts they would most like to: Nick Foles, Robert Quinn, and Danny Trevathan. All would have higher cap hits if they are cut than if they remain on the roster.\\nExtensions or Trades:\\nAkiem Hicks and Kyle Fuller both have contracts that expire after 2021, meaning the Bears could easily do a back-loaded extension to lower their 2021 cap hit. This is especially true for Kyle Fuller, who has a $20M 2021 cap hit and could cut that in half (saving $10M) with an extension. The same could be said for Hicks, though they likely wouldn’t save more than $3-4M of his $12M 2021 cap hit with an extension.\\nIt should be noted, however, that there is no free lunch. A back-loaded extension, which pays the player money upfront but doesn’t count it on the cap until later, can create space now, but teams will pay for that at a later date. I would argue it doesn’t make much sense for the Bears to borrow future cap dollars to pay for a current roster that is clearly not winning a Super Bowl.\\nWith that in mind, the Bears could look to trade Fuller and/or Hicks to free up the same money as if they cut them ($11M for Fuller, $10.5M for Hicks). This would likely be an unpopular move, and would certainly make the Bears worse in 2021, but I believe it is in their best interests overall, as I explained in depth a few weeks ago.\\nThe final option to create 2021 cap room is by restructuring a player’s contract. This is usually for contracts with large salaries, as teams can convert the salary to a bonus. Then the player gets the same money as they would have anyway, but the cap hits for it spread out over multiple seasons. As with a back-loaded extension, this is good for now but bad for later.\\nThe Bears could do this with Khalil Mack ($17M salary), Robert Quinn ($11.5M salary), or Eddie Jackson ($9M salary). You can spread that salary out over 5 years of cap hits, so basically make 80% of it disappear this year, which means they could save up to $13.6M with Mack, $9.2M with Quinn, and $7.2M with Jackson. But again, I want to caution that this hurts the future salary cap; this moves money to the future, it does not make it disappear. It is not really a move that makes much sense when a team is not currently a strong Super Bowl contender.\\nTo recap where we are right now:\\n- The Bears are currently slightly over the cap for next year when you consider them filling in their roster with draft picks and minimum-salary players.\\n- They have a few free agents slated to sign deals well above league minimum, most notably Allen Robinson.\\n- Due to this, they need to create salary cap room, but can’t really get out of the worst contracts on their books.\\nIf that sounds awfully bleak, it is. With no QB, no salary cap space, and no easy options to create a bunch of it, Chicago is in a really bad spot this offseason, which I already pointed out before the 2020 season started. With that said, they have three options for how to approach the offseason:\\n- Tank. One of Chicago’s problems is that they’re too good to get a high draft pick (and thus a premium QB prospect). That can easily be fixed this offseason. Trade everybody with value, which includes Akiem Hicks, Kyle Fuller, Khalil Mack, and Allen Robinson (via a tag and trade approach). Sign nothing but minimum-level, 1 year deals in free agency this year to maximize whatever compensatory picks you might get for somebody like Cordarrelle Patterson (or Robinson if they can’t tag him). Use the draft (with many extra picks scattered throughout days 2 and 3 from the trades listed above) to build up the offense around the QB as much as you can (OL/WR/TE), lose a bunch of games with Nick Foles next year, draft your QB in 2022, and have a bunch of money to spend on the roster around him.\\n- Live Within Your Means. Make the obvious cuts of Skrine, Graham, and Massie. Either keep Fuller and Hicks and let Robinson walk, or trade at least one of Fuller and Hicks and use that money to re-sign Robinson. Fill out the rest of your roster with mostly minimum-level free agents and draft picks. Try to get a QB in the draft to compete with Foles. Understand you are not winning a Super Bowl in 2021, but remain competitive while getting your cap situation to a healthy spot and having a realistic turnaround to a playoff team in 2022.\\n- Stay Aggressive. This would basically be repeating Ryan Pace’s 2020 offseason strategy. Move money to the future with back-loaded extensions for Fuller and Hicks, move money from Mack, Quinn, and/or Jackson to the future via restructures, tag Allen Robinson or sign him to a back-loaded extension, and use free agency to aggressively fill holes with back-loaded contracts. This gives you the best 2021 team (that is still not a serious Super Bowl contender) but continues to damage your future.\\nI really don’t care if the Bears choose option 1 or 2 this offseason – reasonable arguments can be made for both approaches – but they cannot afford to do option 3 again. That’s what they did last offseason, and it basically cost them 2 years (2020 and 2021). Doing it again will likely ruin any chance they have at seriously competing in 2022 or 2023.\\nUPDATE: I wrote all this without knowing what would happen with Ryan Pace. Yesterday’s press conference all but announced that option #3 is what is happening this offseason. This is very bad news for the Bears’ long-term prospects. My fear is that the 2021 offseason will double down on last years’ mistakes to set this franchise back for years to come.',\n",

       " 'Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones joined “Shan & RJ” on 105.3 The Fan [KRLD-FM] on Friday to talk about Thursday’s season-opening loss to the Buccaneers. Here are some highlights, edited for clarity:\\nOn his reaction to Thursday night’s loss in Tampa...\\nJones: “That was opening night. We were playing the world champs. But what an opportunity for a victory against, again, David and Goliath. We played well. ... What I see is a defense that is going to get better. We have the athletes to get better. We have the scheme to get better. We were playing quality competition. I was really proud to see the good things that occurred during the ballgame. ... We’ve got some guys that weren’t out there that could help us out. We can get better. That, hopefully, will mitigate what happened to us right there at the end of the game on the last drive when you certainly need to make a play to win that ballgame.\\n“I felt like that we paid the price of not really having our kicker during training camp, and I look back, and when you don’t have a kicker that is real active during training camp, you may be kidding yourself for the early ballgames. Is he really ready to go? The loss isn’t to be blamed on the kicker, but still, if we would have had some execution on three or four of those kicks, it might have made a big difference here.\\n“Offensively, we’re really, in my mind, really what I thought we could be. The two key standouts for me were the offensive line and the defensive front relative to the running game, those two. The big boys played a hell of a game last night.”\\nDo you still believe in Greg Zuerlein as the kicker of this team?\\nJones: “Yeah. Yes. And I said he’s, again, do you go into the season with a kicker that’s been on kind of IR and been easing along maybe when it’s that vital to have really been in the swing of things? Do you go with a kicker that didn’t do much during the preseason relative to competition that spent a lot of time, which they can, out on the practice field and working the art that way? Yes. We did, and I think we paid a price there in this first opening game. I believe in him long-term and I believe he’ll play better as we get into the season.”\\nDid you like Dak Prescott telling Tom Brady “we’ll see you again” on the field after the game?\\nJones: “Oh, man, I do. If you want to smile about something that has a big-,time, long-term relative to the season impact on it is Dak. It’s one of the most phenomenal performances I’ve seen because he really hadn’t played in almost [a year]. And for him to step out there and have that kind of night is nothing but encouraging.”\\nOn kicking a field goal with 1:24 left on the clock and giving the ball back to Brady...\\nJones: “We left him too much time. You can’t do that in our game. You can’t leave a quarterback of his caliber — you just can’t do it. You put yourself into a spot where you have to have a big play. One of the biggest plays of the night you have to have during that drive. And that’s hard to do against a quality quarterback. Everybody is pretty tired out there. Our defense really held up well, I thought. I really did. I thought [the Bucs] might have gotten a little tired, and that was going to be an advantage for us as we got down there at the end of the game. But you give -- with a minute and a half left on the clock, and your timeouts -- you give your quarterback, most of them in the NFL and they’ll take it down on you. So, you got to have a big play. We got a young team that is so talented on defense that we can get a big play in those situations. And we had a couple of opportunities.”\\nOn differences between watching this team vs. last season’s team...\\nJones: “I expected our offensive line to play last year the way it played last night, and it played — that was a big expectation. I didn’t know that we were going to be as inept against the running game last year on our defense, but last night we were not. And, so, but the difference in these teams, especially on the defensive side of the ball ... it’s upside for this team. We’ve got guys that even weren’t on the field last night that can make this defense better.”\\nWhich guys are you talking about?\\nJones: “I’m talking in the interior, [Neville] Gallimore. Talking [Kelvin Joseph]. ... I’m talking about [Malik] Hooker. I’m talking about the maturation of those young guys that are in there. Micah [Parsons] was close last night on a few things. He’ll get there on some inevitably. And then I’m also talking about this young group. When you’re a young player and you actually get those snaps, you grow right before everybody’s eyes. You grow. The problem is the price you pay as you’re growing. These young guys are going to do that for us, and then this scheme is going to become even more doable for these guys because they’re going to have more time in it. We’ve got upside, serious upside, on the defense. It’s the best thing, or one of the very best things that if you had to have a positive that you could come out with, we’re going to get better defensively and we didn’t play bad against a good team last night.”\\nMore from Cowboys-Buccaneers',\n",

       " 'It’s Christmas week, and I know how exciting and fun the holidays can be—-and also how difficult, lonely, and challenging they can be. No one to be with, not enough money, alone in a new city, or at home with a family you don’t get along with, or in the midst of a divorce, just after a break up, or after you lose a loved one. The holidays are not as easy and simple as they look on Christmas cards, or in the movies. It’s a time when we are acutely aware of whatever is missing in our lives, or whatever is difficult. I’ve had my share of difficult Christmases too, a long time ago, when I was divorced, and barely three months after my son Nick died at 19. That was a brutal year. Oddly, I worked harder on making Christmas special for my family in the hard years, than in the easy ones. And sometimes those Christmases turned out the best—the ones I expected to be terrible, and then they weren’t. Trying to cheer up my children after Nick died, I gave a skating party that year for my friends and their children. It didn’t bring Nick back, but it was a warm, loving event that became a tradition we loved every year, until all my kids left for college and everyone else’s kids grew up too, and we stopped doing it. But it was a lovely time of families joining each other during the holidays. We’ve all had our tough years, they’re part of life.\\nWe’ve always been about twenty or more, at our holiday table, for dinner on Christmas eve, they’ve always been loud, happy, fun events, with a visit from Santa during dinner. it’s a grown up, dressed up event, and on Christmas night, the next day, we have Christmas dinner with the whole family and all the children in the family, it’s more informal, and really a fun night. Five years ago, my ex husband John (whom we spent all holidays with even when we were no longer married) had recently died, and all my older children went to their in laws for the holidays, and instead of 20 at the table, and John being elegant and jovial and loving among us, we were going to be the 5 younger children and me for dinner on both nights: 6 of us, not twenty, no older kids, and no John. It was a radical change, and a sad time we were all wrestling with, and there was no way to pretend that it was going to be the same, or even a happy event, and we were all dreading it. So I decided to really turn it upside down, and told my 5 younger kids, in their early 20s, that they could do Christmas however they wanted that year. We could get dressed up, as we always did, and have a serious formal dinner, or wear blue jeans and eat pizza, or no dinner, invite friends or not, go to the movies, or go bowling, or leave town together—-if it was going to be different, I invited them to make it as different as they wanted. We didn’t have to please anyone but ourselves and each other. After discussing it among themselves, they decided they still wanted to get dressed up and stay at home, still go to mass on Christmas eve, and no one felt up to having friends over, but they wanted to play games at dinner, and we collected a bunch of ridiculous party games, including the White Elephant game, where everyone brings a gift of some kind, you don’t know who brought it, and you take turns and randomly pick a gift. If someone else likes the gift, they can steal it 3 times, and after that you’re safe, if you like the gift it’s yours. Let me tell you, it was ridiculous, the gifts were funny, everyone stole everything from everyone else, my youngest son flatly refused to give up his Chewbacca (from Star Wars) back pack, which he said he was going to wear to the office. We were loud and silly, had fun, we played lots of games, and cuddled up together and watched movies afterwards, and ate popcorn. Somehow just being together worked, we didn’t have to ‘behave’, and we all missed John terribly, but the love and laughter between us got us through the evening, and it was one of our sweetest holidays. I still have the pink ballet tutu that I stole from two of my daughters during the white elephant game. Sometimes you just have to make the best of what is, when things are different or not the way you hoped, like watching all your favorite movies on TV or DVD if you’re alone.\\nAnd I know it’s hard to be alone during the holidays. I hope that you can be with your family, or with friends, or people you like, or bring joy to someone else. And if Christmas isn’t quite the way you want it to be this year, I hope that you get through it peacefully, and that it will be better next year. Life changes, it flows, it gets better, and worse and better again, and everything does not depend on how great your Christmas is. I hope it will be a good one, even a great one, and if it is a small one this year, I hope that you can cherish it, and enjoy it anyway. I send you all my good thoughts, and thanks and love on this holiday, whatever your holidays, and I wish you a beautiful new year!!\\nwith all my love, Danielle',\n",

       " '(The blog will take a two-week spring break beginning next week to enjoy a visit with our visiting son, daughter-in-law and grandson and work on the upcoming issue of the Amelia island News-Wrecker to be distributed Thursday, May 4. We’ll be back April 27.)\\nSitting on the back porch in a pair of shorts, drinking a cold beer, reading a book, and looking up occasionally to watch TV reports of people up north scraping ice off their car windshields reminded me how fortunate I am to be living on Amelia Island, Florida.\\nMy Canadian parents, seeing pictures in National Geographic of happy people in Florida eating smoked mullet, decided to abandon the thrill of curling, gourmet plates of poutine and winters that extended from January 1 to December 31. They packed me, my older brother and enough Black Diamond cheddar cheese to last a couple of months, and headed south, a decision that I consider my inheritance.\\nI mention this because humorist Dave Barry, a transplant from upstate New York, has a new laugh-out-loud book called “Best State Ever, a Florida Man Defends His Homeland.”\\nBarry, who lives in Miami, details in his uproariously funny style, why people move here, why they stay, and why the state motto should be: “It may be hot, but it’s never boring.”\\nIn the Introduction he cites the weather as possibly the most positive factor saying: “Any day of the week I could walk out my front door naked and be perfectly physically comfortable until the police tasered me. Granted, sometimes in the summer (defined as June through the following June) it gets a little too warm down here, but too warm beats the hell out of too cold. Too cold means if you stay outside too long, you will die. Too warm means you might have to have another beer.”\\nHe writes about how much fun it is watching the weather reports from up north too adding: “Sometimes we get so emotional watching it even at 7 a.m. that we have to have ourselves another beer.”\\nIn addition to Florida’s weather he points out there are several other reasons that our state is attractive including: “low taxes, the hotness of its women, not being boring, and Disney World.” Barry explains how in just over two hours we can drive from Amelia Island to stand in line for four hours to get into Space Mountain.\\nHe also points out, much to the embarrassment of the rather dim folks we sent to our state capital of Tallahassee, how in 2015 the state marketing corporation, Visit Florida, named Pitbull as a “Florida ambassador” in which capacity he represented our state.\\n“Pitbull is a professional rap artist,” writes Barry. “He authored numerous tunes about having sex, doing drugs, shooting people, selling drugs, having sex on drugs, shooting people over drugs, etc. ”\\nPerhaps Barry’s hysterical expose of this snafu was one of the reasons Governor Rick Scott fired Visit Florida’s management and the state legislature is considering axing this entire group of ninnyhammers.\\nAnd this is just in the beginning of the book. As you read on you’ll discover with Dave the legendary skunk ape; mermaids at Weekie Watchee Springs and my favorite — a visit to Cassadaga, the Psychic Capital of the World (just three hour drive south of Amelia Island and no waiting in line).\\nTwo of the funniest chapters in the book are his description of The Villages and a trip with a pal to Key West.\\nI promise you that there’s a laugh on almost every page of this hilarious book, and at the end you’ll find yourself wishing it was longer.\\nIf you got the blues or just a cold then this book is the cure.\\nSpeaking Of Florida: Illegal aliens cost Florida households headed up by a U.S. citizen almost $981 per year but that figure is most certainly much higher by now.\\nThe Foundation for American Immigration Reform (FAIRUS.org) says there are 820,000 illegal aliens living in Florida and that they cost Florida tax payers $5.5 billion in 2010 at last count.\\nAnd forget those who claim these people pay their share of taxes. They don’t says FAIRUS. They only paid in $261 million in taxes collected by the state, leaving $5.2 billion for the tax payer to pick up.\\nThat comes to $3.34 billion in education; $660 million in health care; $317 million in public assistance; and $568 million in general government services.\\nBut relief may be in sight as illegal border crossing from Mexico have fallen 36 percent since February from the year before. Crossings also fell between January and February, when they normally increase as the weather gets warmer.\\nWhile open border advocates say illegal “immigration” is inevitable, February figures indicate otherwise showing that the flow of illegals is responding to incentives and that enforcement works. If the Great Southern Wall is eventually built the state-by-state savings to tax payers will be enormous.\\nLocal Political Rumors: Two Fernandina Beach City Commission seats are up this coming November 7 that are currently occupied by Tim Poynter and Robin Lentz, two of the most level-headed, competent, intelligent folks to ever serve the community. It’s difficult enough to find qualified people to run for an office that pays a lousy 12 grand a year and all the abuse they can handle. Unconfirmed rumors have it that Tim will be opposed by former commissioner, News-Leader left wing columnist, and retired high school indoctrination coordinator Ron “Get off my lawn you little bastards” Sapp, and Robin by former commissioner Sarah Pelican, a member of the Curly, Larry and Moe trio that caused so much havoc in a previous term. Putting Mr. Sapp and Ms. Pelican back on the commission would be like electing two children who put their hands over their ears because they don’t want to listen to Mother. To discuss issues with these two possible candidates voters can practice by holding conversations with five-year-olds.\\nKeep Your Distance From This Protestor: One of the organizers of ‘the recent women’s march is fighting deportation from America because she lied about having been convicted of terrorism, it has emerged.\\nIn an open letter printed in The Guardian, several authors including ‘Rasmea Yousef Odeh’ called on women across the US to take part in ‘striking, marching, blocking roads’ and other activities in a day of ‘grassroots, anti-capitalist feminism’.\\nBut what the letter doesn’t say is that Odeh, 69, was convicted of killing two young men after bombing an Israeli supermarket and now faces deportation from the US for lying about it in her citizenship application.

Out 10th President, John Tyler, who was born in 1790 and took office in 1841 following the death of President William Henry Harrison, has two grandchildren who are still living….NOT great grandchildren, BUT grandchildren. Their father was Tyler’s son Lyon Gardiner Tyler, one of President Tyler’s 15 kids, who was born in 1853. He fathered Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr. in 1924 and Harrison Ruffin Tyler in 1928. Harrison Tyler was interviewed by New York Magazine in 2012 and Lyon Tyler was a guest speaker not too long ago at a Daughters of the American Revolution meeting. Also, an interesting piece of history that many may not know about President Tyler is that he was “the only president to commit a public act of treason against the U.S. government.” According to “The Smithsonian Book of Presidential History”: “As president in the early 1840s, Tyler, who was a native Virginian, supported many policies his party did not — states rights and slavery, to name two. Sixteen years after leaving office, when civil war seemed inevitable, Tyler chaired a peace conference between representatives from the North and South with the goal of keeping the Union intact. When the peace efforts he spearheaded failed, Tyler embraced the Confederacy and urged fellow Virginians to join him. He was eventually elected to the Confederate Congress, which was officially at war with the country he once served.” Actually, Tyler died before he had a chance to take a seat in the Confederate Congress. Interesting stuff, I think.\\nDrinking, Dining & Dancing: Last week, when listing area pubs with cheap beer prices I failed to mention that the Salty Pelican has all-day $2 Narragansett tall boys. However, the best deal at the Pelican isn’t the two buck beer, but the $8 for a half pound of peel-and-eat shrimp. I’ve been to every eatery on the island and nearby that offer peel-and-eat shrimp and not one compares to the Pelican’s price or plumpness. Halftime’s Lorenzo Church recently introduced me to an All-Day IPA, that comes in a green 19 1/2 ounce can and sells for just $4 all day, every day.

       " \"Q: How can I remove exhaust stains on the transom and stern area? They don't come off with boat soap or spray cleaners very well.\\nA: Exhaust stains can turn a white transom gray and make an otherwise clean boat look dirty. Exhaust stains won’t harm your gel coat, but for cosmetic purposes, it’s something you probably want to keep on top of. However, as many of you know, they don’t always come off in the wash. Some spray cleaners are strong enough to remove exhaust stains, however if they’re strong enough for that job, then they’re probably also strong enough to eventually strip that area of wax, only making it harder to clean the exhaust stains off over time. The only way to remove them at that point is to buff and wax that area. Yes, it’s a vicious circle that you’re on, so how about skipping a step and going straight to the wax.\\nThe best way to remove exhaust stains from gel coat is to wax them off. This is something that can easily be done by hand with cleaner wax, such as Meguiars Cleaner Wax. Use any kind of rag to apply the wax with (terry cloth or an old t-shirt) and wipe or rub it in until the exhaust stains are gone. Then use a microfiber rag to wipe the hazy wax dust off. You’ll be left with a nice clean, white surface again and it should be a little easier to wipe exhaust stains off the next time since they’ll be sitting on top of a freshly waxed surface.\\nDeckhand Detailing, established in 1990, offers affordable and high quality boat cleaning and detailing services including boat washing, boat buffing and waxing, interior and exterior cleaning and more.

       " 'L3 Shops for a Shipyard — and a Place in the Defense Industry’s Top Tier\\nIts bullish new CEO wants America’s sixth-largest defense firm viewed in the same group as the Big 5.\\nL3 Technologies is eying a shipyard as the company deepens its push into the underwater drone market and beyond, Defense One has learned.\\nThe move comes as new CEO Christopher Kubasik looks to grow America’s sixth-largest defense company. While Kubasik tiptoed around a question about an expansion into shipbuilding on the company’s quarterly earnings call Tuesday, he made several bullish comments about plans for more acquisitions and growing the firm’s infrastructure.\\n“Everything is on the table,” Kubasik said. “If it makes sense, we’ll pursue it.”\\nL3 spent more than $300 million on acquisitions in 2017, and expects to top that in 2018, Kubasik said.\\nThe company “can easily make $1 billion of acquisitions a year,” he said. “We’ll be happy to do larger acquisitions if they make sense strategically and operationally and financially.”\\nL3 is about to be flush with cash. On Tuesday, company officials announced a $540 million sale of its Vertex services business, plus aerospace units Crestview Aerospace and TCS, to a private equity firm. Kubasik said he expects the deal, which will close this summer, to generate $400 million after-tax to be “put to use based on our strategic priorities.”\\nL3’s shipyard search was the buzz among at last month’s Navy League Sea-Air-Space conference — the largest maritime trade show in the U.S., held annually in a Washington, D.C., suburb.\\nNew York-based L3 has been scooping up companies that specialize in autonomous underwater drone technology. At Sea-Air-Space, it showed off its Iver Precision Workhorse, an autonomous undersea vehicle. A company statement called the sub “the first in a family of advanced, highly capable military AUVs to address a wide variety of customer missions, including multi-domain intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, seabed warfare and mine warfare.” The drone is made by OceanServer, which L3 acquired last year. The U.S. Navy alone is expected to invest $3 billion in undersea technology, the Washington Post reported in 2016.\\n“The No. 1 way to improve margins in my opinion has always been to increase the denominator and to grow,” Kubasik said Tuesday on the earnings call. “I think volume is the best way to improve your profitability and that’s why we’ve rolled out our disciplined growth strategy and myself and my team and others have been aggressively out there meeting with customers both as a supplier to the primes and directly to the end uses to try to jumpstart the growth.”\\nKubasik wants his company, which had 2017 defense revenues of $8.9 billion, viewed alongside the “Big 5”: Lockheed Martin ($43.7 billion), Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics ($19.7 billion).\\n“Our ultimate goal is to have the scale and capabilities to compete for programs as a non-traditional, sixth price [contractor],” he said.\\nL3 is amid a leadership transition. Kubasik took over as CEO in January, but his predecessor, Michael Strianese, remained chairman. Kubasik is poised to become chairman following a vote at a shareholders meeting next Monday.\\nIn another sign of its push deeper into the naval market, L3 in January appointed Sean Stackley as corporate vice president of strategic advanced programs and technology. Stackley oversaw the Navy’s acquisition portfolio for more than nine years, and served as acting Navy secretary for more than half of 2017.\\n“I think by the end of the calendar year we’ll have the entire team in place and ready to go,” Kubasik said of changes within the firm’s leadership.',\n",
       " 'By Michelle Miao, Talawanda High School\\nAmerica, 美国, means “beautiful kingdom” in Chinese, but it’s been increasingly difficult to see much beauty in the country that I was born in and love. Since the start of the pandemic, hate crimes against Asians have spiked, with more than 3,000 reports in the past year alone. The racism has been exacerbated by xenophobic and harmful rhetoric from the highest levels of government. Donald Trump derisively labeled COVID-19 the “China virus” and the “kung flu,” gleefully telling a campaign rally crowd, “I can name 19 different versions of names.” During the height of the crisis, the most powerful person in the country not only made it acceptable to blame and hate us; he encouraged it.\\nHowever, racism against people of Asian descent is nothing new; it’s nearly as old as America itself. When Chinese workers first came to America in the mid-19th century, they were exploited for their labor and used to construct railroads across the west, but were shunned by white settlers and barred from becoming citizens. As “yellow peril” swept through the nation, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusionary Act, banning Chinese immigration to America. In 1871, a white mob entered Chinatown and brutally murdered 18 Chinese men and boys in one of the worst lynchings in American history. In this same period, and well into the 20th century, Asian workers in the fish-canning industry faced similar exploitation, discrimination and violence. During World War II, President Roosevelt designated the forced incarceration of over 100,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans, labeling them all as threats to the nation. In 1989, five elementary school students in California were killed by a gunman in the Stockton shooting, targeted because they were refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia.\\nAs a first-generation American, I carry these stories with me. My parents emigrated from China in the hope that their children would find greater opportunity in the United States. As part of an ethnic minority, however, I also have greater understanding of America’s painful past. In the last year, I’ve been lucky enough to avoid racial slurs or other harms. Still, I live in fear that a trip to the grocery store might turn into a confrontation with an ignorant stranger. I worry constantly that my ten-year-old sister might be bullied at school, called “coronavirus” or accused of bringing the pandemic to America.\\nAsians tend to be perceived as a docile, quiet minority group. I get that; it’s in our community culture to minimize the harassment we face. We’re unused to speaking up about the pain of racism, and in many instances, we have felt the bitterness of our experiences being ignored or diminished. Even among the Asian people I know, there’s oftentimes a feeling of inevitability surrounding racism. Sure, a certain experience was horrible and unfortunate, but it was a misunderstanding that we should brush off and move on from.\\nThis attitude has to change. Increasing Asian visibility and amplifying Asian voices should be a top priority in combatting hate. To begin with, the word “Asian” describes a huge community of people from (or generations removed from) a plethora of countries sprawling across half the globe, and covers a vast socio-economic range in America. Far from being the shining “model minority” of pop-culture stereotypes, Asian-Americans actually have a higher poverty rate than white households, and many new and first-generation immigrants face dismal standards of living.\\nThe shootings in Atlanta draw our attention to low-income Asian immigrants who work at massage parlors, spas, and other jobs that put Asian workers at extra risk of sexual and racial discrimination. The Atlanta shooter claimed a “sex addiction” in defense of the massacre, denying he had any racial motive. Common sense tells us that he knew exactly whose lives he would be ending when he walked through the doors of Young’s Asian Massage. Moreover, his outlet for sex points to the lens of Orientalism, through which Westerners reduce Asian women to exotic sexual objects. The shooting shows every characteristic of an anti-Asian hate crime.\\nAfter every shooting or attack on minorities, America expresses shock and dismay and jumps to take action in ways that seek to alleviate symptoms without addressing the underlying diseases of racism, misogyny, and hatred. As a member of the Asian-American community, I’ve been tensely following reports of Asian hate crimes for the past year—a father and his children stabbed at the store, an elderly Asian man shoved down on the street, a Filipino man slashed across the face with a box cutter. Along this vein, the Atlanta shooting was almost predictable.\\nIn its aftermath, I fervently hope that this marks a turning point. There isn’t a quick solution to resolving anti-Asian hatred. It means dismantling centuries of discrimination and violent oppression, but it can start with paying attention to the lasting effects of this history in today’s society. We must recognize and call out casual scapegoating of the Asian community. We must educate ourselves and others about America’s history of discrimination against people of Asian descent, have difficult conversations, and support the Asian community, because as long as one minority faces discrimination, no one can truly be free.\\nWe also need the advocacy and support of our elected officials, who have the power to bring the Asian community out of the shadows. This week’s House hearing on anti-Asian discrimination was the first in three decades; it was both a necessary start and yet not enough. History will continue to repeat itself until the Asian community and its allies mobilize. By targeting the common enemy of systemic white supremacy, we can transform our grief and horror into meaningful action. This will hopefully not only prevent another Atlanta, but also truly make America a beautiful kingdom.\\nLearn more about the history of anti-Asian discrimination and violence in the United States, and what students can do to support the community:\\nAnd here are two of many Asian-American advocacy groups to consider supporting:\\nFor the Georgia victims: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-georgias-asian-american-community/\\nHate is a Virus: https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/hateisavirus',\n",

       " 'Before we head out for our annual holiday break and bid farewell to 2022, we want to take a few moments to celebrate the past year and extend our heartfelt gratitude to you, our players, for making it all possible.\\n2022 was a fantastic year for Guild Wars 2, and it started off with a bang. On February 28, we released our third expansion, Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons™, which brought a climactic end to the elder dragon saga (spoiler!). The team poured their heart and soul into bringing a reimagined Cantha to life, and in the end, we delivered an experience that we’re incredibly proud of.\\nBut the expansion is just one part of this year’s story. Living World Season 1—which had previously been unplayable for over eight years—returned as a free and permanent addition to the base game. We delivered significant quality-of-life gameplay improvements for both new players and veterans, with more to come. We made considerable progress on long-term initiatives like the DirectX11 upgrade and WvW World Restructuring, and we renewed our focus on regularly refreshing key gameplay systems like combat. And we released Guild Wars 2 on Steam, putting Tyria on the map for an entirely new group of gamers.\\nWe’ve also reinforced our commitment to being transparent and communicating regularly with all of you, with regular studio updates, quarterly roadmaps, and balance preview livestreams. In the background, we’ve been working quietly on our next content update, and we began early development on our fourth expansion. In the midst of everything, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of Guild Wars 2‘s original release—an achievement only made possible by the support of our community.\\nAll of this paid off in a big way. Back in April, we reported that our active player count had more than doubled over the past few years and that Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons had already outsold our previous expansion, Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire™. Today, we’re excited to share a new accomplishment. This year we’ve already seen more players venture into Tyria for the first time since 2015— the year we made the base game content playable for free and launched our first expansion, Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns™. This has been one of the best years for Guild Wars 2 in recent memory, and we’re eager to keep building on that momentum.\\nWe’ll be back early next year to talk about our Q1 plans, which include wrapping up the DirectX11 transition, continuing work on World vs. World, upgrading our in-game browser technology from Coherent to Chromium Embedded Framework, and of course new Guild Wars 2: End of Dragons content. We’re also looking forward to sharing our long-term vision and plans for the game.\\nThank you all for a fantastic 2022. Let’s do it again next year.\\nHave a wonderful Wintersday!\\n—The Guild Wars 2 Team',\n",

Access will be maintained for residents in the first stage of work between Water Lane and Higher Cadewell Lane.\\nThe work is expected to take in total around seven weeks to complete.

       " 'This 70 year old projector lens creates “insane swirly bokeh” that rivals a $7K Leica\\nWeird and crazy lenses is what Mathieu Stern has become known for. He seems to find some of the most unusual lenses that ever existed, and then makes them fit onto his Sony mirrorless camera. Fortunately for us, he posts images and video captured by those lenses he finds to YouTube.\\nAnd this particular lens is a beauty. A Carl Zeiss Kipronar 120mm f/1.9 projector lens which cost him only $70. It’s fixed wide open at f/1.9 and was never meant to be used for shooting photos. But Mathieu was able to adapt it. He says the closest he could find to a modern equivalent of this lens is the $7,000 Leica APO-Macro_Summarit-S F2.5/120mm.\\nIt’s a cheap lens, but it’s very rare, and you have to be a boss at manual focusing. About the lens, Mathieu notes…\\n- It’s heavy as hell\\n- There is no aperture, so you shoot at f/1.9 all the time\\n- The focus helicoid is at the base of the lens, not the tip\\n- At f/1.8 it’s extremely hard to nail focus on video\\nMathieu describes it as being very sharp in the centre which gets swirly as you head out toward the edges. But you need to be a master at manual focusing.\\nIt’s a very cool look, although Mathieu says don’t ask him for an Amazon link to buy it. They’re not made any more and it’s rare.\\nSo, if you want one, get hunting.\\nJohn Aldred is a photographer with over 20 years of experience in the portrait and commercial worlds.

       " 'In today’s world, language industries, Translation and applied Traductology can be essential tools to allow an effective transfer of cultural, scientific and technical heritage beyond the limits imposed by languages and, above all, by administrative frontiers. Translation, understood as an applied discipline of Philology and Linguistics, is the best bridge to achieve interculturality and the effective transmission of ideas. Translation is the best resource to overcome administrative frontiers and to allow knowledge across different cultures, languages and literatures.\\nThat way, there will be no more frontiers; the texts of European “classics” will be accessible, even in the oldest editions (princepes and even in facsimile), which may prove inaccessible or prohibitive, and, besides, European “classics”, duly translated, will be available to all readers. We can provide these polyglot editions with “appendixes” that will make them especially interesting for scholars: concords, stemming, frequency indexes, vocabularies, glossaries, multimedia elements, educational resources, etc. All in all, we have to create cultural products marked by the excellence of their contents, authors or researchers, which prove to be suitable for the specialist public and, at the same time, for the general public. This is what we are currently developing with our projects IVITRA and TRAMICTEK, respectively, the INTERNATIONAL TRANSLATION VIRTUAL INSTITUTE and the EUROPEAN NETWORK OF EXCELLENCE and STREP “Translation, Multilingualism, Information and Communication Technologies, and Transference of Knowledge”.\\nIt is an interdisciplinary methodology that has objectives, which although they are specified in reference works, can be easily extrapolated and adaptable to other authors who, in general, present similar conditions to the ones we have mentioned previously. This kind of studies may provide a more solid and founded knowledge (diachronic and synchronic) of the history of language in question. In any case, it may make possible the exhaustive study of the lexicon of the author in question, its graphic fixation and its semantic charge, establishing a perspective contrasted with the lexicon of other coeval authors. Finally, they may offer historical or classical (ancient and also modern) referents useful to enrich the knowledge of translation theory and practice.',\n",

[photo/agencies]\\nthe latest interest-rate increase by the us federal reserve should provide a clearer picture of how much impact the extra cash sloshing around in the economy from covid-19 pandemic stimulus has had on inflation.\\nthe central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point (75 basis points) on wednesday in an effort to cool the most intense burst of inflation since the 1980s, with \"ongoing increases\" in borrowing costs still ahead despite some signs of a slowing economy.\\n\"inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,\" the federal open market committee (fomc) said as it lifted its policy rate to a range of between 2.25 percent and 2.50 percent in a unanimous vote. the fomc did note, however, that \"recent indicators of spending and production have softened\".\\nthe american economy is still working through pent-up demand from covid-19-related suppression of economic activity. that demand also was heightened by global supply chain backlogs, which led to fewer goods on shelves.\\ncoupled with trillions of dollars in the government’s pandemic-stimulus funding, demand is still making its way through the proverbial python.\\nin march, the federal reserve bank of san francisco estimated that government stimulus may have added three percentage points to the national inflation rate.\\n\"inflation is leading to record-low consumer sentiment, but consumers are still spending,\" wrote greg daco, chief economist at ey-parthenon, adding that the us economy is currently \"a world of paradox\".\\n\"since the onset of the pandemic, lawmakers have spent about $6 trillion on various income-support programs for households and businesses,\" wrote donald luskin, chief investment officer of trendmacro, in a piece in the wall street journal.\\n\"that all dropped straight into the bank accounts that are part of m2, which also grew about $6 trillion over precisely the same period.\"\\nm2 is cash in circulation along with liquid bank and money-market fund balances.\\nluskin quoted famed economist milton friedman who said that \"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\".\\ngrowth in m2 peaked at an astronomical 27 percent in february 2021, but has been falling since, luskin said.\\none area where higher interest rates have an immediate impact is the housing market.\\nsigned contracts for the purchase of existing homes plunged 20 percent in june compared with a year ago, the national association of realtors (nar) said wednesday.\\npending home sales also fell 8.6 percent in june from may, far more than expected.\\nthe interest rate on 30-year mortgages has recently averaged 5.54 percent, according to freddie mac, chartered by congress in 1970 to support the us housing finance system.\\n\"contract signings to buy a home will keep tumbling down as long as mortgage rates keep climbing, as has happened this year to date,\" said lawrence yun, chief economist for nar.\\nthe fed has raised its policy interest rate by 225 basis points this year as it battles a 1980s-level breakout of inflation — with that decade’s approach to monetary policy.\\nwith the most recent consumer price index data showing prices rising at more than 9 percent, investors expect the fed to raise rates by at least a half-percentage point at its september meeting.\\n\"i don’t think the economy is in recession right now,\" federal reserve chair jerome powell said wednesday at a post-fomc meeting news conference.\\npowell repeatedly said that the fed’s target goal for inflation is 2 percent.\\n\"the economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. it is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all,\" powell said.\\nsalman ahmed, global head of macro for fidelity international in london told reuters: \"the continued focus on inflation and labor-market strength was striking in the press conference comments as the two main drivers behind the pace of hiking. we think a significant slowdown is already in the pipeline and will start to show in hard data in the coming weeks and months.\\n\"however, continued strength in the labor market — with only very tentative signs of some easing in demand and supply pressures — and the fed’s focus on lagging hard data means another 75bp hike is possible at the next meeting. the risk here is that the fed tightens policy too far too quickly, making a hard landing inevitable.\"\\nseema shah, chief global strategist at principal global investors, wrote that \"with the labor market still a picture of strength, wage growth still uncomfortably high and core inflation set to decline at a glacially slow pace, the fed certainly cannot stop tightening, nor can it downshift gears too much\".\\nbrian coulton, chief economist at fitch ratings, said, \"the fed’s statement acknowledged the recent softening in activity data but this is given short shrift in the presence of what is still a very robust labor market and unrelenting inflation pressures.\\n\"given where core inflation and the unemployment rate (3.6 percent) currently stand, this underscores that monetary policy adjustment still has quite a long way to go. market expectations that the fed may be cutting rates again next year look premature.\"\\ngina chon, a columnist for reuters’ breaking views, wondered if powell could face political ramifications from the rapid rate increases.\\n\"what’s the cost if powell pushes too far? for him, not much. he can’t be removed, short of misconduct, until 2028. he also has broad backing from congress. powell was reconfirmed in his current role in may by 80 of the 99 senators who voted,\" she wrote.\\n\"he has also schmoozed more effectively than other fed chiefs. in his first year as chair in 2018, he had nearly 100 meetings with members of congress, while his predecessor, janet yellen, had 22 such gatherings, according to their public calendars.\"\\nchon added though that \"politicians can pester fed chiefs in other ways\".\\nshe mentioned paul volcker, who presided over a 19 percent effective federal funds rate and two recessions in the 1980s and faced several resolutions in congress demanding his impeachment.\\nreuters contributed to this story.',\n",

       " 'State-regulated online gambling has slowly spread throughout many Canadian provinces over the last few years. In 2010, Ontario declared its intent to launch an online casino in the region, but it’s taken all this time to reach fruition. Last week, PlayOLG finally went live with its province-wide hard launch.\\nA press release from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) went out on January 8, 2015, to announce the highly anticipated launch of PlayOLG. Previously, the Canadian online casino was only available to “eligible members of the OLG Winner’s Circle Rewards program”, who participated in an exhaustive beta-testing phase during the soft launch period.\\nOntarians of legal age now have access to a modest assortment of online gambling amusements. The initial hard launch comes with 21 graphically rich video slots and 8 table games. Ontarian gamblers will find popular titles like Blackjack, Fast Poker (3 card poker), Mini Baccarat, Sic Bo, War and 3 Roulette variations; American Roulette, European Roulette and Roulette Supreme. The website details the addition of five-card video poker amusements “coming soon”.\\nMembers of PlayOLG will also be able to secure the purchase of state lottery tickets, including LOTTO 6/49 and LOTTO MAX, as well as adding ENCORE numbers to those tickets.\\n“We are excited to launch PlayOLG,” said Vice President of OLG John Wisternoff, commending the launch as, “an important milestone in the modernization of gaming in Ontario.” Wisternoff went on to extoll the player protections now offered by the new online casino. “For Ontarians who love the excitement of gaming, PlayOLG offers a safe and regulated alternative to grey market websites.”\\nThe announcement came with the delineation of the PlayOLG’s superior customer support services. A dedicated support team has been locally employed by Ontario officials (no unintelligible accents here) to deliver 24/7 assistance via toll-free telephone, live chat support and email.\\nOLG briefly touched on the subject of the lengthy delays involved in the launch of its provincial online casino website by detailing the commission’s efforts to ensure the maintenance of responsible gambling practices. According to the press release, PlayOLG has a number of Responsible Gambling (RG) tools embedded directly into the software. Those tools were developed to integrate “Canadian and global best practices” after extensive research involving addiction specialists, professional research consultants and investors.\\nThe RG programs installed by the OLG have received international acclaim, including reception of the World Lottery Association (WLA) Best Overall Responsible Gambling Program Award in November of 2014. Such safeguards include the exemption of anonymous players, age/identity verification upon registration, mandatory deposit/loss/play-time limitations, customized in-game RG messaging systems, self-exclusion options and more.\\nOne unique aspect of the Canadian online casino is that if a player wishes to increase their spending limits, upon request, they must undergo a 7-day cooling off period in which they cannot access the real-money games. Players also have access to a complete history of their online casino account, and parents will find a multitude of tips on how to prevent their children from accessing PlayOLG or any other online gambling websites.\\nIt’s been estimated that half a million Ontarians have been spending $400-$500 million at offshore, “grey market” gambling websites. The provincial launch of PlayOLG now puts Ontario on par with other Canadian territories that have previously introduced legal, state-regulated online casinos, including British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec, and the Atlantic Provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.',\n",

       " 'NRMA ends free electric-car fast-charging in NSW\\nAustralia’s largest motoring club will ask electric-car owners to pay for fast-charging from the end of the year, after providing the service to members and non-members for free.\\nThe National Roads and Motorists\\' Association (NRMA) will move away from providing free fast-charging for all electric-car owners – instead introducing a smartphone app towards the end of 2023 for drivers to pay for a battery top-up, providing funding to expand its network.\\nAs reported by electric-car publication The Driven, the NRMA – which claims to have more than 2.7 million members in Australia – will no longer offer free charging to electric-car owners across its network of 50kW fast chargers.\\nThe NRMA’s fast-charging network – which consists of more than 50 charging stations along major highways connecting regional hubs in New South Wales and border regions – is currently accessible to all electric-car owners, not just members of the motoring club.\\nAccording to The Driven, the NRMA’s free charging stations are often busy, resulting in long queues of electric-car drivers waiting to use the chargers.\\nCarly Irving-Dolan, the head of NRMA Energy, told The Driven the motoring club is developing a smartphone app which would allow users to pay for a fast-charge when it moves away from free charging for all, with a trial due to begin before the end of 2023.\\n“The aim is that around October (or) November (2023) is when we will start to look at a trial (for billing),” Ms Irving-Dolan told The Driven’s podcast. “And if we can get that right, then we’ll go from there. But that is the plan.”\\nWhile the NRMA is yet to announce pricing for its electric-car fast chargers, Ms Irving-Dolan said it aims to be ‘competitive’ compared to other companies – while discounts for NRMA members and fleet/business operators could also be on the cards.\\nFor context, Evie and Chargefox – which is now owned by a consortium of Australia’s motoring clubs, including the NRMA – charge 40 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for electric-car drivers to use their 50kWh fast-chargers.\\nBy requiring electric-car owners to pay to use the chargers, the NRMA aims to both reduce the number of people using the facilities – leading to shorter queues – while funding further upgrades to its charging network.\\nIn April 2023, the NRMA announced it would partner with the Australian Government to spend $78.6 million on funding an additional 117 fast-charging locations around the country – not just in New South Wales.\\nAs the NRMA aims to start making electric-car drivers pay for its fast-chargers, energy firm AGL has announced it will offer discounted rates to certain customers who use oil giant BP’s ‘Pulse’ charging stations.\\nIn a media statement, the three-year agreement – which will run from July 2023 until 2026 – will allow AGL customers in New South Wales who purchase its ‘EV (electric-vehicle) home energy plan’ to receive discounted charging rates at BP Pulse sites.\\nNeither AGL or BP Pulse provided details about how much of a discount customers would receive, instead claiming the program will align with BP’s plans to open 600 recharging points in \"key metropolitan and regional BP retail locations along Australia’s east coast\".\\nAt present, there are approximately 30 BP Pulse electric-car charging stations in Australia, located in New South Wales, Victoria and Brisbane – largely along major highways or in metropolitan areas.',\n",
       " 'We’ve created a list of the 5 best job interview tips for truck drivers to follow. With so many different companies to choose from, knowing how to prepare yourself for the trucking job market can be difficult—read more to make your next interview a success and make the next step in your career.\\n1. Recognize the Questions & Match Them to Your Experience\\nThis is the best job interview tip for truck drivers and many other careers for a reason. The more familiar you are with common questions asked in trucking interviews, the more prepared you can be to answer them thoughtfully, thoroughly, and with regards to your previous experience. Here are some interview questions specifically related to truck driving that you should reflect upon when practicing for your next interview:\\n- Where have you travelled to in your trucking career? Are you more familiar with certain areas and regions than others?\\n- How do you plan out your trucking routes in advance? What are the steps you take to travel the most efficient routes possible?\\n- What is the longest haul you have had to make as a truck driver? How did you manage to keep your focus while also fulfilling your duties on time?\\n- What identification, paperwork, or time logs do you keep on-hand while trucking?\\n- Have you ever had an accident while on the road? If so, how were you able to handle the situation calmly and effectively?\\nThough these are far from the only questions you’ll be expected to answer, they are a great starting point for knowing what to expect from your next truck driving interview.\\n2. Be Familiar With Unexpected Trucking Scenarios\\nReflecting on your experience in the truck driving industry can help you respond to tough situations that may come up while on the road. In truck driving interviews, you’ll likely be asked how you have handled unexpected scenarios in a fast and efficient manner. Some example scenarios that you can use to begin reflecting on your own experience include:\\n- Imagine a situation where you were running late on a delivery due to a traffic jam or a mistake in your route. How could you maintain safe and legal driving standards while preserving your quality customer service?\\n- What would you do in a scenario where you were involved in an accident caused by another driver?\\n- In a situation where your truck needed maintenance while on the road, what forms of basic maintenance could you provide? What are maintenance problems that you would need to contact outside help for?\\nIf you are new to the world of truck driving, it may be difficult for you to think of what you may do in an unexpected scenario while in the field. This is why it is important to do additional research on the truck driving lifestyle and the many experiences of more seasoned veterans in the trucking industry. You can visit our blog to read more about the kinds of situations you may encounter on the road, as well as lifestyle tips for truckers new and old.\\n3. Know Your Truck Driving Record and How to Discuss It\\nThough there are some companies willing to take newly licensed drivers on the road, many trucking companies are looking to hire drivers with at least some field experience. Interviewers like to interview candidates with consistently successful driving records, including no previous accidents and an accurate record of on-time deliveries. However, even if you have some less positive marks on your driving record, you can still speak to your experience in becoming a better driver through the difficult scenarios you have faced. If you need help learning about how to talk about your truck driving experience, consider how you demonstrate the top qualities of a good truck driver so you can speak confidently about your professional record in your next interview.\\n4. Research the Trucking Company — Know Their Cargo\\nTo excel in a trucking interview, you want to demonstrate to your interviewer that you have carefully considered their company and are familiar with what your specific role as a driver would be like for their company. Depending on the breadth of your experience in the trucking field, you may be looking for a company that specializes in shipping a specific type of cargo with policies and general protocols that you’re already familiar with. If you’re looking into a company whose cargo is less related to your previous experience, you’ll want to do additional research on any certificates or training you may need to carry certain cargo. Check out our list of partnered trucking companies to get a head start on the many company options you have to continue your career on the road.\\n5. Ask Questions About Trucking for the Company\\nJust as the company you’re interviewing with wants to know if you’re the right candidate for the job, you want to ensure that the company you’re interviewing with can meet your needs and expectations as a truck driver. Though you won’t want to ask equally as many questions as you are given, there are some key questions for you to keep in mind as you consider your future career:\\n- What is your home time policy for your company’s drivers?\\n- Does your company pay the commercial truck insurance required for my work vehicle?\\n- What is your company-’s fueling policy?\\n- Does your company pay drivers on an hourly basis, or per-mile?\\n- As a driver for your company, how and when will my performance and progress be measured?\\n- Are your company’s truckers also responsible for the loading and unloading of cargo?\\nLooking to Start Your Truck Driving Career? Truck Driver Institute Is Here for You!\\nWhether you’re gearing up for your first trucking interview or you’re looking to get your first trucking licesnse, TDI is here to help you launch your career in the trucking industry.

       " 'Non-Prescription Treatments For Psoriasis Flare-Ups\\nIn Part One of this article, we discussed non-prescription treatments for psoriasis. There are several things your doctor can and should check, including food allergies and medication side effects. There are also non-prescription treatments offered at our holistic clinic that you may not have tried. But I also get asked, “What can I do at home to prevent psoriasis flare-ups?”\\nWhat Else Can I Do To Help Psoriasis Flare-Ups?\\nGet Some Sun\\nSunshine (or perhaps the vitamin D it gives us) seems to help calm psoriasis. Perhaps it’s part of the calming effect of nature, which reduces stress. Certainly getting out in nature in the sunshine can help. If you’re using a coal tar treatment for psoriasis, be aware that it can cause you to sunburn more easily, so be extra careful not to overexpose your skin to sunlight for too long.\\nSpeaking of reducing stress, any methods you can use to limit stress in your life can be helpful. Put off stressful decisions, avoid people who seem to increase the stress in your life, and perhaps cut back your on-the-job activities for a bit. Meditation, mindfulness, yoga, Tai Chi, deep breathing and other forms of stress reduction can be helpful. Better sleep helps reduce stress, of course, but it can be a struggle when you’re dealing with a severe case of psoriasis.\\nAnother way to relieve stress and help your skin directly is increasing the number of warm (not hot) baths you take. Try an Epsom salt or oatmeal bath, or a bath oil that contains aloe vera or jojoba to help keep your skin moist. Daily 20 minute baths are recommended.\\nKeeping your skin moist can be helpful for most psoriasis. Try a pure aloe vera or jojoba gel or cream.\\nWork On Your Self Talk\\nBeating up on yourself isn’t going to help your skin – quite the opposite is true. This is a good time to go easy on yourself and rein in any inclinations to be self-critical. If this is a big struggle for you, counselling can help quite quickly.\\nStop Smoking, Limit Alcohol\\nEat More Fatty Fish\\nFatty fish such as salmon, sardines, cod, trout, and others give your body anti-inflammatory omega-3s, which have been linked to reducing inflammation.\\nCheck Your Humidity\\nIn dry climates, a humidifier can help. Humidity between 30 and 50 percent is recommended by the Mayo Clinic.\\nTry Some (Good Quality) Supplements\\nFish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B-12, and selenium have all been linked to reducing inflammation. One study showed good results with Oregon Grape supplements. Our office can advise on specific types and brands.\\nWork With Your Doctor\\nIt’s important to understand that a serious and persistent case with frequent psoriasis flare-ups may not be something you can handle at home on your own. Working with a holistic practice like ours can help you with the allergy testing, treatments, and dietary management to help you reduce incidents and help you live more comfortably.',\n",

       " \"On ADA’s 31st Anniversary, Duckworth Speaks at FDR Memorial Wreath Laying and Calls for Accessibility and Inclusion\\n[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – As our nation marks the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) today, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) joined U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) as well as members of the FDR Memorial Legacy Committee’s Advisory Board at the FDR Memorial to honor President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s leadership as the first known United States President with a significant physical disability and highlight the importance of disability representation and the work we must do to achieve full accessibility and inclusion. Video of the Senator’s remarks can be found here.\\n“While we’ve come a long way since the ink dried on the ADA 31 years ago, we still have a long way to go to make this country truly accessible for Americans with disabilities, including at National Parks like the FDR Memorial, on our transportation systems and more,” said Duckworth. “From updating illegible braille text on the walls of this memorial to passing my ASAP Act to help make our transit stations more accessible, all of our laws should safeguard every American’s constitutionally-enshrined rights, rather than punishing the very people whom our country has already discriminated against for too long. I was proud to join Congresswoman Norton and the FDR Memorial Legacy Committee’s Advisory Board to mark this important day in our nation’s history for disability rights, and I look forward to continuing our work to bring about a tomorrow where we won’t have to work so hard just to live our daily lives.”\\nEarlier this year, Duckworth and Norton introduced a resolution recognizing the successful campaign led by disability advocates to secure a statue of FDR in a wheelchair in the Prologue Room at the FDR Memorial and urging the National Park Service (NPS) to make the memorial accessible to everyone by installing tactile braille throughout the space and supporting the development of accessible education materials for visitors. In May, Duckworth introduced her All Stations Accessibility Program Act to help make public transportation systems more accessible to passengers with disabilities.\\nThis week, Duckworth sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Haaland urging the National Park Service to take action to make the FDR Memorial fully accessible to blind or visually impaired.\\nFull text of the letter can be found here and below:\\nJuly 26, 2021\\nThe Honorable Deb Haaland\\nSecretary of Interior\\nDepartment of Interior\\n1849 C Street, NW\\nWashington DC 20240\\nDear Secretary Haaland:\\nI write today regarding the inaccessibility of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial (FDR Memorial) for people with disabilities and to respectfully request the National Park Service (NPS) address the numerous accessibility issues, which have lasted for decades, in time for the memorial’s 25th anniversary on May 2, 2022.\\nA recent report by Dr. Cheryl Fogle-Hatch outlines a number of ways in which the FDR Memorial fails to meet accessibility standards, particularly for people who are blind or visually impaired. Dr. Fogle-Hatch explains in detail how the FDR Memorial falls short in providing accessible options, including:\\n- the NPS website failing to provide brochures with updated Unified English Braille (UEB);\\n- the memorial not displaying legible Braille on the walls of the memorial; and\\n- the lack of protective barriers that are of proper height for blind individuals.\\nFurthermore, there is evidence that these issues have been longstanding as they were highlighted in The Washington Post article, “FDR Memorial's Braille Letters Pose Sizable Problem for Blind” as early as 1997. To these shortcomings, Dr. Fogle-Hatch’s report provides detailed and straight-forward recommendations for improvement. Further, without these modifications, the NPS is failing to uphold the very values that promote disability rights enshrined in the Prologue Room at the FDR Memorial itself.\\nI have introduced Senate Resolution 86 (S.Res.86) to call for the recommitment of the United States to the promotion of disability rights and to the values enshrined in the Prologue Room of the FDR Memorial. This resolution calls on NPS and the National Park Foundation to continue to increase access to the FDR Memorial for individuals with disabilities and to support the development of accessible educational materials.\\nIt is past due that NPS honor the needs of the disabled community and make the FDR Memorial fully accessible. I urge the NPS to move swiftly to incorporate the recommendations of Dr. Fogle-Hatch at the FDR Memorial to improve accessibility. Specifically, I urge NPS to facilitate the following:\\n- the creation of a mobile guide accessible by smartphones to allow individuals with disabilities to use their own preferred accessibility settings;\\n- update the FDR Memorial’s brochure to conform to current UEB code and include a descriptive layout of the Memorial;\\n- add wayside interpretive panels in print and UEB code around the Memorial; and\\n- install guardrails around the in-ground fountain in Room One that are no higher than 27 inches, in order to allow the barrier to be detected by a standard white cane.\\nWhile we’ve come closer to having true representation for our community at this memorial, we will never truly reach that milestone until every American can access and enjoy it. Incorporating these recommendations would illustrate NPS’s commitment to civil rights and allegiance to creating public spaces to be enjoyed by all Americans.\\nSeveral disability organizations have been fighting for accessibility at our Nation’s parks and memorials for decades, highlighting that this is an important and pressing issue for the disability community. As the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the FDR Memorial Prologue Room approaches, I am confident we will find a path forward in addressing these issues. I understand that some recent efforts and planning have been initiated for this Memorial, I look forward to hearing what those are. I deeply appreciate your urgent consideration of these recommendations, and I look forward to your commitment to improving accessibility at the FDR Memorial.\\nNext Article Previous Article\",\n",
       " 'If you look at it superficially, personal finance is everything to do with money: how to get richer, where best to invest, and so on.\\nAll of this, of course, is part of personal finance. But personal finance has nothing to do with money. Rather miss placed priorities and value regarding money.\\nLearn to manage your money\\nMoney is not the problem, the problem is the lack of it. Of course, money can’t buy happiness, but it’s not easy to be strapped for cash, and it can in turn cause a great deal of stress. Obviouls the level of stress will vary depending on the situation.\\nPoverty is not just a physical limitation. It is also a way of thinking. When poverty takes over, we begin to think differently. When we think about money all the time, we begin to notice other things, to evaluate our own choices differently, to anticipate events differently, to make decisions differently, and to behave differently.\\nWhether we like it or not, money has power. Most of us are highly dependent on it, and that’s where personal finance comes in. Personal finance is all about knowing how to manage money and understanding how to report cash income without a 1099 form to take advantage of it. It’s about being able to take control of your money. Ironically, the main goal of personal finance is to stop thinking about money altogether.\\nMoney is not an end in itself, but a means\\nIt’s easy to confuse managing money with chasing it. Sure, it’s good to have more than enough money. But, if money is your ultimate goal, you’re managing your personal finances wrong.\\nThere’s no point in saving money if you don’t know what you need it for. This sense of meaninglessness will culminate in you eventually stopping saving and starting to spend mindlessly. We all need to spend our money, but making wise decisions is whats important. You could save up for a car, or a deposit on a house, but unless you consciously put that money aside, it’s all too easy to spend it frivolously.\\nAlthough maintaining personal finances is not about saving as much as possible. Personal finances is about living the life you want.\\nThe value of money is only in what you can do with it. If someone’s goal is to have a stash of ten million dollars, that is an empty goal. What would you like to do with that money? Set goals for yourself based on the reasons you need to save money, not saving money for money’s sake.\\nIn short, money should not be the main goal. You shouldn’t sit around in a job you hate so you can save up bits of paper so you can retire one day and finally relax. You should use your money in a way that allows you to have more of what you love in your life. That means you need to save up a little so you can plan for emergencies, but make sure you put some aside for the fun parts of life.\\nPersonal finance is more about thinking than maths\\nOf course, there are basic rules of finance:\\n- Spend less than you earn\\n- Pay off loans\\n- Invest money so that it generates income\\nRules are important, but they don’t tell the whole story of personal finance. After all, personal finances are personal. And that means that sometimes you can and should break the rules and do what’s right for you. More than maths and rules, personal finance is about behaviour: your habits, thinking, and actions.\\nI could even argue that you should focus more on your behavior than on the rules. You can read about the best ways to pay off your credit, but if you’re not serious about it, you probably never will.\\nPeople often don’t manage their finances because they supposedly don’t care about money. But, oddly enough, that’s the reason they should be doing it. If you don’t like to think about money, the best way to do it is to make sure you set up a system to manage it properly. Yes, dealing with personal finances means dealing with money. You have to learn to control them so you can focus on the aspects of life that interest you.',\n",

       " 'Anyone can develop eczema, no matter your age. It can start out as a red patch that is itchy, probably on your knees, neck, or elbows. Living with eczema can be a real challenge. Another name for eczema is atopic dermatitis. Symptoms include red patches or darker patches of skin, redness, itchiness, and more.\\nIt turns out that aloe vera can be good and one of the best solutions for treating eczema and providing relief from symptoms. Massaging aloe vera on your skin can provide immediate relief. Aloe vera happens to be helpful where a lot of different skin disorders are concerned, and it is regularly recommended by holistic doctors.\\nAbout Aloe Vera\\nAloe vera is an edible succulent plant often used as décor both indoors and out that produces a gel and latex underneath its skin that is yellowish in color. It can also be used for medicinal purposes, including to treat eczema, psoriasis, sunburns, and even frostbite! Latex from the aloe vera plant is a great laxative with no adverse side effects. You can also use aloe vera as a makeup remover and to treat minor burns.\\nHow Does Aloe Vera Treat Eczema?\\nThere is a gel inside the leaves of aloe vera that can be extracted to treat eczema and psoriasis and so much more. Eczema often causes skin inflammation that is itchy, but aloe vera is anti-inflammatory, so most people see relief in as little as 24 hours when using it.\\nAloe vera has been used since ancient times as a great moisturizer because it prevents the skin from losing moisture and hydrates at the same time. Weather changes, eating a food you are allergic to, or coming into contact with certain materials can all cause a flare-up of eczema. But aloe vera for eczema can calm down that irritating flare-up almost immediately.\\nWhile aloe vera is not a cure for eczema or other skin disorders it can make living with these conditions more tolerable and lead to fewer symptoms and flare-ups.\\nHow to Use Aloe Vera for Eczema\\nThere are so many ways you can use aloe vera for eczema but below are some of our favorite methods.\\nAloe Vera and Rosewater\\nYou will need 1 tablespoon of rose water and 1 tablespoon of aloe vera. Mix the two ingredients together to form a type of paste before applying to the area of skin that is affected. Leave on the skin for ten minutes before washing it off with cold water. You can repeat this method twice a day for relief.\\nAloe Vera and Fuller’s Earth\\nYou will need 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon fuller’s earth, and you can use 1 teaspoon of milk or rosewater. You mix the ingredients into a paste and slather it onto the affected skin. Leave it on the skin for 15 minutes and then use a clean, wet cloth to wipe it off. You can use this aloe vera for eczema method daily.\\nAloe Vera, Coconut Oil, and Turmeric\\nYou will need 1 teaspoon of coconut oil, 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel, and 1 teaspoon of turmeric. Mix the turmeric and aloe vera together well before adding liquid coconut oil. Apply the paste to the affected skin and let it stay there for 10 minutes before washing it off with cold water. This is a very effective method for treating eczema and psoriasis.\\nAloe Vera and Banana\\nYou will need one banana and 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel. Mix the banana and aloe vera gel in a blender. Apply to the affected skin and leave for 10 minutes before washing it off with lukewarm water. Do this daily to provide nourishment to your skin.\\nAloe vera has many uses and one of the best uses is for eczema and other skin disorders. These methods are proven to improve life with eczema and provide relief from the symptoms.\\nGet Relief from Frustrating Skin Problems\\nWhen it comes to finding a good, natural soap we have taken the hard work out of the search - our natural bar soaps were designed by eczema sufferers but are ideal for all skin types!

       " 'Today’s freakout comes to us from the comments section of the The Washington Post piece “Amicus brief on empirical data about school vouchers”. The article itself explains Douglas County, Colorado’s school voucher pilot program, which allows up to 500 students (out of 66,000 in the district) to receive an education voucher.\\nThe ACLU of Colorado sued to stop the voucher program, won in state district court, and lost in the Colorado Court of Appeals. Now, the Colorado Supreme Court will hear the case.\\nAlso discussed in the article were responses to the claims made in amicus briefs filed by opponents of school choice programs, including the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. Ultimately, the comments section was full of spirited discussion of how people personally would determine the program’s constitutionality. This post caught our attention:\\nFirst, it’s important to know that the Douglas County School Board created the pilot voucher program. The board members, who were elected by voters in their district to represent the needs of the community, were confident in the quality of their public schools for most kids, but recognized some students are bound to learn better in a different educational setting.\\nOne of Mr. Lathrop’s main concerns was whether every student, no matter what school they choose to attend, is eligible to use a voucher. The Douglas County voucher program is actually one of the most equitable in the country as far as eligibility goes. For the program law’s jurisdiction, which is only Douglas County, every student who attends a public school is eligible for a voucher. Students who are already enrolled in private school are not eligible.\\nPublic school students cannot get voucher funds to use for their education if they remain in a public school, however. If that were to happen, those students would be double-funded – once in public school per-pupil funding and once in the form of voucher dollars – while the students who used their vouchers to attend an independent school would be half as funded as students in public schools. So to clarify, vouchers are not extra money people get to use on top of what the state funds district schools. They are a device for distributing existing education funds differently.\\nTo understand the way the program works now, imagine every public school student in the district gets a “voucher.” The kids who stay enrolled in their public school? Their vouchers go to their public school of choice. The kids who switch to an independent school? Their vouchers, which are worth less money than kids who stay in public school, go to their independent school of choice. If a dollar amount is a measure of how much education one receives, the Douglas County voucher program actually does not incentivize people to attend private schools.\\nThis concept brings us to Mr. Lathrop’s next concern – that the program’s main purpose is to give private schools money and create a cycle of tuition inflation at the expense of taxpayers.\\nTo say, “No, the purpose of the program is to help kids who are struggling in their zoned public school to get the best education for their needs,” isn’t enough to dispute Mr. Lathrop’s claim. So let’s follow his logic to see what would really be likely to happen.\\nIf private schools were to raise tuition rates in direct response to vouchers, they run the huge risk of losing the families who already pay out of pocket. Worse even, if they raise rates too far above the value of a voucher, the families who need the financial assistance of a voucher won’t be able to afford to make up the difference to attend their schools anyway. So where will those students go? They’ll be forced to attend the cheaper option, which will almost certainly be their tuition-free public school. Then, all parties are back at square one…only private schools would be worse off because they would have lost potential voucher student enrollment and some of their existing non-voucher students.\\nAgain, even if the Douglas County voucher program were private school-centric (which it’s not), inflating tuition rates simply would not be in the best interest of private schools. That is probably why, in our experience, we’ve seen most private school leaders accept the voucher amount as a student’s tuition fee, offer additional financial aid, or work with parents to set a feasible payment plan for any leftover fees.\\nIn the end, school voucher programs, especially one led by the public school district itself, are hardly anti-public school. Neither is the district attempting to isolate itself from students from neighboring towns by implementing an optional voucher program. Douglas County actually allows open enrollment among their public schools, so students from outside their district can attend their schools. But ultimately, the Douglas County School Board only has jurisdiction over the students who live in Douglas County. If the answer to making the voucher program more inclusive were creating a statewide voucher program that is open for students from all districts to use their voucher flexibly at any type of school or educational service – public, charter, private, virtual, blended, home, or otherwise – we’d be thrilled!\\nAnd if you think that’s a more fair way of doing things, then you might have just realized you are, in fact, a school choice supporter.',\n",

It was their allegation that an ambulance was \"denied\" to him by the authorities which is what led to his death. They claimed that the student was not provided with an ambulance since he was not a hostel resident. They also alleged that the AIIMS authorities were not providing hostel accommodation to paramedical students.\\nAnurag Kumar, Treasurer of OSA, who was present at the meeting with the Dean of the institute, along with other officials on August 22, said that their main demand regarding the provision of hostel accommodation that was earlier mentioned in the prospectuses of batches before 2020, has now been accepted. “Even legal action was going to be taken against us for protesting but that has also been withdrawn by the administration,” he added.\\nOne of the other demands of the students was to provide monetary compensation to the family of Abhishek Malviya. The institute, in its letter, agreed to the demand and stated that they would submit a proposal to the competent authority for consideration.\\nStudents who were involved in the protest had also expressed concern that they would lose out on attendance during this period. However, Kumar said that the administration has assured them that it would be compensated with extra working hours. Additionally, the institute also approved the grant of vacation.\\nHere is a quick rundown of the students’ demands:\\n1. Monetary compensation to Abhishek Malviya’s family\\n2. Hostel accommodation for students who have opted for Optometry\\n3. Compensation of attendance for period of absence during protest\\n4. Withdraw show cause notices issued to members of OSA\\n5.

Unfortunately, drivers continue to use their cell phones on the road despite increasing awareness of the dangers presented by texting while driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Association, cell phone use while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car crashes in 2017 in the United States.\\nIf you were recently involved in an accident with a texting driver, a well-versed Bohemia texting while driving accident lawyer might be able to recover financial compensation for your damages. Consider talking to a qualified car crash attorney about your case.\\nThe Liability of Texting Drivers in Bohemia\\nLicensed drivers behind the wheel of a motor vehicle owe a duty of care to others who share the road with them, which means they must act with reasonable caution at all times. This includes not texting or otherwise using a cell phone while driving, and doing so could constitute a breach of that duty of care. A driver who breaches this duty and subsequently causes an accident may be held civilly liable for any resulting injuries and damages. For more information about establishing liability, contact a seasoned lawyer.\\nWith the help of a Bohemia texting while driving attorney, a civil plaintiff may be able to pursue compensation for a variety of damages. Among other losses both economic and non-economic in nature, a defendant found liable for causing an accident could owe financial compensation to the plaintiff for:\\n- Medical bills\\n- Lost wages\\n- Rehabilitation expenses\\n- Pain and suffering\\n- Loss of enjoyment of life\\nPotential Plaintiff Liability\\nAs per New York Civil Practice Law & Rules §1411, civil plaintiffs could be subject to pure comparative fault depending on the circumstances of their accident. Under this law, a plaintiff who is partially liable for causing the accident that injured them can still recover damages, but their compensation would be reduced by their percentage of fault.\\nEven if the defendant was texting at the time of the accident or shortly before, the court may also consider the actions of the plaintiff if the defense requests for it to do so. For example, if the accident victim was operating their vehicle above the posted speed limit or failed to yield the right-of-way, the court could find that both the plaintiff and the defendant bear liability for the accident.\\nHowever, the court can only take the possibility of plaintiff liability into consideration if the defendant specifically brings it up. Plaintiffs in Bohemia who believe they may bear some liability in their accident should consult with a texting while driving accident lawyer about maximizing their recoverable compensation.\\nContact a Bohemia Texting While Driving Accident Attorney\\nHiring an attorney to help represent your legal rights and interests could be the best choice you could make when it comes to effectively seeking financial recovery through civil litigation.

It will also capture energy from braking like a traditional hybrid and feature an on-board engine as a backup generator to send power to the battery on trips over 40 miles.\\nEnvironmental advocates have pushed for the development of such \"plug-in\" vehicles to cut oil consumption and vehicle emissions. The technology could also help GM meet higher federal fuel economy standards, representatives have said.\\nLutz said GM engineers were working on how to smooth the power handoff from the Volt\\'s battery to the on-board engine, something designed to kick in as the battery is depleted.\\n\"It all works real well, it\\'s just that the transition from battery power to the internal combustion,\" Lutz said. \"They said it\\'s still noisy and it\\'s a little rough. But heck, we\\'ve got a little more than a year and a half to work on that.\"\\nWhen asked, Lutz said GM was near naming a supplier for the closely watched contract, but declined to comment further.\\nToyota has said it will start producing lithium ion batteries through a joint venture with Japan\\'s Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd in 2009. The automaker, which has eclipsed GM as the world\\'s largest by sales volume, plans to roll out a plug-in hybrid for fleet customers in 2010.\\nBut Lutz said Toyota deserved more scrutiny for its earlier, apparent dismissal of lithium-ion battery technology at the time GM announced the Volt a year and a half ago.\\n\"They told the world that GM was taking a huge risk, that lithium ion batteries were prone to explode and that we were putting our customers at risk and that they would stay with the tried and true,\" he said. \"When it comes to Toyota, let me tell you, the press has a short memory.\"',\n",

And I thought it might be nice to post a few pictures to give you an idea of what I’m talking about here.\\nHowever, you should understand that these are just random photos of flowers by someone who knows absolutely nothing about the subject. And therefore I’m using the term ‘flower‘ quite freely here: I tend to lump together everything in the same category (here referred to as ‘flowers‘), whether they’re actual flowers, trees or something else.\\nSo, why is it that I know nothing about plants? Well, as far as so-called wild flowers are concerned (or trees / hay etc), I’m probably allergic to all of them and tend to avoid them. And gardening, well, I live in a flat with a huge balcony and couldn’t be bothered with flower boxes. The balcony faces south and gets extremely hot in summer, so any plants would just get scorched. That’s my excuse, anyway. Although how my neighbours manage to make their plants thrive is a bit of a mystery to me… In my defence, I have, on occasion, over several years, tried to grow some potted plants (or flowers, cactuses, whatever).

Maybe the pandemic brought this awareness on early. One thought has dominated my thoughts: you have limited time, limited paths and adventures, limited experiences and emotions to feel. Will you continue your life as it is, slowly floating down the lazy-river of milestones—college, job, wedding, kids, retirement, death—or will you dive into the icy water and swim somewhere unknown?\\n“Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” ~ Mary Oliver\\nOnce you’ve had the realization that your journey is ending sometime between now and 50 years from now, the lens becomes black and white. The little voice in your head ramps up the tension: stay with the safe path you’ve chosen, or move to Costa Rica and start a sloth sanctuary? Dream within the current structure of your life, or scare yourself with bigger, grander visions of what your life could be?\\nThe questions that arise can be alarming:\\n>> Will I ever fall in love again?\\n>> Will I ever travel somewhere and have an adventure by myself?\\n>> Will I ever fulfill my potential in my career?\\n>> Will I reach self-actualization and stop doubting myself once and for all?\\n>> Will I make enough of an impact on this world?\\n>> Will I write my book?\\n>> Will I have enough time alone?\\nThe minutes begin to tick, the second-hand tapping in your ear, and a message flashes across your mind at least once a day: you are wasting time!\\nThe urgency to take action builds. But instead of a corvette or paragliding, I imagine a career change, a tiny house, and possibly a meditation retreat.\\nI imagine doing more of what I want, and less of what everyone else wants.\\nI think about my grandmother, who was widowed early and had 25 years to herself. People used to ask her if she wanted to get remarried. She would smile like a Cheshire cat and reply, “Why would I do that? I am only responsible for myself now.” She had the resources to travel and eat out with friends and take in a Broadway show—that was her reward for a dutiful life. She wouldn’t have had it any other way, but what if she hadn’t outlived my grandfather?\\nA woman’s midlife crisis isn’t about wanting to be younger. It is about wanting more time with herself, to live from a selfish place, one that isn’t populated with the needs of others.\\nIt is about getting to know herself deeply, authentically, outside of the confines of her many roles. It is about reconnecting with a part of herself—the part that is Untamed, to quote Glennon Doyle, and free—that she may not have touched since adolescence.\\nA midlife crisis is rooted in what we’ve had to give up, to put away for another time. For men, maybe it is their sexual prowess—that vital energy that makes them feel young and invincible. For women, it is their authentic, unadulterated sense of self, untethered from others’ expectations. Perhaps, if somehow, we could allow those parts to filter through along the way, we wouldn’t need to blow everything up to find them again later.\\nOr perhaps, that is the beauty of a midlife crisis: to start again, reclaiming what was once ours.',\n",

       " 'The planning and provision of care for older people in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) communities is an increasing challenge to traditional welfare systems. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of the newly implemented Care Act 2014 in England for developing an anti-discriminatory approach.\\nThe review draws on existing research and conceptual literature to identify how key provisions of the new act can be interpreted in light of current knowledge.\\nOverall the provisions of the Care Act lend themselves well to positive interpretation in relation to the needs of older LGBT people and their support networks. A potential tension, however, arises in the locality focus of the legislation that could constrain good practice with geographically dispersed communities. There is also a need to challenge both heteronormative and ageist assumptions that lead to older LGBT people remaining unrecognised.\\nApplied with imagination and commitment, the provisions of the new act could enable new forms of person-centred care to emerge to support older LGBT people.\\nSocial workers are in a key position to influence how the Care Act is interpreted and applied in practice and can act as change agents for a societal move towards older LGBT people having greater choice and control over their well-being.\\nThis review presents examples of how the provisions of the legislation can be utilised to support positive change for older LGBT people.\\nCrossland, J.

       " \"Technological advancements in MDEF is a key factor driving market revenue growth\\nMarket Size – USD 10.20 Billion in 2022, Market Growth – at a CAGR of 8.0%, Market Trends – Rising awareness among end users about environmental benefits of Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) in reducing harmful emissions\\nVancouver, B.C., June 23, 2023 - The global Marine Diesel Exhaust Fluid (MDEF) market size is expected to reach USD 22.12 Billion in 2032 and register a steady revenue CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period, according to latest analysis by Emergen Research. Rising awareness among end users about environmental benefits of DEF in reducing harmful emissions is a key factor driving market revenue growth. DEFs stands out as an eco-conscious alternative due to the transformative impact of the product on harmful emissions, converting the fluids into nitrogen and water. In contrast, diesel fuel releases hazardous Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions, which contribute to acid rain and the greenhouse effect. DEF, primarily composed of 67.5% de-ionized water and 32.5% urea (also known as carbamide), serves as an environment-friendly substance. Urea enhances non-toxic properties and maintains a potential of Hydrogen (pH)-neutral nature. Notably, urea enables impressive ability to bind with specific substances, particularly nitrogen.\\nHowever, scarcity of DEF and global increase in urea prices are key factors, which could restrain market revenue growth. DEF, a combination of urea and water, is injected into exhaust stream of vehicles, which plays a vital role in reducing nitrous oxide emissions from diesel engines. According to the World Bank, by October 2022, there will be a 70% reduction in ammonia output in Europe, which has led to shortages of diesel exhaust fluid in key countries. Moreover, supply concerns, export issues, trade restrictions, and production shortages in Europe along with disruptions caused by sanctions against Russia and Belarus, as well as trade limitations in China, are other factors, which could restrain market revenue growth.\\nSome Key Highlights From the Report\\nOn 24 April 2023, Sun Coast Resources, one of the country's preeminent leaders in fuel, lubricants, DEF distribution, and emergency response solutions, partnered with RelaDyne, the country's largest lubricant distributor and market leader in fuel, Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), and industrial reliability services. The merger of Sun Coast with RelaDyne significantly increases RelaDyne's market share and geographic coverage in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and the Carolinas.\\nThe large commercial vehicles segment is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global MDEF market over the forecast period. This is due to stringent emission regulations implemented by governments and regulatory bodies on a global scale. These regulations mandate the use of DEF and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems to effectively reduce Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines. SCR systems utilize DEF to initiate a chemical reaction that converts harmful NOx emissions into nitrogen and water vapor, which are less harmful. Furthermore, increasing adoption of SCR technology in large commercial vehicles and rising implementation of SCR technology are also expected to drive revenue growth of this segment during the forecast period.\\nThe Selective Catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts segment is expected to register steadily fast revenue growth rate in the global MDEF market over the forecast period. This is because SCR technology possesses the capacity to effectively reduce levels of harmful nitrogen oxide in exhaust gases from diesel engines, surpassing requirements set by IMO Tier III emission regulations (3.4 g/kWh and lower). Over the past three decades, SCR has proven to be a reliable and readily available technology in the market. This technology has been successfully implemented across a diverse range of engine and vessel types, operating under various engine settings and utilizing fuels with different sulfur contents. The industry's supply chains supporting SCR are highly competitive and well-established.\\nThe Asia Pacific market is expected to account for largest revenue share in the global MDEF market during the forecast period. This is attributed to increasing activities by key market players in countries in this region. For example, Indian Oil has formed a partnership with Cummins Technologies India Pvt. Limited to facilitate the bulk distribution of Indian Oil’s Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF), commercially known as IOC ClearBlue, in modern engines equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems. Practice of bulk DEF dispensing aligns with global patterns and offers enhanced economic feasibility to truck and bus operators compared to packaged supplies. This collaboration enables provision of a top-notch product to clients countrywide by leveraging Cummins technological expertise alongside Indian Oil's proficiency in bulk dispensing.\\nSome major companies in the global market report include Yara International ASA, BASF SE, Shell plc., Totalenergies SE, Mitsui Chemicals, Inc., Valvoline Cummins Private Limited, CF Industries Holdings, Inc., ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Gulf Oil Lubricants India Ltd., and Cummins Inc.\",\n",

       " 'Being bullied is not an easy thing to cope with. Bullying can leave kids feeling helpless, vulnerable, and confused. Consequently, when kids are bullied, they are often so shocked by bullying that they are not sure what to do. But this indecision and lack of response can open the door to more bullying. Make sure your kids are prepared should the situation ever occur.\\nHow Your Child Can Deal With a Bully\\nTo keep bullies from harassing your kids, make sure they know what to do if confronted by a bully. Aside from developing their assertiveness skills, building their self-esteem and improving their social skills, they also need practical tools on how to handle bullying situations. Here are seven ideas that any child can implement.\\nIgnore the bully. Not reacting when someone says or does something hurtful is often the most effective response to bullying. Most bullies are looking for a reaction. They want the target to get angry or cry. And, if your child has an emotional response to bullying, it often continues and may even escalate. Conversely, if your child keeps on walking with his head held high every time someone engages in name-calling or any other type of bullying, the bully will eventually move on when he realizes he will not get a response from your child.\\nTell the bully to stop. Again, bullies often do not expect someone to stand up to them. In fact, they often target kids they believe they can intimidate. As a result, telling a bully to stop in a strong and confident voice can be very effective. In fact, bullies often count on finding a victim who will not say anything at all. But if your child makes sure the bully knows he cannot walk all over him, the bully is more likely to stop what he is doing.\\nMake a joke or agree with the bully. Some kids are naturally funny and find it easy to laugh right along with the bully. When kids are able to do this, it demonstrates that they are confident about who they are; and it does not bother them if other people point out their flaws. In fact, they are often secure enough to laugh right along with the bully. When your child laughs with the bully, it diffuses any power the bully thought he had over your child, and his bullying methods become ineffective.\\nAvoid bullying hot spots. Sometimes all it takes to prevent bullying is to avoid places where bullies hang out. These bullying hot spots include areas like the far corners of the playground, vacant hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, and the back of the bus. Be sure your child knows where these spots are located and that he avoids them or travels with a buddy when he can. Sometimes the best way to deter bullying is to avoid crossing paths with the bully.\\nStick with friends. Bullies usually look for kids who are alone or socially isolated. Be sure your child knows that hanging out with friends is a great way to prevent bullying. If your child struggles with social skills or has very few friends, take steps to help him develop friendships. Having just one healthy friendship can go a long way in protecting your child from bullies.\\nKnow how to get out of a bullying situation. Talk to your child about ways in which he can defend himself against bullies, especially if the bullying is physical. For instance, be sure your child knows to keep his eye on the exit and to use it when the opportunity presents itself. Other options include making a lot of noise, attracting attention, and knowing how to deflect any type of physical aggression. Your child does not have to “fight” the bully to defend himself. He just needs to know how to diffuse the situation and get to safety.\\nReport the bullying to an adult. Be sure your child knows that the best way to prevent bullying is to report it. Without adult intervention, bullying often will continue or escalate. Talk about the reasons why kids don’t tell others they are being bullied and be sure your children know that you understand their fears. Stress that while it takes a lot of strength and courage to report bullying, it is the smartest way to handle this type of situation. Also be careful not to engage in victim-blaming or to criticize your child for getting bullied. Bullying is a choice made by the bully and never the responsibility of the victim.',\n",

And many wonder, ironically or maybe not, after survived to a pandemic will I die for an asteroid? Between pandemics and distructions for a meteor impact, which will be the apocalypse that will affect the Earth in this fatal year? We are talking about OR2, an asteroid potentially dangerous that will pass by the earth in a few days. But don’t worry, it’s only another problem that will face the humanity this year and the NASA reassures us: the asteroid will pass by the Earth, but it won’t touch it.\\nWho is OR2, the asteroid that will pass by the Earth in a few days?\\nThere are about 758.000 catalogued asteroids that pass next to the Earth, 1900 of them are considered potentially dangerous for it. OR2 is one of them.\\nOR2 was discovered in the 1998 and it was promptly put between the ones potentially dangerous. This because it had some characteristics. It has a diameter of about one kilometers and a half and to be considered dangerous it must be bigger than 140-150 meters. So it’s over this characteristic.\\nAnother characteristic that it must have to be considered potentially dangerous it’s about its orbit. It is between the ones that get closer than 7.5 million of kilometers to the Earth.\\nOR2, in its minor distance, will pass by the Earth of 6 million of kilometers. But we don’t have to be worry neither, because, as the NASA reassures, 6 million of kilometers means about 16 times the distance Earth-Moon. In the past many asteroid get much closer than how much OR2 will do, but these were even much smaller.\\nThe observation of OR2\\nSure, all these reassurances make not all relaxed. And the biggest part of who waits for the passage of the asteroid will remain with the bated breath at least until the 30th of april, when the crisis will be averted.\\nThis close passage is, instead, reason of study for many astronomers. OR2 will be observable with telescope even really small and even with simple binoculars, as well as many instruments, like radars, optical and thermic appliances.\\nThe usage of all these instruments, for the whole time during which the asteroid will pass very close to the planet Earth, will allow to understand many secrets of it. Like more detailed measurements, physical property, rotation, percentage of light that it reflects from the sun, etc.\\nCurrently the size, even if we know that they are considerable, are still included in a too large range: between 1,8 and 4,1 kilometers. The Observatory of Arecibo, in Puerto Rico, discovered already that it has a diameter of at least one kilometer and half, but these close observations will allow to do more precise calculations.\\nHere you have how to see the asteroid\\nNo destruction, so. Only a lot of tension and a lot of emotion for the close passage of a such big asteroid. But can we see it?\\nIn the period of maximum approach of the asteroid it will visible even from Italy. It will be the night between the 28th and the 29th of april, while the best time will be between the 21.30 and the 22.00, even if it will be visible for almost all the night.\\nThe position that it will occupy in the sky will be at 25 degree at south-west, between the stars of the Hydra and the constellation of the Lion. To see it it will be enough a small telescope or a great binocular.\\nAn occasion that we can’t miss, because the next time that OR2 will come back to visit us it will be in the 2079. Even if in that case the “don’t worry” will be fewer, because it will pass only 1,8 million of kilometers away. But we still have 59 years to think about it.\\nThis post is also available in: Italiano',\n",

       " 'It is the goal of the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario to work with others to create schools, communities, and a society free from all forms of individual and systemic discrimination. To further this goal, ETFO defines equity as fairness achieved through proactive measures, which results in equality, promotes diversity, and fosters respect and dignity for all.\\nETFO’s Equity Initiatives\\nETFO is a union committed to social justice, equity, and inclusion. The Federation’s commitment to these principles is reflected in the initiatives it has established as organizational priorities, such as: ETFO’s multi-year strategy on anti-Black racism; two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning education; and addressing First Nations, Métis, and Inuit issues. ETFO establishes its understanding of these issues within an anti-oppressive framework. The Federation ensures its work incorporates the voices and experiences of marginalized communities, addresses individual and systemic inequities, and supports ETFO members as they strive for equity and social justice in their professional and personal lives. Using the anti-oppressive framework is one of the ways that ETFO is operationalizing its Equity Statement.\\nDefinition of An Anti-Oppressive Framework\\nAn anti-oppressive framework is the method and process in which we understand how systems of oppression such as colonialism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, and ableism can result in individual discriminatory actions and structural/systemic inequalities for certain groups in society. Anti oppressive practices and goals seek to recognize and dismantle such discriminatory actions and power imbalances. Anti oppressive practices and this framework should seek to guide the Federation’s work with an aim to identify strategies and solutions to deconstruct power and privilege in order to mitigate and address the systemic inequalities that often operate simultaneously and unconsciously at the individual, group, and institutional or union level.',\n",

The Zl1 billion ($410.8 million) transaction with a weighted average life of 2.8 years was the first international asset-backed issue from central and eastern Europe this year. Although pricing on the private placement was not publicly disclosed, Georg Feldscher, head of strategic portfolio management at Raiffeisen International in Vienna, says that it was in line with pricing on public transactions that emerged before the asset-backed market in central and eastern Europe was effectively closed down last summer on the back of the fallout from the problems in the US sub-prime mortgage market. \"If you are a prime and acknowledged originator of assets there is no central and eastern European pricing premium,\" says Feldscher, adding that Raiffeisen Leasing Polska has been offering vehicle leases for more than 10 years.',\n",

Yield curve flattening vs. steepening. These are the prosaic questions fixed-income investors have to ask in the light of the GSE (Government Sponsored Entities) crisis and of other evidence of the strangling effect of the mounting credit squeeze on the US economy and, consequently, on the rest of the world. Let us first, however, add our thoughts to the many comments written about the crisis surrounding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\\nThe GSE problem is about both liquidity and solvency. The US Administration is focusing its immediate efforts on solving the liquidity problem, but is still coy about whether its guaranty of GSE debt is implicit or explicit. Many commentators take the implicit guaranty for granted and as sufficient to bring back the GSEs’ credit worthiness (as measured by CDS) to the official AAA rating each GSE carries. We are a little sceptical and wonder what the Asian central banks are thinking after buying agency bonds in recent years to receive a touch more than Treasuries.

I treat people fairly and kindly – they treat me fairly and kindly back. Most people are like this – but not everyone.

These are the words he wants to make known,” lawyer Cedric Moisse told reporters in Brussels.\\nAbdeslam’s arrest was considered a rare success in Belgium’s anti-terror fight, although he was found within a short distance of his family home in the Molenbeek district of the capital. He has refused to talk since the Brussels bombings.\\nThe transfer to France should happen “within 10 days”, said French justice minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas.\\nBelgian investigators will still be allowed to question Abdeslam in France.\\nHe is believed to have acted as a logistics coordinator for the Paris attacks and has told investigators he was meant to carry out a suicide bombing at the Stade de France stadium but backed out.\\n– Police concerns at airport –\\nBrussels airport, closed since its departure hall was wrecked in the attacks, said it had received the go-ahead from fire services and the Belgian Civil Aviation Authority “for a partial restart of passenger flights”.\\n“The airport is thus technically ready for a restart,” it said in a statement. “However, the authorities have yet to take a formal decision on the restart date. Until Friday evening, no passenger flights will take place at Brussels Airport.”\\nIn a bid to end the travel chaos caused by the closure of a major European air hub, hundreds of staff staged drills this week to test temporary check-in facilities as well as enhanced security measures.\\nUnder the temporary arrangements, Zaventem airport would be able to handle 800 departing passengers per hour — around 20 percent of normal capacity, it said.\\nAdding to the airport’s woes, police unions threatened to go on strike if security measures are not improved ahead of the reopening.\\nAlso Thursday, Portugal stepped up security at its airports following a message purportedly from the Islamic State group threatening attacks on Lisbon.\\n“Necessary security measures have been taken, including at airports,” said Helena Fazenda, head of the country’s internal security force, after the non-authenticated message was circulated on social media.\\n– Jihadist web –\\nClose links have emerged between the Paris and Brussels attackers, exposing a tangled web of cross-border extremist cells and triggering a series of raids and arrests in several European countries.\\nIn the latest operation on Thursday, police and soldiers searched a wooded area in western Belgium, with authorities saying the raid was linked to a thwarted plot to attack France.\\nThe main suspect in that case, Reda Kriket, has been charged in France with membership of a terrorist organisation after police found an arsenal of weapons and explosives at his home.\\nThe joint French-Belgian operation by masked police and soldiers along a busy motorway lasted for several hours but Belgian prosecutors said no weapons or explosives were found and no arrests were made.\\nBelgian-born French citizen Abdeslam has connections to at least two of the Brussels bombers. Khalid El Bakraoui, who blew himself up at the metro, rented a flat in Brussels where Abdeslam’s fingerprints were found.\\nOne of the two airport bombers, Najim Laachraoui, drove to Hungary with Abdeslam in September.\\nBelgium is still searching for a suspected third attacker, the so-called “man in the hat” seen in surveillance images alongside the two airport bombers.\\nWith no suspects in custody over the attacks, police appealed for possible images taken by members of the public.',\n",

Helps in weight loss\\nAs kiwi has high fiber content, it facilitates weight loss. Its low glycemic index prevents the rush of insulin, unlike other fruits which have high sugar content. The kiwifruit prevents storage of fat. It also prevents cravings as it makes you feel full for a longer time. Therefore, it is extremely beneficial for shedding the excess fat. If you want to lose weight healthily, you should start having kiwi fruit regularly.\\n12. Prevents premature aging\\nOne of the popular health benefits of kiwi fruit is that it has anti-aging properties. As the fruit contains powerful antioxidants, it can prevent premature aging. The antioxidants present in the fruit prevent free radical damage that accelerates the process of aging. The kiwifruit has a great combination of Vitamin E, Vitamin C, and lycopene. This combination can fight free radicals effectively and delay signs of aging such as fine lines and wrinkles. If you have kiwi fruit regularly, your skin will stay firm for a longer time. The kiwi fruit oil is used as one of the main ingredients in anti-aging products.\\n13. Protects skin from UV rays\\nKiwifruit can protect your skin from the harmful UV rays of the sun. As kiwis are rich in Vitamin E, they can prevent skin degeneration and skin cancer. Apart from protecting the skin from UV rays, kiwi fruit can also heal cuts and abrasions. As the fruit is rich in Vitamin C, it can repair the skin.\\n14. Prevents hair loss\\nIf you want to have luxuriant hair, you should incorporate kiwi fruit into your diet. Kiwi fruit is rich in Vitamin C which plays a vital role in collagen formation. Collagen prevents hair from breaking and splitting. As the fruit protects the body from free radical damage, it prevents stress that can lead to hair loss. The Vitamin E in kiwi fruit also improves hair growth.\\n15. Good for bone health\\nAs kiwifruit is rich in Vitamin K, it is good for bone health. Vitamin K improves the absorption of calcium and decreases urinary excretion of the mineral. It also prevents bone-related disorders such as osteoporosis. The Vitamin C in kiwifruit is beneficial for the health of connective tissues. It keeps your bones, gums, and teeth healthy. Vitamin C is responsible for collagen formation that helps in maintaining the integrity of bone tissues.\\nThus, you can see that there are plenty of health benefits of kiwi fruit. The exotic taste and vibrant green color of the fruit attract many people. But the uniqueness of kiwi fruit lies in its nutritional value and enormous health benefits. You can eat the fruit in its raw form or make a smoothie. People love adding this green fruit to their salads. If you want to retain the high Vitamin C content of kiwi fruit, do not cook it. Many people also take kiwifruit as a supplement. The supplements can be in a capsule, tablet, or powder form. They are made from kiwi extract.',\n",

       " 'If you Google “How to Hire a Financial Advisor,” you’ll find thousands of articles, tons of advice and a plethora of opinions.\\nThe main theme of all of the articles seems to guide consumers to hire a CFP and they should be fee-only. Those two criteria may be a great fit for you or it might not be…it depends on the advisor.\\nThe other piece of advice almost every article provides is a list of the questions they feel you should ask while interviewing the advisor.\\nThis is a bad idea in our opinion because it takes the advisor off the hook. It would be pretty easy to give you the answer he or she feels you want to hear and frankly, you’d probably never know the difference from one advisor to the next.\\nThat’s why we developed this formula, so that anyone can interview a financial advisor and easily be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. The very first thing to understand is that you are listening for what the advisor doesn’t say, just as much as you are listening to what he or she does say during your first appointment.\\nVery good advisors will have a process they utilize for every meeting. Which means they know what they are going to say, they have rehearsed what they are going to say, and they plan to deliver their very best effort because they know there may not be a second meeting unless you are impressed and feel comfortable with them.\\nWhat the advisor says during the first meeting will encompass their best practices, and their unique abilities. What they say here is what they feel separates them from other advisors. In other words, it’s what they feel is their best stuff.\\nIn other words, If they don’t tell you exactly how they get paid (you should not have to ask), the odds are that you may never know and that’s probably not a good way to start a business relationship.\\nIf the main focus of the conversation is on their investment process and reviewing your investment statements then there is a very large chance that they won’t be helping you to understand your estate plan or whether your family will be okay in the event of a premature death because they would have told you about their other areas of expertise or focus.\\nIf there isn’t talk of a financial planning process then it’s probably safe to say they don’t have a comprehensive financial planning process. If your personal net worth is under $500,000 then it may not matter to you if the advisor will be comprehensive or not. If your net worth exceeds $500,000…don’t think twice about it, find a comprehensive financial planner that will integrate all of the areas of your financial plan so that everything is fully coordinated.\\nThey say actions speak louder than words, correct? This next cue to watch for is better than any words the advisor may speak.\\nWhat documents of yours does the planner want to look at prior to taking you on as a new client? If they only ask to see your investment statements there is a good chance that the focus of their practice is on investment management and not financial planning.\\nOn the other hand, if they ask to see your wills and trusts, tax returns and business documents (buy sell agreement or operating agreement), as well as, your investment statements…I’d say there is a much better chance that they will help you with all of those things. Remember, it’s vitally important that your advisor takes a comprehensive approach because of the interactions between all of the areas of your financial life.\\nTax reduction strategies is just as important as investment planning because taxes can erode your returns if you’re not careful. The wrong beneficiary on your IRA or life insurance could change your entire estate plan. Financial planning is complicated and it should always be done in a holistic and comprehensive manner.\\nIf you only did those two things…listen to what they are saying (and not saying) and watching for which documents they ask for, you’ll have an advantage over other consumers looking to hire a new advisor. On the other hand, if you want to hold out for the very best financial planners, then there are three other things that you can do to really know that you are hiring the best fit advisor for your family.\\nIf they don’t offer to do this, I might walk away but you should always get a written engagement proposal. This document should include the advisors initial observations about your financial situation based on the four sets of documents we listed above (wills and trusts, income tax return, buy sell agreement or operating agreement and your investment statements).\\nThink about this is: what if the advisor tells you during the first meeting that they take a comprehensive approach to financial planning? Yet, during the next meeting the engagement proposal they prepared focuses on what they feel is wrong with your investment portfolio. It tells you they probably don’t practice comprehensive financial planning.\\nThe engagement proposal should have several items in each category of planning: estate, personal risk management, tax reduction strategies, investment, retirement and business owner planning.\\nIf the engagement proposal has all of those areas covered then you should expect that a sample financial plan from the advisor would have all of those areas taken care of as well. A sample should be relatively easy for an advisor to produce.\\nAll you have to do is look at the recommendations of the financial plan or at the implementation portion of the plan to see whether the wealth advisor is taking a comprehensive approach to financial planning, or not.\\nThe final thing you want to know is what the financial advisor does during an annual review. Ask to see what they would bring to an annual review.\\nHere again, if the documents are all focused on portfolio returns and your asset allocation, then don’t you think you might be close to hiring an investment advisor? The annual review should include a visual depicting where the client’s present situation is versus the projections that were made in the financial plan.\\nThat’s what you want to hire a financial planner for isn’t it? You want them to help you create a plan and then to review your progress towards your financial goals and objectives. It would be wise to make sure they review your goals and objectives, your estate plan and your business transition plan if you own a company.\\nThat’s it! Look and listen for those five things and you will be heads above anyone else looking to hire a financial advisor, wealth advisor or financial planner.\\nOn another note, there isn’t anything wrong with hiring an investment advisor. It may seem like we are poking at advisors that focus on the investments (okay…maybe a little) but the truth is that your financial life is complicated and you really aren’t doing your family any favors if you find an investment advisor who may lose most of your wealth to income taxes, estate taxes or they die prematurely before they can build their nest egg. Or any other host of issues that can be presented to you over time.\\nHire an advisor that takes a comprehensive approach to financial planning so that they are watching out for all the things that you don’t even know could be an issue.',\n",

       " 'When Omaha-based photographer Geoff Johnson was a child, he would hide silently behind the front door of his house whenever someone came to visit, emerging only after they turned their backs so as to obscure their view of the interior of his house. This, he explains, was one way of coping with his mother’s compulsive hoarding.\\nDuring his childhood and adolescence, Johnson and his sister lived in a house without a working refrigerator, air conditioner, or running water outside of the bathtub, with few places to eat amongst the encroaching debris. For Behind the Door, the photographer returns to that house for the first time in two decades, sifting through and photographing what remains.\\nRevisiting the house for the first time since his departure in 1995, Johnson found the house almost exactly as it had been during his youth, the major difference being its current state of abandonment. Instead of capturing merely the residue of his former home, the photographer traces the lived experience of himself and his sister by casting in their place his son and her daughter, who were edited into the images, as the house was not safe for them to visit in person.\\nAfter years of avoiding the house’s interior, Johnson’s homecoming brought with it a flood of emotions, and at times he was hurled back into the mind of his forgotten self. When a neighbor he recognized approached, he stiffened as he had done a quarter century before. Family pictures lay exposed and unframed on surfaces, and he says, “the fear and vulnerability” stayed with him as he made his way from room to room.\\nJohnson’s re-entrance into the house, he says, has allowed him to reopen—and ultimately to heal— old wounds. Though he is able to access those long-ago memories, he was able to return fortified with the passing of the years. As an adult, he has gathered an understanding of the situation that eluded him as a child. After many conversations with his mother during her lifetime, photographing the home has empowered him to recognize, to heal, and perhaps most of all, to forgive what happened in the past.\\nOccasionally, he and his sister have brought up their childhoods with their own kids, but he admits that for now, they’re too young to grasp it. Johnson isn’t sure how exactly those years marked his growth and the course of his life, except that it has instilled within him a firm idea of what home should be. “My house now is a place I want my kids to feel safe and welcomed,” says the artist.\\nBehind the Door was created in collaboration with digital artist Randy Teet and assistant Jennifer McShea.\\nAll images © Geoff Johnson',\n",

During his tenure, he proposed strategies and oversaw investigations aimed at limiting foreign money laundering threats from accessing the U.S. financial system. Mr. Borrayo led investigations resulting in the successful execution of numerous actions imposed under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act targeting foreign jurisdictions, including DPRK and Iran, and financial institutions, including ABLV Bank. He managed the administration of FinCEN’s special information collection authorities provided to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the Geographic Targeting Order and Foreign Financial Agency regulations. Mr. Borrayo ensured that these efforts contributed to ongoing investigations and advanced the U.S. government’s understanding of current and over the horizon illicit finance threats.\\nAs a seasoned expert in FinCEN’s authorities, Mr. Borrayo was routinely called upon to brief Congressional Committee staff, such as Banking and Foreign Relations, with respect to FinCEN administered authorities used to target foreign illicit finance threats.\\nPrior to his tenure at FinCEN, Mr. Borrayo spent over a decade at the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the Enforcement Division. Starting in 2003, he investigated potential violations of OFAC sanctions programs, and provided guidance to law enforcement on the admissibility of international trade transactions – which contributed to the execution of both OFAC civil enforcement actions and criminal matters.\\nIn 2005, Mr. Borrayo transitioned to OFAC’s Targeting Division where he conducted all source investigations and proposed designation actions related to high priority national security threats. His portfolio included investigations into elaborate nuclear and ballistic missile procurement networks utilized by Iran and DPRK and authoring evidentiary memoranda in support of designation actions issued by OFAC. Mr. Borrayo worked closely with other U.S. government agencies and U.S.-allied governments in support of the multilateralization of certain targeted U.S. sanctions programs. His collaboration contributed to the successful adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions designed to address Iran and the DPRK’s weapons programs. Mr. Borrayo played a pivotal role in informing senior policy makers with regards to key financial vulnerabilities related to foreign adversaries and “over the horizon” threats. His ability to identify these vulnerabilities contributed substantially to Treasury’s successful outreach efforts to isolate Iran’s illicit finance networks. In addition, he made significant contributions in scoping Executive Orders and Congressional laws by enhancing their Targeting utility and ensuring they can be utilized effectively.\\nAs Senior Director of Investigations at Ferrari and Associates, Mr. Borrayo leads efforts in conducting due diligence investigations on a variety of matters.

       " 'Justifiably, the holocaust deserves its place in history as one of mankind’s darkest acts. That a similar treatment of Australia’s indigenous Aboriginal population is not held in the same regard by many, either through ignorance or denial, is something documentary film-maker John Pilger sets out to change with this powerful and revealing portrait of his native country’s history.\\nTaking in a range of various injustices, from the well-documented Stolen Generation travesties through to lesser known acts, such as a Network Broadcaster’s attempts to wrongly demonise a town’s Aboriginal population as paedophiles, Pilger takes no prisoners in his attempt to document some of the country’s changing – and indeed not changing – attitudes towards what it deems its Aboriginal ‘problem’.\\nGet beyond the rather Open University feel then and you’ll find that behind Pilger’s monotonous narration lies a story littered with atrocities and abhorrent behaviour right up to the highest echelons of government. That he doesn’t quite dress it up in the manner that perhaps other documentary makers – think Michael Moore without the gimmicks – might do shouldn’t detract from the powerful message behind the portrayal.\\nManaging to interview some fairly high profile talking heads (recent PM Kevin Rudd among them), Pilger clearly has the clout and the access to lend the documentary some weight. He may lack the charm at times to tease the truth from those in his sights, instead choosing to rile them up, but his passion and dedication to his cause is never in question, despite the consequent entertainment factor his somewhat aggressive questioning delivers.\\nAmidst the various tales of poverty and appalling injustice meted out on the people via stories, recollections and some genuinely shocking CCTV, some of the most disturbing moments bring us bang up to date. Prepare to be astounded as Pilger interviews Australia Day revellers descended from those he feels have ‘invaded’ the country, revealing a shocking ignorance of the scale of the country’s injustices and a casual lack of interest in caring anyway.\\nSo while it’s unlikely Pilger, and indeed Utopia, will be taken up by the Aussie tourist board to accurately portray the country, his scathing indictment of its dark heart deserves recognition for actually doing just that.\\nUTOPIA + John Pilger Q&A – Picturehouse Cinemas UK',\n",
       " \"Screenplay writing is an art, and like any art, it requires skill, patience, and a good dose of creativity. Whether you are a novice or an experienced screenwriter, there are certain dos and don'ts that you should keep in mind to make your screenplay stand out.\\nThe concept is the backbone of your screenplay, so it's important to spend time developing it. Make sure your concept is unique, clear, and compelling enough to grab the attention of your readers. A good concept should be able to convey the theme, tone, and genre of your story in just a few words.\\nOne of the biggest mistakes that screenwriters make is rushing the plotting stage. Plotting is the process of laying out the sequence of events in your story, and it's crucial to get it right.\\nTake your time to brainstorm, research, and develop your plot to ensure that it's well-structured, cohesive, and engaging.\\nCharacters are the heart of your story, so it's important to create those that are well-rounded, relatable, and memorable. Make sure your characters have clear goals, motivations, and flaws that drive the story forward. Avoid creating one-dimensional characters that are merely plot devices.\\nExposition is the information that you provide to the audience to help them understand the story. While exposition is necessary, overusing it can lead to a dull and unengaging story.\\nTry to incorporate exposition naturally into the dialogue and actions of your characters instead of relying on long-winded explanations.\\nScreenplays are a visual medium, so it's important to write visually. Use descriptive language and vivid imagery to help the reader visualize the world you've created. Avoid relying on lengthy descriptions or relying on the camera direction, which can limit the imagination of the reader and the creativity of the director.\\nCliches are overused phrases or ideas that have lost their originality and impact. Avoid using cliches in your screenplay as they can make your story predictable and unoriginal. Instead, strive for originality and creativity to make your story stand out.\\nEditing and rewriting are essential to creating a polished and well-written screenplay. After you've finished your first draft, take a break and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Look for areas that need improvement and refine your writing until it's as clear and concise as possible.\\nFinally, don't be afraid to take risks with your screenplay. The most memorable and impactful stories often take risks and break conventions.\\nWhile it's important to understand the rules of screenwriting, don't be afraid to bend or break them to create a story that is unique and memorable.\",\n",
       " 'The Portland Trail Blazers staged a dramatic comeback on Tuesday night, overcoming a 22-point deficit to secure a 109-104 victory over the Phoenix Suns. This win put an end to their seven-game losing streak, marking a significant turnaround in their performance.\\nDeAndre Ayton was a pivotal figure in this resurgence, delivering a double-double with 16 points and 15 rebounds. Anfernee Simons also played a crucial role, contributing 23 points and seven rebounds.

Brogdon\\'s involvement increased in the second half, replacing Shaedon Sharpe, who left the game due to a groin injury.\\nAnother key to Portland\\'s victory was their proficiency from the 3-point line, hitting 14 of 28 attempts, compared to just five for Phoenix.

       " 'By W.B. King\\nWhen the NCUA amended an existing loan participation rule in October 2022 expanding the ability for credit unions service organizations (CUSOs) to originate all loan types, Origence jumped at the chance to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market.\\nTo this end, Tony Boutelle, president and CEO of the Irvine, Calif.-based Origence, told Finopotamus that in September 2023 the CUSO launched FI Connect.\\n“This was to provide top-of-funnel opportunities to credit unions, allowing them to compete where purchases are being made and financing is decided,” he noted. “We originate the loan, enroll the borrower for membership, and transfer the loan to an eligible credit union partner in real-time, 24/7. The platform is equipped to handle the needs of large national retailers that want affordable lending options.”\\nWhat came next was a partnership with the Austin, Texas-based Tesla, Inc., which allowed FI Connect to offer credit union financing to EV buyers through the Tesla website.\\n“Tesla appreciated the credit unions’ value proposition of offering affordable auto loans, but needed a partner that could provide buyers with a uniform lending experience nationally,” noted Origence Chief Financial Officer Neetu Bhagat.\\n“They liked how FI Connect could provide a single experience for buyers to take advantage of credit unions’ historically low-rate financing options. This partnership supports Tesla’s goal of removing the friction in buying a car, as FI Connect can make loans on a one-to-many basis on behalf of their buyers,” Bhagat continued. “Our credit union clients can tap into a fast-growing market, providing their financing options at the point of sale.”\\nEarly Adopter: Silver State Schools Credit Union\\nTo date, FI Connect has 25 credit unions in its network, a number that is steadily growing. In mid-January 2024, for example, Bhagat noted that 88 credit unions inquired to learn more about the partnership.\\n“We’re currently supporting five states through our credit union partnerships and plan to add several more this quarter,” added Boutelle. “Our goal is to have credit unions live in each of the 31 states that Tesla can do indirect auto loans. We’re actively meeting with credit unions on the value of participating in the Tesla program and the benefits attributed to this new lending channel. Our partner credit unions are promoting this program as well.”\\nAmong early adopters is Silver State Schools Credit Union (SSSCU). The $1.1 billion Las Vegas-based credit union serves more than 63,000 members and supports 10 branches and 202 employees.\\n“SSSCU has always been a major player in the indirect market and being one of the large credit union direct lending (CUDL) indirect lenders in the state of Nevada, we were approached by FI Connect and their parent company Origence,” Senior Vice President Mel Valenzuela told Finopotamus. “The technology and artificial intelligence (AI) developed by Origence was essentially what appealed to me.”\\nAccording to Atlas Public Policy, in September 2023, there were 136,000 EVs sold in the U.S., which represented a 67% year-over-year increase.\\n“The majority of EV financing is done by banks – roughly 56%, followed by captives at 30% and credit union finance around 10 to12%,” Valenzuela said. “Even if 2024 isn’t as strong as years past, being a part of this new lending opportunity will increase market share for credit unions.”\\nValenzuela explained that once the opportunity was offered in summer of 2023, SSSCU quickly signed up and rolled out the service in November 2023. The process was streamlined, he added.\\n“Most of the IT lift came from FI Connect and Origence. The application program interfaces (APIs), the robust automation, and some human interaction, helps reduce overhead costs, thus a better net yield,” he said. “Having Origence as the indirect LOS (loan origination system) helped SSSCU with a quicker implementation and being one of the first credit unions in the nation to go live.”\\nBoutelle added that great efforts were taken to ensure that implementation is as “low-lift” as possible for credit unions.\\n“But we still ask for clients to be engaged and committed throughout the process. If the credit union is currently using our loan origination platform (arc OS), the implementation is much quicker,” he noted. “If the credit union doesn’t have an existing relationship with us, implementation is typically 60 to 90 days.”\\nAnother attracted feature of the program, Valenzuela offered, is that there are no associated marketing or advertising costs. “The loans are spoon-fed to us and we developed robust automation, with the help of FI Connect and Origence.”\\nKnow Your True Net Yields\\nFI Connect currently has $3.6 billion in signed commitments from participating credit unions; a figure Boutelle said will increase throughout 2024.\\nValenzuela explained that SSSCU implemented AI to optimize the automation, which includes: no-picture identification, robust underwriting decisioning and instant funding.\\n“This reduces the overall overhead and allows for a strong net yield product,” he said. “Since inception, mid-November 2023, SSSCU has funded $17 million for 410 loans, and onboarded more than 400 new members.”\\nBesides the “risk diversification from traditional auto loans,” he added that SSSCU is also reviewing traditional loan processes to determine how implementing AI can “enhance the member experience and increase efficiency,” so that the credit union can become more competitive in the marketplace.\\n“As an experienced indirect lender, I know the indirect penetration is low. However, I have personally seen how the impact of a personalized marketing strategy at a previous credit union achieved 28% penetration amongst new indirect members,” Valenzuela said. “SSSCU will implement a similar strategy to connect with these new members and engage them to enhance products per member.”\\nWhen Finopotamus asked what advice Valenzuela has for other credit unions interested in the partnership, he responded: “Know your true net yields, which includes your ‘cost/per loan” and how often an employee touches a loan in the process, and servicing costs (collections EV performance) and compare to traditional indirect.” He added: “Embrace technology/AI and be open to new ways of doing loans.”\\nKeeping Credit Unions Competitive\\nWhile Bhagat told Finopotamus that in order to participate, FI Connect is asking credit unions for a minimum $5 to10 million monthly commitments, the company is in the process of \"creating a path\" for credit unions with less capacity to participate. “We encourage all interested credit unions to reach out for more information,” she noted.\\nFor those attending the 2024 America’s Credit Unions (formerly CUNA) Governmental Affairs Conference (GAC), Boutelle said to stop by the Origence booth to learn more about the opportunity.\\n“FI Connect is the only platform in the market that allows credit unions to connect with large retailers like Tesla directly,” he said. “We’re keeping credit unions competitive and helping them prepare for the future, which is offering embedded financing options at the point-of-sale.”',\n",

       " 'Flying past rumbling train tracks, over gliding freeways and underneath an overcast New York City sky, Marvin Gaye’s ‘What’s Going On’ sets the tone for A Most Violent Year‘s opening moments perfectly. Gaye was a man who worked hard all his life, only to be beaten by the overbearing odds of the times he found himself in – much like Abel Morales, played by Oscar Isaac, the film’s tortured protagonist and a man of fierce principles. It’s a tenuous comparison, but one that makes more sense as J.C. Chandor’s grim tale of a defiant businessman making his reluctant segue into the world of gangsterism (yes, that is a real word) slowly takes its toll on Abel.\\nIt’s 1981, the most crime-filled year in New York on record, and Morales stands as a man who has essentially raised himself. Having built his prospering oil company from the ground up, he takes immense pride in his work, and practically lives for the promise of forging a legacy for his family and wife Anna, played by a fiery Jessica Chastain. But this is all challenged by a mysterious plot to steal his oil trucks from the road, which also invites suspicion from the authorities. It’s as if Michael Corleone remained on the straight and narrow; although those comparisons may be a little easy to make, they are openly invited by Chandor’s constant yet calm debunking of the gangster mythos. Morales has an empire, yet gets scared when he sees a gun; his wife tells him to hide business folders when the police search his home, but he doesn’t know why. That’s what makes him such an arresting character to watch – he is constantly at odds with becoming something he doesn’t want to be, but it’s a transformation which feels inevitable. And Oscar Isaac, on a winning streak with Inside Llewyn Davis and Ex Machina – not to mention a little movie called Star Wars later this year – shows he is one of the world’s most gifted fresh actors, able to convey the intense, heavy moods of Chandor’s reluctant crime epic with a single glance of his eyes: oozing the gravitas of a much more experienced actor at every moment.\\nA somewhat unexpected follow-up to the Robert Redford powerhouse All Is Lost, J.C. Chandor has crafted an engaging thriller that rarely uses any of the tropes of the genre, being more of a slow-boiling character study than a fizzling mystery story – but perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is its beautiful construction of early-’80s New York, a hazy network of breeze block buildings and grey-green skies. This triumphant achievement of tone lends the film’s more unconvincing moments an air of believability – for instance, when Chastain’s Anna changes tact at the drop of a hat. But what has been achieved here, thanks to some fantastic world-building and a perfect anchor in the form of Isaac, is the ultimate anti-gangster movie, which at one point literally quotes Goodfellas in reverse with a throwaway line that we won’t spoil here. Despite the occasional trip-up, A Most Violent Year is exquisite filmmaking from a director who feels like he’s just getting started.',\n",

We're going to making this lime-ade and lemonade ourselves.\\nThese limes are really juicy!\\nAlli helped squeeze the limes too.\\nTime to make the Mint Simple Syrup. And guess who happens to have Mint growing in the front yard!\\nIan and Alli will regularly grab a mint leaf and chew on it when they're playing in the front yard. For today's recipe, we're going to need a small bowl full of mint leaves.\\nAfter washing the leaves off, I added them to a sauce pan with half a cup of sugar and half a cup of water. I mashed up the leaves as best as I could to release the oils and brought the whole thing to a boil. Now it just needs to simmer for 10 minutes.\\nAlli and Ian both like helping in the kitchen. They're good helpers. I see you back there Alli, waiting your turn to stir.\\nAfter straining it a couple times, we've got this tasty mint syrup.\\nNow it's time to get beignets ready. I'm using Paula Deen's beignet recipe for the batter.\\nAfter mixing and then letting the dough rise and rest for 2 hours, it's time to fry them up! And if we're going to imitate Disneyland they've got to be Mickey shaped! I've got a couple size cutters, so we're going to make both. First I used the sandwich bread sized cutter. Those turned out pretty good.\\nBut these mini Mickey heads are adorable.\\nSo cute with all those Mickey's floating in that hot oil.\\nBam! Hit them with a little powdered sugar!\\nYou got the right idea Alli! Time to combine the Lime-ade, Lemonade, and Mint Syrup all together.\\nAdd a sprig of fresh mint and it's a beauty!\\nTime to eat them!\\nThis little boy is wasting no time.\\nAlli wanted honey for hers. And then after she got the honey, she wanted powdered sugar too. After dipping the beignet into honey, the powdered sugar sticks much better.\\nAnd I wasn't the only one who thought so. Chi was so amazed at the flavor of the Mint Julep. She's loving all these new creations that Theresa and I are coming up with now.\\nWow. He ate all those and even wanted more... No more right now buddy, I think we've ruined your dinner already.\\nI'm glad we were able to bring just a little bit of Disneyland home.

Those sisters were Sr. Cecilia Daroit, Sr. Clotilde Appiano and Sr. Margareth Greppi. The house at Mawlai was officially opened on March 14th, 1938 by Mother Clotide M. Coglialo on her annual visit to Assam. The Convent was placed under the patronage of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Sr. Cecelia Daroit was appointed the first Superior of the newly formed Community. At its initial stage, the sisters were entrusted with the task of teaching the newly found primary school and catering to the needs of the orphan girls who lived in the locality running a vocational centre in tailoring, knitting, weaving, dyeing and yarning and a dispensary for the locals.\\nThe 2nd of July 1939, marked a red letter day in the annals of the history of the Salesian Sisters of Northern India where the sisters entered the New House at Mawlai with a spirit of self sacrifice, apostolic missionary zeal and earnestness, the Sisters continued their activities towards the upliftment of the poor and illiterate who were living in this remote part of our country, India.\\nIn 1941, with a view to facilitate educational progress, the Middle School started with Class V and proceeded upto Class VI. In 1956, Class VII was opened which proceeded to the establishment of a complete High School. In 1982, two adjacent plots of land were acquired to accommodate the increasing number of students. The year 1986 saw the establishment of a new building. In 1999, the High School was upgraded to Higher Secondary by the inclusion of Classes XI and XII. This year 2012, the Commerce Stream has been introduced with a view to impart commerce education. This is the first of its kind in Mawlai. At present, the school’s continuous growth and academic excellence has been commented by the Government. The school has been brought under the Deficit Scheme up to the Secondary Section since 1982, thereby enabling it to receive grants and financial aid from the Government.\\nIn addition to our regular activities in school, in the boarding and Pre-aspirantate, the Sisters on sundays and holidays involve themselves in instructing and catechizing programmes in the vicinity, keeping the slogan “We Care and Share” in mind.',\n",

       " 'Matt Richards, a built environment expert and partner at Ridge and Partners, draws on new research to discuss the obstacles facilities managers face when trying to make their organisation’s building Net Zero\\nA crucial piece of the puzzle in the Government’s ambitious goal of Net Zero by 2050 lies in retrofitting the UK’s non-domestic building stock. However, our research report, ‘The Role of Retrofitting our Non-Domestic Buildings in the Race to Net Zero’, reveals that many organisations are falling short in making their premises environmentally sustainable.\\nThe fault for this doesn’t lie with facilities managers and property heads, who despite having a huge workload and many competing pressures to deal with, want to do more to play their part in their organisation’s move to Net Zero. Instead, the problem is the obstacles in their path.\\nTHE OBSTACLES FACILITIES MANAGERS FACE\\nThe 101 facilities and property heads we questioned in our study are facing several challenges to get retrofit projects for their organisations off the ground. These include:\\n- Lack of Board Acknowledgment: A significant roadblock we identified is the lack of recognition from boards regarding the importance of retrofitting in their Net Zero strategy. Despite the majority (76 per cent) of organisations working towards Net Zero, over half (55 per cent) of the facilities and property managers we interviewed for the report said that their boards do not acknowledge the need for retrofitting at all.\\n- Building Heads’ Involvement: This perhaps explains why many organisations are not involving building heads in Net Zero planning. Nearly 23 per cent of those we spoke to have had no involvement at all, and most have not seen their company’s five-year sustainability plans.\\n- Underestimation of Carbon Pollution: We found that organisations are often underestimating the carbon pollution produced by their buildings which is leading to a lack of urgency to reduce it. There’s also confusion; the vast majority (86 per cent) of organisations do not understand how retrofitting can enhance a building’s energy efficiency.\\n- Misconceptions about Building Stock: Many decision-makers harbour misconceptions about the life span of the UK’s existing non-domestic building stock, assuming that the majority will be replaced by 2050. In reality, approximately 70 per cent of today’s buildings will still be in use. This misunderstanding dampens the enthusiasm for retrofitting because it isn’t deemed necessary.\\nOVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES\\nTo help facilities managers address these obstacles we’ve identified five things which we believe need to happen:\\n- Education: Retrofitting needs to be put on agendas and seen as a viable and often preferable alternative to building new. For instance, 24 per cent underestimate the impact of retrofitting, and 45 per cent mistakenly believe carbon-neutral grid energy will negate the need for energy efficiency measures. Also, many organisations ignore the carbon which has been used to create a new building – this must be factored in when weighing up the options.\\n- Involvement: Boards must recognise and harness the expertise of facilities and property heads. Facilities leaders are already involved in other strategic decisions such as the role of buildings on their employer brand or in improving staff wellbeing, performance, and retention. The sustainability agenda is surely another area where property heads can play a major part. Their expertise needs to be respected and deployed.\\n- Budgeting: Retrofit programmes require substantial investment. They cannot be accommodated within day-to-day budgets. Yet over half (54 per cent) of boards base their building budgets on the previous year, which doesn’t consider inflation or energy price fluctuations, let alone a large retrofit project. A new, more strategic approach to building budgets is needed.\\n- Expert Support: Even with their expertise, facilities heads need external support to navigate the complexities of achieving Net Zero and evaluating the benefits of retrofitting vs a new build. Expert guidance is crucial for making informed decisions, prioritising projects, choosing technologies, and building strong business cases.\\n- Incentives: The Government needs to help too. Incentives for energy-efficient buildings are currently lacking. Addressing issues such as VAT treatment for retrofit programs can level the playing field with new builds and encourage more retrofit initiatives.\\nPRACTICALITIES OF RETROFITTING\\nOvercoming these obstacles is crucial, but we recognise that implementing retrofit strategies can also pose challenges. For instance, almost a third (31 per cent) of facilities heads surveyed feel delivering retrofit projects without causing disruption is a tough challenge.\\nHowever, the long-term benefits of retrofit projects, including achieving Net Zero goals, enhancing building efficiency, ensuring employee health and wellbeing, improving productivity, and attracting and retaining staff, outweigh short-term disruptions. Proper planning with multidisciplinary consultant teams can minimise disruption, allowing organisations to continue operations during retrofit projects.\\nWhile many organisations are making strides in reducing their carbon footprint, the role of buildings in this endeavour remains underestimated. To make substantial progress, a collaborative approach is needed to address the five key areas hindering retrofitting efforts. Once these are tackled, with the right practical support and expertise, facilities management professionals can truly play a pivotal role in delivering the UK’s Net Zero ambitions.\\nThe full report can be accessed at: https://ridge.co.uk/insights/the-uks-retrofit-crisis/',\n",

You can use white meat or dark meat, or a combo. You can use some from our Whole Roasted Chicken, or simply poach boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs in water seasoned with salt, a few peppercorns and a bay leaf.\\nIf you have time, throw in a few pieces of chopped carrot and celery for flavor, if you have them around.\\nCostco as well as Whole Foods have plain rotisserie chicken available that is low FODMAP. Perhaps your local supermarket does too? Ask!\\nLow FODMAP Asian Chicken Salad\\nThink chicken salad is boring?

Scrape down blender as needed. Taste and add more hot sauce if desired. If you use natural peanut butter and the mixture is a bit thick, blend in a tablespoon or two of water. You want a flowable texture. The dressing can be made a day ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container.\\nFor Chicken Salad Assembly: In a large mixing bowl, toss together the chicken, cabbage, carrot, bell pepper, cucumbers of the cilantro, half the peanuts and half of the scallions (you can do this by eye). Add some of the dressing and toss to coat. Only add enough dressing to lightly coat the salad ingredients. You might not need all of the sauce. Serve garnished with remaining cilantro, peanuts and scallions. Salad may be serve with the chicken slightly warm, or everything at room temperature.\\nSalad may be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before serving. It is best if you can garnish with the scallions, peanuts and cilantro right before serving. Or even better, if you know you want to make way ahead, keep salad and dressing separate until close to serving time (and those garnishes, too!)\\n- Like so many dishes that need cooked chicken, you could make things super simple and buy a rotisserie chicken. Many are low FODMAP (even the ones at Costco). Just always buy the “plain” style and read labels. You might even be able to find a low FODMAP rotisserie chicken at your local supermarket.\\nAll nutritional information is based on third-party calculations and should be considered estimates.

       " 'Planning for retirement is not something most young people think about, especially when they in the early part of their careers.\\nHowever, statistics show that starting to set a bit of cash aside on a regular basis from the moment you begin working can have a significant impact on the amount of funds available when the time comes to retire.\\nThe main reason is the ability to harness the power of compounding, especially when the money is invested in dividend-paying stocks. Over time, the reinvestment of the distributions in new shares can turn relatively small contributions into significant sums of money, but you have to start early.\\nMost investors view Suncor as an oil sands company. That’s certainly the largest part of its business, but Suncor also has positions in offshore oil production and growth opportunities worldwide. In Eastern Canada, the recently completed Hebron facility is ramping up production ahead of schedule. Suncor also has positions in other major Atlantic plays, including Hibernia, White Rose, and Terra Nova. In Europe, Suncor is a partner in key exploration and production opportunities in the U.K. and Norway.\\nAside from the upstream assets, Suncor has refining and marketing operations. The four large refineries produce end products including gasoline, diesel fuel, asphalt and jet fuel. The company’s 1,500 Petro-Canada retail locations sell fuel.\\nIn addition, Suncor has four wind power projects with capacity of more than 100 MW. The company also operates Canada’s largest biofuels plant.\\nA recovery in the energy sector is providing a nice boost to margins, and Suncor continues to share the profits with investors. The company raised the dividend by 12.5% for 2018, and the steady gains should continue in the coming years. At the time of writing, the stock provides a yield of 2.7%.\\nLong-term investors have done well with Suncor. A $10,000 investment in the company 20 years ago would be worth more than $120,000 today with the dividends reinvested.\\nRenewable power and electric cars certainly pose a threat to the oil industry, and while the combustion engine should eventually be phased out, predictions about the impending death of the oil sector are likely overblown.\\nShould you buy Suncor stock?\\nThe company has a strong balance sheet and a resource base that should drive production growth for decades. Suncor’s diversified business lines provide a nice hedge against downturns in the oil market and the company manages to capture global pricing on a significant part of its production, despite pipeline bottlenecks in western Canada.\\nAt some point, the pipeline issue should get resolved, and that would enable Suncor to boost output and sell to additional overseas markets.\\nIf you are a long-term oil bull, Suncor is an attractive buy-and-hold pick for a dividend-focused retirement portfolio.',\n",

We have several packages built to fit your budget and get you exactly what you need to start sniping on the airsoft battlefield. Our Sniper Starter Kits come in two levels, a BASIC or COMPLETE kit. The basic kit gets you the barebones setup to shoot your sniper rifle and have a magnified optic on it.

The Ares Amoeba Striker AS-01 is the new benchmark in affordable high quality sniper rifles. Though this rifle is affordable, don\\'t let the sub-$200 price fool you. Though deceptively inexpensive, when you first pick up this rifle you will immediately notice that it feels like a premium grade real steel rifle. The polymer stock has a nice texture and rigid feel to it that you would expect out of a real rifle that has a synthetic stock. Internally and externally this rifle was designed with modularity in mind. The stock can be adapted in numerous ways with different grip sections, recoil pads, and cheek pieces to fit the user.\\nThe main selling point is its practicality. The internals utilize commonly found upgrade parts that are used to typically upgrade a VSR-10 style sniper rifle. Normally most sniper rifles are proprietary or use items that are still harder to locate though they are available. This makes sniper rifles a type of gun in airsoft that becomes very specialized if you want to use it any other way than stock out of the box. This is sometimes a bad solution for the newer players who are buying a new rifle and trying to be conscious of future desires in accuracy and performance and choose to buy right by buying once. This gun still shoots nicely whether you are trying to future proof or not.\\nSo what else makes it practical? The cylinder is specially designed to use AEG springs. This gives you numerous velocity options that typically are not available in sniper rifles. As a byproduct of this, cocking the Striker is much easier due to the shorter pull than traditional airsoft snipers. This makes it ideal for faster shooting on a bolt action rifle.\\nNo sights are included so you will have to purchase a scope right off thee bat when you get this rifle. This rifle features a picatinny rail so you can scope the rifle with just about anything you can find. The magazine is 45 rounds and is a detachable magazine that can be quickly changed for fast reloads. Since the magazine is larger than normal, this makes it easier to grab compared to other sniper rifle magazines which are tiny and sit flush in the gun.\\nThis airsoft sniper rifle is offered in 4 colors, black, desert tan, olive drab and urban grey.\\nFOX AIRSOFT OFFERS A 30 DAY WARRANTY AND REFUND POLICY WHICH YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT HERE. THE MANUFACTURER ALSO OFFERS A 90 DAY WARRANTY FOR THIS PRODUCT.\\nAlternate Lookup: 2274590 2274589 2274587',\n",

       " 'Have you ever had a ‘gut feeling’ or been told to ‘go with your gut’? You might have thought this is just an expression but research suggests that there is a connection between the gut and the brain: the gut can send signals to the brain, just as well as the brain can communicate with the gut. In this article we will explore how the health of your gut can influence your mental wellbeing and the steps you can take to improve your gut health.\\nHow is gut health related to mental health\\nYour gut and brain are connected physically through a nerve called the vagus nerve. This connection is known as the gut brain axis. Similarly, your gut and brain are also connected through chemicals known as neurotransmitters. These chemicals are produced in the brain and control emotions such as happiness, tiredness, anxiety and fear. When the gut is in poor health, these neurotransmitters interfere with the body’s production of serotonin (the chemical which makes us feel happy) along with dopamine and norepinephrine, resulting in potential low mood or anxiety.\\nGut microbiome imbalance\\nThousands of different types of bacteria (referred to as your microbiome) live within your gastrointestinal tract. These are made up of both good and bad bacteria, with the balance in favour of good gut bacteria. Studies suggest that mental health problems such as depression and anxiety may be associated with a change in balance within the microbiome in the gut, causing health issues not just in the body, but also within the brain.\\nMental health and pre-existing gastro health conditions\\nWhen you feel anxious, worried or stressed, you may experience pain or discomfort in your gut. There is evidence to suggest that anxiety aggravates symptoms of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or contributes to flare ups in Crohn’s Disease and Colitis. Moreover, the emotional stress caused by these conditions can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and this can become a vicious circle.\\nIn a large-scale study exploring the gut-brain connection carried out by the University of Southampton and King’s College London, it was shown that mental health therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can provide relief for symptoms associated with IBS. This signifies that there are connections between the brain and the gut and looking after your mental health could improve your gut health.\\nHow to improve gut health\\nA healthy and balanced diet is one of the most important things we can do for our gut health. You can achieve this by including a variety of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes, nuts and seeds in your diet.\\nConsuming foods which contain prebiotics can feed the good bacteria in your gut and help them to grow. Bananas, asparagus, onions and garlic are a great natural source of prebiotic. Similarly, prebiotics can also be added to processed foods to increase their nutritional value.\\nThere is still a long way to go before we fully understand the relationship between gut health and mental health. While there is no conclusive or definite evidence, it is generally accepted that a strong relationship exists between gut and mental health. As research continues, we may eventually see the development of treatments such as nutritional psychiatry in the future.\\nDisclaimer: The content of this website is provided for informational purposes only and does not substitute the medical advice from a healthcare professional.',\n",
       " 'by Erin Pender | November 22, 2022\\nOur Teacher Feature series highlights how special education teachers and professionals have each implemented FrenalyticsEDU into their classrooms. This edition features Jennifer Gemski, ATP (Assistive Technology Professional) at the Campus School at Boston College.\\nJen Gemski began working at the Campus School at Boston College in the fall of 2020 as an Assistive Technology Professional (ATP), introducing a variety of technology into classrooms. The Campus School serves students with extensive support and medical needs between the ages of three and twenty-two, and has six classrooms with three to six students per class.\\nJoining the Campus School in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jen experienced the challenges of providing remote therapies to students. Those challenges included tracking progress and maintaining communication among team members. Gemski said, “It’s always better to be in person.” Jen discovered FrenalyticsEDU and realized it could help address these challenges:\\nAs far as Frenalytics, I see the benefit as allowing therapists to share information amongst the students’ entire team, including therapists, family members, and educators. Capturing progress data and comprehension questions for our students, especially those who are non-verbal, is especially powerful.”\\nGemski sees Frenalytics as an effective way to capture data, especially with the students in which the Campus School serves. Jen is currently trialing classroom integration with FrenalyticsEDU, our personalized learning software designed with teachers, for teachers in special education environments.\\nSince many of her students are nonverbal, it is important to be able to collect accurate data about student comprehension as well as information about their personal preferences. Additionally, since all of the students have Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), it is essential to look at what is working, and to easily track each student’s progress.\\nGemski also emphasized that Frenalytics is unique because of how it can be customized:\\nI also think Frenalytics is unique because because at the Campus School, we use a customized, multi-sensory approach. Most of the other cognitive applications or software applications in this space don’t have that flexibility.”\\nThe Campus School uses other innovative technology programs, including Camera Mouse, a mouse replacement program for computers developed at Boston College. Gemski was elated to discover that Frenalytics is compatible with this technology.\\nWith FrenalyticsEDU, the comprehension and assessment questions that are part of teachers’ lessons can be entered directly into the software, allowing students to review what they have learned. Additionally, the data collected by Frenalytics allows teachers and other special education professionals to track students’ progress:\\nI’m excited to capture meaningful data throughout our student’s school day.”\\nIf a student clicks the right answer, was it an involuntary movement, or intentional? Consistency and repetition is key; by using Frenalytics to repeat questions, Gemski and other staff members can review the data collected and identify patterns indicating a student’s progress:\\nWe can make comparisons… Everybody keeps their own notes and their own data… with Frenalytics we share data and have the ability to share responses and to view everyone’s data at once.”\\nAdditionally, Gemski explained that being able to display pictures and sounds into Frenalytics alongside answer options is so important for the students whom she serves:\\nOur students benefit from a multi-sensory approach… sight, sound, touch, smell, feelings, presence.”\\nThis multi-sensory approach can also help educators and other professionals to customize students’ therapy sessions or classroom sessions. For example, Gemski said that if a student shows a clear and repeated preference for Taylor Swift, different professionals throughout the day can offer her songs to that student as a leisure choice.\\nGemski’s experiences with Frenalytics and her vision for how it can be useful across classrooms at the Campus School demonstrate the ways in which FrenalyticsEDU can be a useful tool for students, teachers, and other educational professionals across the country – and around the world.\\nHere at Frenalytics, our goal is to provide meaningful educational opportunities to students of all abilities, all while making learning fun & engaging.',\n",
       " 'Most people know that jeans with flared bottoms like bootcut jeans or cowboy cut jeans are great choices for cowboy boots.\\nThe reason is simple, they have enough room in the bottom legs for you to insert the boot shaft. And this is also a very popular style of most die-hard fans in the cowboy boots world.\\nSo besides bootcut jeans, are there any other jeans suitable to wear with cowboy boots?\\nToday’s post is the answer for you! You just need to grasp some basic principles, it’s very simple!\\nLet’s check it out!\\nIs it ok to wear normal jeans with cowboy boots?\\nUsually, the most basic and preferred style of men when wearing cowboy boots is tucking the boot shaft into jeans. For this reason, the bottom legs of the jeans must be wide enough.\\nIn fact, you don’t necessarily consider bootcut jeans the only option for this style, any type of jeans is fine, as long as the bottom legs have enough room to fit the boot shaft in and bring you a “smooth” look. The “smoothness” here means the V shape of the boot collar should not be imprinted on the surface of the jeans.\\nJust knowing that basic, regular jeans or straight-leg jeans are both very good choices for men’s cowboy boots. They still give you the clean look you’ve always desired.\\nToday, Wrangler, a major brand in jeans and other accessories, has released cowboy-cut jeans that are a great match to wear with cowboy boots. They have bottom legs that are not as wide as bootcut jeans but are still enough to tuck the boot shaft in and give you a more youthful style.\\nAlso, some famous cowboy boot brands like Tecovas offer casual jeans that are great to wear with cowboy boots.\\nStandard Jeans from Tecovas are not bootcut jeans, but they fit both your body shape and the boot shaft well.\\nSome of my friends even wear slim jeans with cowboy boots. The way they make the boot shaft not print on the jeans is to use laces to tighten the boot shaft. Interesting, isn’t it? You can also do this with tapered jeans!\\nBut for the same reason mentioned above, jeans like skinny or short jeans are not a good choice.\\nSkinny jeans are often too narrow to fit over boots, whereas wearing cowboy boots over jeans can be impractical. Conversely, short jeans reveal the boot shaft, which is another style men usually don’t prefer. These two types of jeans are generally the least favored by men when wearing boots.\\nThe world of men’s cowboy boots doesn’t like revealing boot shafts if your job doesn’t really force you to do so. They cause a contrast in style and do not offer a clean look or classic beauty as one would expect.\\nMeanwhile, it’s a different story for women, they can wear… everything with cowboy boots. So in addition to bootcut jeans, other types such as regular jeans, straight-leg jeans, skinny jeans, low-rise rise or high-rise jeans are all great choices! As long as you coordinate your cowboy boots, jeans, and outfits in the right way.\\nFor women, you don’t really need to care about what kind of jeans can go with cowboy boots, but pay attention to the harmony and match between outfits and boots. There are no strict rules for women like that for men in the cowboy boots world.\\nIn general, do not be too rigid in style, you can completely use ordinary jeans like straight-leg jeans to wear with cowboy boots.\\nNowadays, you will see men even wearing dress pants or suits with cowboy boots and that combination is absolutely amazing.\\nJust for men, you need to stay away from exposing the boot shaft like tucking pants into boots or wearing shorts. Don’t make yourself silly. Also, make sure your jeans have enough room at the bottom for the boot shaft to fit in.\\nFor women, wear whatever you want with cowboy boots! As long as they are harmonious, eye-catching, and fit your purpose, that’s it!\\nHowdy y’all, and welcome to From The Guest Room, your ultimate guide to all things Western! I’m Jay Gatz, a lifelong cowboy boot enthusiast with over 5 years of experience in the Western style world.

In a matter of days a relatively small and obscure sect have been singled out as electoral terrorists. (And they probably can't even spell 'Osama'.) These Brethren may be exclusive, but the media exposure has been anything but. Media outlets of all shapes are clambering over eachother for the definitive headline exposé. Are these people guilty of closed meetings ? Secret lives? Not voting? Tyrannical power? Getting rich? Lobbying politicians? Deceptive campaigning? Fracturing families? Destroying lives? Most likely. But it's been happening in our neighbourhoods for decades at least. Almost no one noticed, much less cared.\\nMy political sympathies are left of centre. But this latent moral outrage smacks of insincerity. The real issue is electoral paranoia by some on the left. The Brethren's logic that political lobbying is fine whilst voting isn't, is odd certainly. But some of our best eccentrics are already in power! If these people want to pour money into an electoral process in which they will never participate, whose problem is that?\\nMore worrying is the potential spin-off of harassment of ordinary Exclusive Brethren folk, especially distinctively-dressed women.

       " 'Titan Bet is one of the most popular bookies in the world, and virtually anyone who has ever placed a bet online will recognise the name; they’re reliable, trusted, and offer a fantastic range of online gambling products. If you’re not yet registered with them you would do well to check them out, and we’ll tell you why in the following post.\\nAlthough we are focussing on the sports betting facilities today, Titan Bet offer a lot more than just this; they also run an online casino, online poker gaming, and instant win games. One account is sufficient to give you access to all of the various areas of the site, meaning you avoid the hassle of having to remember the details for multiple accounts.\\nPOPULAR OFFERS & FEATURES\\nTitan Bet run a couple of offers for you to take advantage of, and below we’ll cover the details of each of them and look at some of the main perks you can enjoy as a Titan Bet member.\\nTITAN BET ACCA CLUB\\nTitan Bet offer a very generous loyalty program which enables you to enjoy up to three great offers, all for simply placing a football bet on the site.\\nThe three offers that make up the Titan Bet Club are shown below:\\nOffer #1: Weekly £5 Acca – Simply place and settle a minimum of 5 X £5 bets on the football (all with 4+ selections) during the week, and you’ll enjoy a £5 free bet on Sunday to use on the football match of your choice. Free bets are credited to players’ accounts every Monday at midday on the dot, and there are very few limits as to what your free bet can be used on.\\nOffer #2: Free Bet If 1 Lets You Down – If you place a 6 fold or higher accumulator on any of the qualifying markets/events and one selection loses, you’ll enjoy a free bet worth up to £25 to use on any football bets. Better yet, the free bet is issued just one hour after the initial bet is settled, meaning there’s no waiting around for this one.\\nOffer #3: Cash Bonus on Winnings – Place an accumulator with 6 or more selections, and if the acca wins you’ll enjoy between 25% and 50% bonus winnings up to a maximum of a whopping £5,000. The bonus is credited to your account right away so you’ll see it almost instantly.\\nAs you can see, Titan bet take their players’ satisfaction seriously, and the Bet Acca Club allows you to enjoy far more regular perks than most sites give you, on a range of football markets.\\nWhile it’s probably a little annoying if you aren’t a big football fan, it’s still well-worth taking part in as the value is there.\\nMONTHLY FREE BETS\\nAs we’ve seen from a large number of bookies, monthly free bets are now becoming the norm as a way of rewarding punters, and Titan Bet are no different; in fact, they offer you the chance to earn up to £200 in free bets each and every month.\\nHere’s how it works:\\nFor every 20 x £10 bets you place (on Horse Racing or in-play sports such as Football, American Football, Basketball, Baseball, Tennis, Darts, Snooker, and Ice Hockey) you’ll be rewarded with a free £10 bet, and as you can claim this promotion up to 20 times a month there is potentially as much as £200 up for grabs.\\nAs soon as you’ve hit the requirements you’ll see the bonus bet automatically added to your balance, and it’s then up to you as to which sport to use it on.\\nTHE TITANBET WEBSITE\\nTitan Bet offer one of the most well-built and unique websites around, and everything from the way in which you sign up and join the site to depositing and withdrawing is fully optimised to ensure your satisfaction. As you’ll see from some of the features and facilities we’re going to cover below, Titan Bet certainly know how to build a decent sports book.\\nBefore we get into the sports book specifics, it’s worth noting that Titan Bet offer a huge range of other products, including an online casino, online poker facilities, and a few other areas too such as bingo, Live Dealer games, and a Macau section.\\nIf you’re going to be sticking to sports betting then these probably won’t have much of an impact on your activities, but they’re worth pointing out, as many players do like to mix things up sometimes and dabble in other areas of the site.\\nInside the online casino you’ll find a huge range of games – primarily from NetEntertainment – with some of the more popular titles being: Go Bananas, The Wish Master, Zombies, Reel Rush, Dazzle Me, Secrets of Atlantis, Muse, Fairytale Legends: Little Red Riding Hood, Wild Turkey, South Park: Reel Chaos, Steamtower, Elements the Awakening, Flowers: Christmas Edition, Alien Robots, Tornado: Farm Escape, Drive: Multiplier Mayhem, Robin Hood Shifting Reels, and many more.\\nIf you prefer Live Dealer Games, then click ‘Live Casino’ from the top navigation menu and you’ll be able to play Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, and other casino table games, against a live dealer streamed directly to your screen in real time.\\nOn the Titan Bet homepage you’ll see a tab named ‘Highlights’, and here you’ll be able to view all the highlights of the days betting markets. Titan Bet also showcase some of their best current promotions and bonuses here that you’re able to claim right away.\\nThe site claims to use the latest technology to learn more about your betting habits, and this will then be used to display highlights on your feed that are relevant to you. While some players were initially a little concerned about privacy, Titan Bet assures punters that their betting preferences and personal information are safe, and will never be shared with anyone else.\\nSports Betting at Titanbet\\nTitanbet tend not to focus on a specific market, and instead they offer their punters a massive variety of markets to enjoy, from British classics like Horse Racing, Greyhounds, and Cricket; to international offerings, like American Football, MBA, NHL, and Aussie Rules Football.\\nAll of the markets available can be accessed using the main navigation menu on the left-hand side of the page, and this allows you to view popular markets plus an ‘A-Z’ market list which provides a full breakdown of all available markets.\\nIn all honesty, it’s pretty rare not to find the market that you want at Titanbet; and while it’s not quite up to the same levels as the biggest bookies, unless you’re looking for extremely niche events you should be all good.\\nFootball is worth highlighting, as Titanbet offer a large selection of bet coupons and pre-made coupons (such as both teams to score in both halves) which means you can drastically cut down on the amount of time spent browsing events and adding individual selections to your bet slip.\\nThe unusual sports markets available include Water Polo, Volleyball, GAA, and Wrestling; the latter of which is very rare indeed due to fears of insider betting, with the sport being admittedly fixed.\\nOne thing that becomes clear quickly on the Titanbet website, is that they are really getting stuck in as far as betting offers are concerned, and they have marketed themselves well as a prime platform for football bets. Other sports markets have not been left by the wayside however, and it is possible to place over 8,000 bet variations for more than 20 different sports types during high season. All in all, Titanbet is able to fulfil all of the important review criteria for bet offers, making them a genuine competitor for the top dogs in sports betting.\\nThe Football markets cover nations at least to the third leagues, and another focus, even within live bets, is on Tennis.\\nTitanbet also get additional points for its U.S. sports (American Football, Baseball & Basketball), but only in terms of quantity as there are no interesting special bets to be found here.\\nHow Good are the Odds?\\nA simple search of various comparison sites shows Titanbet ranking merely average when it comes to prices, and if you frequent online forums you may well have seen the bookie criticised for their stingy odds, especially on Football markets.\\nIt seems Titanbet have embraced this feedback, however, restructuring their business in order to offer more generous and dynamic odds; but still, they struggling to compete with the major players in the industry whose prices and deals can’t often be beaten.\\nIn an attempt to compete, Titanbet have recently added a ‘Best Price Guaranteed’ section of the site, which guarantees you the best price for your selection. For example, if you place a bet on a horse with odds of 8/1, and the horse starts the race at 10/1, you’d get odds of 10/1 on your bet if it won.\\nIn Play Betting\\nSince first opening the in-play betting centre Titanbet have put a lot of effort into developing their live markets, and 6 years since its initial launch, the bookie has gone on to create a platform that’s enjoyed by thousands of players every hour. There are even sound effects relating to real time game info (the ref’s whistle for example).\\nTo begin with, the in-play markets offered were a little threadbare, but they have managed to continually add new markets with recent additions including Volleyball, Golf, and Tennis.\\nTitanbet also boast a number of unique Asian markets. A full explanation of how these differ to some of the markets you may already be familiar with can be found in the ‘Best Features’ section later on in this post.\\nAsian Handicap Betting Odds\\nAs with some of our other reviews, we’re going to focus on just one just area here; the Asian Handicap Betting Odds. While we briefly covered this earlier, we want to talk a bit more about what Asian Handicaps actually are, and why Titanbet are a recommended choice if you’re looking to place odds on any of the Asian markets.\\nAt this point you might well be wondering: What are Asian Handicap betting odds?\\nPut simply, they’re odds developed in Asia that are worked out in a different way, offering punters a higher chance of winning when compared to conventional odds (which could include things like betting outright, each-way, etc).\\nLet’s use a football match as an example: Before the game begins, both teams are given a handicap which can be either positive or negative. They are in decimal format, so a positive handicap could be +0.5, while a negative handicap may look like -1.5 – basically, it’s a handicap of goals.\\nIf you saw a team with a handicap of -2.0, therefore, it would mean they essentially start the match 2-0 down. This would mean that your team would need to score, and be clear, at least three goals before the end of the match. If the team you pick manages to do so, you win.\\nSo what’s so special about the Asian markets at Titanbet? Well, Titanbet offer one of the biggest selection of Asian Handicap markets around for a start and this ensures you have a fine degree of choice when it comes to placing your bets.\\nTitanbet are also renowned for their generosity with the prices on their Asian Handicap bets, meaning you’ll very likely get better odds at Titanbet than you would elsewhere.\\nTitan Bet may appear superior in most areas so far, but unfortunately the banking side of their operation is a little lacking – although it should be noted that punters from the UK will have absolutely no problem. Players from other European countries however may find the range of deposit and withdrawal methods a little limiting.\\nIn this post however, we’re looking at UK bookmakers, so below we will cover the main payment methods available to UK players along with any minimum/maximum deposits and withdrawals, and any fees associated with each method. In fact, we’ve built a quick table to quickly summarise the various payment methods available to you:\\n|Visa and Mastercard Debit cards\\n|1 hour to 1 day\\nThat’s the deposit methods, now let’s take a look at the withdrawal options, alongside the fees and minimum withdrawal amounts associated:\\n|Visa Debit cards\\nNow, you’ll notice that you’re not able to use your MasterCard to withdraw funds from your account. This is nothing to do with Titan Bet, but regulations put in place by the U.K.’s payment processor industry.\\nAs you can see, Titan Bet don’t offer the largest selection of deposit and withdrawal methods in the world, but they do offer PayPal, which is more than can be said for the majority of other bookmakers, and with processing times of under 24 hours it won’t be long before your money is on its way to you using this method.\\nHistory & About\\nTitanbet is one of the largest online gambling sites in the world, and between their Poker, Sportsbook, and Casino products, they enjoy a significant chunk of a very competitive marketplace.\\nThe sports book side of the operation is just as successful as the poker and casino areas, and is also hosted using Playtech software. Playtech is one of the world’s leading casino developers, making both games and white label casino solutions. They are listed on the London Stock Exchange which is a mark of both trust and reliability, and this software is just one of the many reasons why Titanbet has enjoyed so much success.\\nFocusing on quality mobile betting from the offset, Titanbet have ensured their players can enjoy an extremely smooth and customisable betting experience, and their mobile apps and mobile ready website allow players on virtually any device to get in on the action.\\nMarket wise, Titanbet are known for boasting one of the largest selections of markets and events in the world, with over 40,000 different markets found at the bookie each and every month. That’s a pretty impressive figure, rivalling even the likes of Coral and Betfair.\\nIn order to attract players, Titanbet run rigorous ad campaigns with lucrative promotions and bonuses, and in their own words:\\n“To complement the huge range of sports bets on offer at Titanbet, we offer a wide range of sports betting promotions that include generous free bet rewards, cash back specials, unique refunds, and a wonderful free bet welcome package.”\\nPlus, once you’ve opened an account at Titanbet, you’ll also enjoy automatic access to the Titanbet Poker, Casino, games, Live Dealer Games, and Bingo – with your balance shared across all products, eradicating the need for multiple deposits and having to transfer funds between accounts.\\nStrong emphasis on security and responsible gambling are two more of Titanbet’s strong points, and because of the good work they are doing the bookie continues to grow, with new players joining all the time.',\n",

Since then, fans have been begging for Sony to reconsider to little avail.\\nTake a look at the story trailer for Days Gone below.\\nIf you were already disappointed about Days Gone 2 being, uh, gone, this latest update from the original game’s director is going to add some serious salt to the wound.

When asked why he and the team can’t still push for it to happen, he replied: “Too much time has passed, and over 90 people from the original team have left the studio. And Sony just doesn't seem to care for it.”\\nUnderstandably, Days Gone fans are gutted: “Bums me out just reading your post. Especially if they would have stuck to the co-op feature it would have been amazing,” Twitter user @JD52436357 replied. “I was so excited for a sequel after getting the Plat, Days Gone 2 would have been incredible,” added @KalidusX.\\nEven though all seems lost, Ross added that there’s still “a chance” that the sequel could happen one day, even though he claims that the odds of it happening are “one in a million”.\",\n",

In addition, Building Heroes graduates will also be considered for any vacancies in Southern\\'s team.\\nOn Friday, 6 December, the partners celebrated the graduation of the first Southern employee together with 12 ex-servicemen at Southern\\'s new maintenance depot in Horsham.

       " 'Four Surprising Causes Of\\nIf you are experiencing regular neck pain that just won’t\\ngo away, it’s possible that parts of your daily routine are contributing\\nwithout you realising. Here are a few common everyday activities that might be\\nmaking your neck pain worse.\\n1. Your sleeping position\\nIt’s easy to underestimate the impact your sleeping position has however,\\nspending hours in one position will undoubtedly have an effect on your body.\\nPillows that are too high or too flat can mean your cervical joints are sitting\\nat the end of their range in too much flexion or extension. Similarly, sleeping\\non your stomach often means your thoracic spine is locked into extension and\\nyour neck is fully rotated. In simpler terms, this means your joints are under\\nmore stress than necessary. Ideal sleeping posture allows your spine to\\nmaintain it’s natural curves.\\n2. Your daily commute\\nMany of us make sure our work stations are ergonomically set up to reduce\\nstress and strain throughout the day. Few of us take the same consideration\\nwhen it comes to driving. In fact, the set up of your car can be just as\\nimportant as your work-desk, particularly if you are driving more than 30\\nminutes everyday. The correct setup in your car can mean you use less effort to\\ndrive and turn your head less often to check traffic.\\nEnsuring that your steering wheel, seat and mirrors are set up correctly\\ncould make a difference to your posture and even perhaps reduce neck pain and\\nheadaches. If you find that driving is still affecting your pain after making\\nthese changes, try catching public transport or riding a bike on alternative\\n3. Your downtime\\nMany of us\\nunwind by watching TV or our laptops at the end of the day. Your position\\nduring this time can be something you give little thought to however, looking\\nup to view a screen mounted on a wall or looking down at a small screen or\\nlaptop can put pressure on the upper structures of the neck. Take a few minutes\\nto consider what posture you’re sitting in before settling down to binge watch\\na series and see if you can either lower the height of your screen or raise it\\nslightly so your neck can be in a more neutral position.\\n4. Your exercise routine\\nAny activity that requires sustained positions or repetitive neck\\nmovements can contribute to neck pain. Cyclists can be stuck in neck extension\\nwhile looking ahead and breast stroke swimmers can also have excess neck\\nextension. Freestyle swimmers with reduced thoracic or neck rotation can have\\ndifficulty achieving rotation when breathing which can cause pain and\\ndiscomfort over time.\\nIf you need any further information about neck pain then click\\n, or call the clinic on 028 92666959, or email email@example.com\\nYour physiotherapist is able to\\nidentify any daily habits or activities that might be contributing to your neck\\npain.

       " 'Section 4 – FOREIGN – Group 2\\nThe intriguing Sphynx cat never fails to draw a reaction from people and is certainly something of a conversation piece – some people love the bald, wrinkled look, some are fascinated by the cat, while others are less than enthusiastic! The most distinctive feature of the cat is its lack of fur.\\nThe Sphynx is of medium size, boning and body conformation with surprising weight for its size. The head shape is a modified wedge, with prominent cheekbones and whisker pads. The body is warm and soft to the touch, with a chamois leather-like texture to the skin. The Sphynx is sweet-tempered, lively, intelligent and amenable to handling.\\nThe Sphynx cat first appeared in Ontario, Canada in 1966 when a black and white domestic shorthair named Elizabeth gave birth to a litter of kittens which included a hairless male. His name was Prune and, when he was old enough, he was mated back to his mother which resulted in a litter of coated and hairless kittens, some of which were exported to Europe and acquired the breed’s name. In 1988, the first Sphynx to enter the UK from Holland was a four year old female called Tulip. Tulip became a great ambassador for the breed and was put on exhibition at three GCCF shows where she gained much admiration from the public. Tulip lived to be over fifteen years old.\\nDespite appearances, the Sphynx is not a totally naked cat. Their body is covered with a soft down, which is almost imperceptible to both the eye and the touch. The texture of the skin is likened to that of a warm peach or a chamois cloth. Sphynx have some fine hair over the bridge of their nose and on their feet. This can also be found on their tails and the back of the ears – and on the scrotum of the males. Degree of coat depends on several factors e.g. climate, hormones and hereditary predispositions. Their bodies are warmer to the touch than that of other cats but, in fact, their temperature is no higher. Sphynx are very clever and they will pop under a blanket when it is getting cold or find a warm human body or dog or cat to curl up with. Kittens are very wrinkly but as they develop they grow into their skin, maintaining some of the wrinkles, especially on the head. Sphynx are indoor cats as they can easily get burnt by the sun and have little protection should they come across a feisty neighbourhood cat. They can go out under supervision and weather permitting, ideally on a harness, in an enclosed safe garden or a purpose-built run. Males are generally 25% larger then the females and they come in all colours and patterns.\\nThe Sphynx cat is possibly one of the most affectionate, sociable and intelligent cats in the world. They are in your face 24/7 and very much ‘people cats’. They will greet you, snuggle up and sleep with you and you will have no say in the matter whatsoever. Vocal, almost to the point where you find yourselves having a two-way conversation, Sphynx hate being alone. They can learn to play fetch and love to play. They enjoy the company of children and other animals and make a wonderful addition to any family that is prepared to lavish the time and attention they crave. The Sphynx is very outgoing and they are often described by their owners as elf-like or child-like due to their inquisitive and intelligent nature. They crave human company and can often be found following their owners around the house. They live quite happily with other cats and dogs. As they are so gregarious they should never be kept as the only cat in a household – but should have some form of feline company, ideally another Sphynx.\\nAs the Sphynx lacks a coat, body oils cannot be absorbed by the fur but these can be removed by bathing, which most Sphynx seem to enjoy. Attention should be given to their ears and feet as they can get very dirty with wax but are cleaned easily with cotton buds (but do be careful not to go into the ear canal with a bud). Sphynx are not delicate and, contrary to popular belief, do not require extra heat; in fact, this will make them sweat more. An ordinary cat bed with a blanket that they can wrap up in is perfectly acceptable. Female Sphynx cats weight 6 to 8 lbs and male Sphynx cats weigh 8 to 11 lbs. They usually require a slightly higher caloric intake than other breeds because their bodies are constantly working hard to keep them warm. Sphynx cats have a lifespan of 15 years or more.\\nThe Sphynx is not a hypoallergenic cat despite the claims of some people. If you are allergic to the proteins in a cat’s saliva, you will be allergic to the Sphynx as well. Some people who are allergic to cats do tolerate the Sphynx breed better than normal coated cats. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been reported to affect young to middle aged Sphynx cats. The certain disease is usually discovered during a routine annual health check. The vet will hear a faster heart rate and perhaps congestion sounds in the lungs, while the pulse feels weak. Luckily, HCM can be treated with special medical care. However, breeding only from Sphynx that are free from this gene will ensure that they will not develop the form of HCM associated with it.',\n",

Its implementation is based on a regular light probe field that is calculated in an accurate way from scene representation (voxel and/or triangles) and allows real-time multiple bounce lighting from semi-dynamic light sources and semi-dynamic scene. This method simplifies an artist's work, and allows them to create realistic lighting on huge scale locations.The talk will cover technical details of the system and how it can be implemented in any deferred rendering pipeline. A number of solutions to common problems are presented, such as how to handle probe bleeding in indoor areas and handle foliage. The session also discusses performance and memory optimization, and optional benefits from using modern ray tracing GPU capabilities.\",\n",
       " 'A crypto debit card lets you purchase cryptocurrency and pay with your local currency. A cryptocurrency debit card holds your crypto balance as collateral and does not convert it into fiat. This way, you can keep more crypto and pay interest in crypto. TenX is a cryptocurrency debit card popular in Asia Pacific. This card works on the Cryptographically Secure Off-Chain Multi-Asset Instant Transaction (CS-OCMIT) network. The card converts crypto to fiat automatically when you make purchases.\\nThe TenX crypto debit card has been in the works since late last year. It is a simple way to exchange crypto assets for fiat currencies. However, TenX is facing many obstacles. For one thing, 99% of businesses are hesitant to accept cryptocurrencies. Secondly, currency exchange through a centralized exchange bank can take days. TenX uses a decentralized exchange, a network of peer-to-peer computers, to convert crypto assets to fiat currency, which is a faster way to make transactions.\\nIn addition to enabling two factor authentication, the TenX card features real-time notifications when the card is used. Users can also configure the type of coin they want to spend on different purchases. It also minimises the risk of unauthorized use of the card. Lastly, users are in control of how they spend cryptocurrency. The TenX card is secured by a private key, allowing them to control exactly how much cryptocurrency they want to spend on different purchases.\\nThe TenX debit card also has no foreign exchange or transaction fees. Its fees are largely waived when users spend at least $1,000 a year. Unlike many other prepaid cards, the TenX card is not subject to currency exchange fees. However, it does have a $1.50 issuance fee for physical cards and $5 for virtual crypto credit cards. The annual fee is $10, which is waived if you spend at least $1,000 per year on the card. The TenX card also supports ATM transactions in select countries, including APAC and certain European countries.\\nThe Embily crypto debit card lets you spend cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, in a number of ways. You can use the card to pay for goods and services around the world, as well as withdraw cash from any ATM. The Embily platform is clean and intuitive, and the company offers a comprehensive FAQ database, guides, and manuals. The company is based in Estonia, a country known for its digital innovations.\\nYou can load up to six different crypto tokens with the Embily card, and you can pay a flat 1% commission when you load the currency. Additionally, you have to pay two Euros per month to own the card. Currently, the Embily card is compatible with Apple Pay, but support for Google Pay is promised for the future. This is not yet available in the US, but if you live in that country, you can still use Embily.\\nThe Embily credit card is designed for a hassle-free experience, and is compatible with a variety of major currencies. You can top up with your preferred currency, and Embily offers a competitive exchange rate when you convert your crypto to cash. Plus, you can use the Embily card wherever Visa is accepted, reducing the time and hassles associated with using a traditional bank. The Embily platform also features online financial management tools and a customer support hotline.\\nAn eToro crypto debit card allows you to purchase Bitcoin with a credit or debit card. It can be used in retail stores and internationally. Once purchased, the card can be used to access eToro’s platform. However, there are some important points to consider when purchasing this card. It’s important to keep in mind that you should never invest an amount that could affect your lifestyle. You should only invest a limited amount that you can afford to lose.\\nAn eToro crypto debit card isn’t going to be widely available in the United States, but it could improve the customer experience for its 12 million users in other countries. While it’s not necessary to purchase Bitcoin directly with a debit card, this option should boost customer satisfaction and differentiate the app from its competitors. Those in the US, South Africa, and Hong Kong may be most interested in the debit card.\\nFirst of all, eToro requires that you provide proof of identity and address. These documents must contain your full name, place of residence, and issue date. It’s also important to provide images of government-issued identification for identification purposes. These documents can also include your address or passport. You can use eToro’s website to verify your identity. You should also make sure to verify your eToro account’s email address.',\n",

He left his great inheritance to his four sisters, and their descendants. The eldest married Robert De Tatstall, Isabell married John FitzAlan, Nichola married Roger Somery, and Cecilia married Roger Monthault, insomuch as that in the 28th year of Henry the Third, Cecilia had the Castle and Manor of Rising in Norfolk with Coventry, and held many great Lordships.\\nRoger De Monthault was one of the Earl of Chester's Barons, and Seneschall of Chester in the 30th year of Henry the Third having a Charter of Free Warren dated the 26th of March of that year, and in the 33rd year of Henry the Third Geoffrey De Langley made a suit with him for diverting a stream in Coventry from its original concourse. In the 34th year of Henry the Third, he intended visiting the holy Land, and to assist him he was furnished with a large amount of money by the Monks of Coventry, for which consideration with Cecilia his wife, of whose inheritance was joined along with the Advowson of St. Michael Church, and Chapelrys thereto belonging to the said Monks in Fee Ferme, in which sale were exerted to them and to their heirs their Manor House at Cheylesmore with the enclosed Park and the Religious House, or Frier's Minor, situated near to the said Park, along with the Advowson of Sponne Hospital, having Free Liberty to the said Roger Monthault and heirs whenever they should visit Coventry for hunting and hawking within the precincts of the said Manor.\\nA Fine levied in the 34th year of Henry the Third, by Roger De Monthault a Cecilia for Warranty of the afore mentioned premises was so granted, Cecilia in her widowhood by her Deed of Release quit all he interest of the said Manor as also the Hospital and Chapel of Sponne, sometime pertaining to the Abbey of Basing in Flint.\\nAfter this in the 3rd year of Edward the First, upon the extent of the Manor after the death of Robert De Monthault, the son and heir of the afar mentioned Roger, the Manor House, with the Park, and the Mill, were valued at five Marks per annum, the rent thereto £39.9.7d.\\nIn the 9th year of the Reign of Edward the Second, the Prior of Coventry and Robert De Monthault were certified Lords of this Place which Robert, being brother and heir to Roger, the son of the last mentioned Robert with Emme his wife, and in the First year of Edward the Third levied a Fine of all Interests here, by the name of the Manor of Cheylesmore of £96.6.8d yearly rent.\\nLeofries was not only Earl of Leicester but the Earl of Mercia, and married the legendary Lady Godiva, who rode through the streets of Coventry naked, thus entering the Stratford Pedigree on the maternal side.\\nThe Pedigree is shown thus.\\nLeofricus Comes Leicester temp Ethelred Rigis Mercia AD 716\\nAlgarus Primus above 836, Wiglaff the King of Mercians.\\nAlgarus Secundus above 860, beorred King of Mercians but slain at Ketheven by\\nDanes in 870 /\\nLeofwinus Comes, about the year 1,000 under King Ethelred\\nLeofricus, Count of Mercia founder of Coventry Abbey, died 13th Conf, married\\nGoditha dau of Thorold, Earl of Leicester. /\\nAlgaraus, Earl of mercia died 1059.\\nLucia, married her first cousin Ranulphus De Bricaford, Earl of Chester\\nRanulphus, Earl of Chester. /\\nHugo, Earl of Chester, leaving no issue, his co-heiress including his sister Cecilia\\nwho married Robert De Monthault.\\nThe two are obviously the same Family as their Coat Armour is identical except that Sir Andrew had a Bordure Or for difference indicating he was a younger son.\\nThe issue of Sir Stephen Stratford and Elizabeth Monthault was John, where it is recorded that he married Maud, the daughter of Sir Henry Ceeley Knight, of the County of Nottingham.\\nThe Ceeley Family was of Norman Descent, the head of the Pedigree being :e Sire Ce Gaulle, who came over with the Duke of Normandy in 1066. From the former was descended Sir Benedict Ceeley, living during the reign of King Edward the Third, distinguishing himself under the Black Prince. His son, Sir Henry Ceeley, a large wool Merchant, purchased an Estate in the Cotswold area of Gloucestershire.\\nJohn Stratford's direct son and heir, was Henry who married Margaret Loudham whose Pedigree is as follows. Richard Barwell of the County of Leicester had a son and heir, Richard, who married Eleanor, the daughter and heiress of William Stoke. They had issue of a daughter and heiress who married Rafe Loudham. Margaret was the daughter and heiress of this marriage. At his death Henry's heir was John Stratford, who married Elizabeth Stenmarsh, the daughter of John Stenmarsh of the County of Stafford. They left issue of a son and heir Sir John Stratford.\\nSir John Stratford, was buried at the Priory of the Holy Trinity in London, an had married the daughter and heiress of Henry Eyton, by Catherine his wife. She had been the co-heiress of Thomas Langley the son of Sir Henry Langley, and it is the quartering of these Family Arms which were presented and accepted at the Herald's Visitations of Gloucestershire as previously recited.\\nDuring the Reign of Henry the Third, at Pinley, Geoff De Langley, a man of great note, at this time made it his seat, probably due to the nearness to Coventry, for in the 22nd year of Henry the Third, he had a grant from the King of certain timber and trees out of the Kenilworth Woods for the building of his house,. which became the chief seat of the Family.\\nThe first of note of the Family was in Henry the Second's time, when the King confirmed a Grant made by one Geoff De Langley, to the Monks of Combe, named Hendeberg, in the County of Warwick, and it is likely that he was the father of the afore said Geoff De Langley. The Geoff De Langley Senior was the first Marshal of the King's Household, an office normally belonging to the Earl Marshal of England in Fee, who, with the King's consent, would appoint a Knight under him to execute the same. He appeared to be so efficient at this task and thrifty that the King held him in some great respect, although others did not hold him in such awe as he cut back on allowances for the King's Table and lessened the hospitality at Court.\\nIn the 23rd year of Henry the Third's Reign, he obtained a Charter of Free Warren in all his lands and in the 26th year of Henry the Third, he attended the King on his expedition to Gascoign, where his reputation again further profited and advanced. In the 34th year of Henry the Third he obtained a Patent to his own use, dated the 29th of December, of benefit accruing by expedition of dogs throughout all the forests of England, and on the following 4th of March he became Justice of the King's Forests from the Trent southwards. A few days later he was appointed Governor of the Castle and Honour of Rockingham in Northamptonshire, and had a Licence to stop up and enclose a certain highway which interposed between his house and the woods at Pinley.\\nAn author wrote:\\nAbout these times, saith he, a certain Knight, called Geoffrey De Langley, who was Bailiff to the King and a strict Inquisitor after all trespasses committed in forests, rode through most parts of England. In which office he behaved himself with cunning, forwardness and violence, in extorting vast sums of money especially from the Northern Gentry, as that the very Auditors themselves were astonished at such a mass. And for the better carrying on this course of operation he rode with a great company of attendants, all well armed, so that if any of those against whom he proceeded did but seem to excuse themselves in a muttering way, their enemy's being Judges, he presently caused them to be cast into prison. Neither did he use any proportion in the punishment suitable to the offence, for, were it but the killing of a fawn or a hare, and that crossing the way in a man's passage, though he were a great Nobleman that did it, he would ruin him. So that his cruelty made the memory of his predecessors precious.\\nA younger son of his was in the Welsh expedition along with his brother Walter in the 41st year of Henry the Third. Walter obtained a special exemption from serving on any juries so long as he lived. He died leaving a son and heir, John De Langley, 22 years of age and a younger son Robert. Sir Henry Langley afore mentioned, was in direct descent of the afore said Geoffrey De Langley.\\nThe Family of Eyton, were living at a very early period at Eyton on the Wyldmores, and are presumed from their Armorial Bearings, to have been of the early Vassals of Pantule, Baron Wem, who was the mesne Lord of Eyton, at the time of the Domesday Book Survey. The first named of the Pedigree is Robert De Eyton, who witnessed a Grant to Robert Corbet to the Abbey of Shrewsbury, together with William, Alan, and Hugh, sons of Hugh Pantule, and Granted himself that Religious House, the lands of Buttery, during the Reign of Henry the Second. The ninth in descent from Robert was John De Eyton, Sheriff of Shropshire in 1394, who had issue of the afore mentioned Henry Eyton. Sir John Stratford and Catherine Eyton left issue of a son and heir, Robert Stratford who married Anne, the daughter and heiress of Nicholas Attwood of the County of Stafford, leaving issue of a son and heir, Richard Stratford.\\nAt the Herald's Visitations of Gloucestershire in 1543, Richard Stratford then described as of Farmcote and Hawling, replied to the College the recorded and accepted fore going Pedigree, adding the Pedigree currently living at the time. Richard Stratford, living in 1484, married Frances the daughter of Thomas Kirkeby, leaving a son and heir, John Stratford.\\nThe afore mentioned John Stratford, was known as of Farmcote, and married Margaret, the daughter of Richard Howell, dying in 1553, being at that time the Lord of the Manor of Farmcote, Hawling, Guiting Power, Temple Guiting, Sudeley, Hailes, Wyck Rissington, Upper Swell, Cold Aston, and Aston Blank. He was one of the Commissioners along with Richard Tracy responsible for the Dissolution of Hailes Abbey. His second son William, was responsible for a large number of descendants. One married into the Rouse Family of Rouse Lench, Rutters of Quinton, and on married Thomas Whitmore of the Pantry of Charles the Second, another son William was slain in a Duel by Holte of London. The second son William Stratford, married secondly into the Walwyn Family and the Arms of Stratford and Walwyn are still above the old doorway at Farmcote Manor House. This marriage amongst other descent, was responsible for the Walford Branch of the Stratford's in Herefordshire, near Ross on Wye.\\nThe Walwyn's are of very Ancient descent from Gwallain of Walwyn Castle in Pembrokeshire of which Family was Sir Philip Walwyn who had certain lands assigned to him by William Rufus. The eleventh in direct descent from Sir Philip was John Walwyn of Longford who married Agnes, the daughter and co-heir of Simon Milborne, and had nine sons and three daughters. The eighth son , George, married Anne, the daughter of Simon Beaumont Esquire of Oxfordshire, and had issue of Edward of Southam, who married Christiana, the daughter of John Stratford of Farmcote. The ninth son married Brina, the daughter of Bridges of Hall Court, having issue of Anne, who married the afore mentioned William Stratford of Farmcote.\\nThe third son of John Stratford and Margaret Howell was Richard of Hawling, whose son and grandsons married into the Cole Family, Bannisters of Turkdean, the De La Bere Family, and the Dovers of Cotswold Games fame. Through these marriages can be traced a relationship with the Bard William Shakespeare.\\nMy main concern is now to continue with the direct descent from John Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, and myself, and all i am attempting to at this point is relating to the reader the origination and relationships with other notable families.\\nThe eldest son of John Stratford and Margaret Howell, was another John Stratford, who married Margaret, the daughter of Sir Robert Tracy of Toddington in Gloucestershire. the Family of Tracy has so much history peculiar to itself that i will dwell on my maternal descent through this Family in a separate chapter later on.\\nJohn Stratford and Margaret Tracy, had a son and heir, Henry, whom I will deal with shortly. Their second son was Richard, third son George, fourth Edward, fifth Charles, and the sixth Gyles of London. Gyles and his wife both died young leaving issue of two sons. These children were fostered by his brother Anthony, whom Mr. Pullman refers to in his letter to William Dugdale mentioned earlier. Anthony became Lord of the manor of Bushley, near Tewkesbury. One of the sons was the founder of the Merevale Branch of the Stratford Family, and eventually the Earldom of Aldborough, County Kildare, in the Kingdom of Ireland. The seventh son was John, the tobacco grower, and the eighth was Anthony, Lord of the manor of Bushley, who married Margaret Haywood. they had issue and this branch settled in this place until the Manor was sold to the Dowderswell Family, and the house, namely Payn's Place.\\nHis nephew, Sir William Tracy, lived with them for a time at Bushley, and a descendent of Anthony's was killed at the Battle of Worcester, in the Royalist cause during the Civil War. An entry in the Parish register of Bushley reads.\\nAnthony Stratford, Gentleman, who although he was not buried, was not with standing, not to be forgotten, or left out of this place, for that ye remembrance of this man will not easily be forgotten. I have not heard of any man that was buried within forty years that his death was made lamented by all sorts of people than this man was. He died on horse back, riding towards Stanway in Gloucestershire and was buried in Stanway Church on the 16th of March 1608.\\nHe had married Margaret Haywood at Bushley on the 26th of April 1577. Another brother William, is not mentioned by the Herald's but in a deed of complaint he is stated as residing in Bristol, and a most unsavoury character.\\nThe son and heir of John Stratford and Margaret Tracy was Henry who married Mary the daughter of John Maire of the County of Chester. He was in London when press ganged into the Navy, and died under Capt Shackley at the Siege of Ostend, but he left issue of a son and heir John Stratford of Farmcote. This John Stratford married Mary Throgmorton, the daughter of Sir Anthony Throgmorton, thus formulating a relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh. It was probably through this relationship that the Stratford family cultivated tobacco in the Cotswolds, which of course is another story. They had five sons, George his heir, Robert who served with Sir Francis Drake and died on one of his expeditions, Anthony who emigrated to Ireland, and was possibly the gentleman described as the Governor of Fort Dungannon, John, known as John of Prestbury, and who was responsible for that branch of the Stratford's, and Henry.\\nGeorge Stratford, the eldest son and her of John Stratford and Mary Throgmorton, was known as of Sudeley. In fact he married at Didbrook Parish Church on the 1st of October 1601, Elizabeth the daughter of William Hobby of Hailles Abbey. This William Hobby was buried at Didbrook on the 17th of March 1602, aged 103 years old, making him being born in 1499. George Stratford was buried at Didbrook on the 19th of December 1632. Again there are several Cadet Branches descended from George Stratford and Elizabeth Hobby.\\nThe son and heir of the afar mentioned George and Elizabeth, was William Stratford who was baptised at Didbrook on the 25th of August 1602, and buried at Farmcote on the 13th of September 1682. He served as a Royalist during the Civil war in the 18th Regiment of Foot, and in 1640 he was described as an Ensign, with a retiring Rank of Major. He billeted Prince Rupert's Cavalry at Farmcote, and entertained the Prince their on the night prior to the Battle of Edgehill. he was sequested for £763 for his Estates by Parliament.\\nHe married firstly Anne the daughter of Moore of Payne's Farm, Cockerup, having issue by her which resulted in the Stratford Branches of Milham Post, and Swindon Village, Cheltenham, with Francis Paul Stratford, Master in Chancery of Bedford Square and Thorpe Lubenham Hall being one of his descendents.\\nWilliam Stratford married secondly Lady Magdeline Overbury, his eldest son's mother in law, and the widow of Sir Walter Overbury, and married thirdly Susannah Leigh, the widow of George Leigh of Longborough, and she was buried in the Chancel of Shipton Sollers Parish Church beside her first husband.\\nThe son and heir of William Stratford and Anne Moore was William Stratford baptised at Farmcote on the 26th of April 1635, and married at Barton on the Heath on the 30th of November 1665, Anne, the daughter of Sir Water and lady Magdeline Overbury, and being buried at Farmcote on the 23rd of July 1711.\\nHe was described in his later life as living at Little Farmcote. This Family relationship of course, relates the maternal descent with the famous mystery of Sir Thomas Overbury, who was subject of murder and intrigue in the Tower of London. The eldest son of William Stratford and Anne Overbury was baptised at Walford on the 28th of March 1668, but appears not to have survived as Walter Overbury Stratford was their heir, although there was another younger brother Thomas and a daughter Anne. the Family of Overbury will be dealt with in a later Chapter.\\nWalter Overbury Stratford, was baptised at Barton on the Heath on the 16th of December 1672, and was responsible for the financial downfall of the Main Stock of the family, and it was during his lifetime that the Farmcote Estate was Mortgaged, but in his defence he was buried at Farmcote on the 1st of July 1753 and the Estate was not finally given up until 1754, being sold in 1756.\\nWalter Overbury Stratford, married firstly Anne, the daughter of Charles Guillam of Woodmancote in 1700, having a son George who died, Mary who never married, and Anne who married William Lawrence of Sevenhampton. Anne Guillam died and Water Overbury Stratford married secondly Frances the daughter of John Bapters of Bristol, and Anne Charmont, known as Bapters, alias Draghay, with issue of nine sons.\\nThe eldest son John Overbury Stratford died in infancy, and the second son, William was baptised at Guiting Power on the 8th of September 1715, lived in London and died in 1782, leaving issue of William his son and his grandson William Samuel Stratford, Secretary of the Astrological Society, born in 1790, and the Branch eventually died out with John Farmcote Henry Stratford who provided brass's and an Altar Cross for Guiting Power Parish Church and Farmcote Chapel.\\nOther sons of Walter Overbury Stratford and Frances, were Walter, baptised 7th of April 1716, Thomas whom we shall look at later, Edward baptised 12th July 1718. Ferdinando, baptised 4th July 1719, a Surveyor, of London who Surveyed the Hawling Estates, Anthony, who went to America, baptised on the 17th of February 1720, Francis baptised 14th January 1722, and George who was baptised on the 2nd of July 1724, all at Guiting Power Parish Church. George Stratford, the youngest son, lived at Wootton Warwen, and was buried there in April 1791. He was the founder of the Birmingham and Sheffield Branches.\\nThomas Stratford, the fourth son of Walter Overbury Stratford and Frances Bapters was baptised at Guiting Power on the 9th of June 1717, and married by Banns, on the 20th of January 1745, Sarah Davis of Bisley, and resided there until his death, being buried there on the 14th of March 1784. He left issue of at least four sons, and a daughter, including William Stratford, my Great Great Great Grandfather.\\nWilliam Stratford afore mentioned was born at Bisley in 1748, and married firstly on the 28th of October 1771 at Charlton Abbott's Anne Painter, who was buried at Sevenhampton on the 10th of November 1791. They had no issue, and William married secondly on the 16th of November 1795, Mary Acock, but a baptism is recorded of a William Stratford the son of William Stratford and Mary Acock previous to their marriage on the 14th of June 1795. This afore mentioned William married and settled at Prestbury having amongst other issue Thomas, who married Mary Burford, and she died shortly after having a daughter Elizabeth, who was brought up at Sevenhampton by Sarah Ellis the sister of the said William, ie. Thomas's father. William Stratford and Mary Acock had other issue of Thomas, who is described later and Richard an Ironmonger at Condicote when he died in 1865.\\nFurther issue of this Marriage was Sarah whom I have just described, whose descendent Sandra Hands now resides at Fareham, Hants, and Martha who died very young, and Mary Acock never recovered from a difficult birth.\\nThomas Stratford my Great Great Grandfather was baptised at Sevenhampton on the 14th of April 1797, and married Mary Hill of Liskeard. He died on the 26th of march 1869, at Swindon Village, Cheltenham, the birthplace of his mother. He enlisted in the Royal Marines at Plymouth on the 22nd of January 1824, and by the 9th of March 1844 had served 21 years and was still serving, they left issue of three sons, and two daughters, one son of which was my Great Grandfather, John George Stratford who was born at East Stonehouse, Plymouth, on the 1st of August 1834.\\nJohn George Stratford joined his father on H.M.S. Druid, aged 7 years, on the 10th of August 1841, and was admitted to the Lower School. Greenwich on the 19th of August 1845. He married on the 6th of September 1855, Mary Anne Day, at St. George's, East Stonehouse. He died on the 12th of March 1867, of Pethesis at the age of 33 years. He left issue of Mary, born in 1862, who never married, Priscilla born in 1860, who married Thomas Corner of Dawlish, and my Grandfather William Richard Thomas Stratford.\\nWilliam Richard Thomas Stratford, was born at East Stonehouse on the 28th of February 1865, and married Nellie Comer of Dawlish on the 21st of December 1890. as you may have gathered, brother and sister married brother and sister. He was twice Mayor of Truro, and Lord Mayor, a Headmaster of a Public School, a Provincial Grand Master of the Grand Masonic Lodge and a friend of Edward the Eighth. He died on the 2nd of February 1953, being buried at Kenwyn, Truro, leaving issue of four sons, William O'Grady Stratford, Willie Stratford, my father Gerald Stratford, and Alan John Stratford. My father Gerald Stratford was a Brevet Colonel in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and a Headmaster, born on the 18th of February 1896, and married Frances Mabel Howland, the daughter of Leonard Howland who at that time was General Manager of the Carron Iron and Steel works in Scotland, on the 13th of July 1918, and died at Dinnington on the 1st of February 1955, leaving issue of myself and an older brother.\\nI was born at Dinnington on the 3rd of June 1934, and married Rita May Hodkin the daughter of Sydney James Hodkin a builder on the 26th of February 1955.\",\n",
       " \"What are the most common barriers to using telehealth?\\nThere are many barriers to using telehealth in healthcare. One of the most common is the lack of reimbursement from insurance companies. Many insurance companies do not cover telehealth services, or they only cover a limited number of services. This can make it difficult for patients to access care, and it can also make it difficult for providers to offer care.\\nAnother common barrier is the lack of broadband access in rural areas. This can make it difficult for patients to connect with their providers, and it can also make it difficult for providers to connect with each other.\\nAnother barrier to using telehealth is the lack of standardization. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for telehealth, and each provider has their own way of doing things. This can make it difficult for patients to know what to expect, and it can also make it difficult for providers to know how to best provide care.\\nFinally, another common barrier to using telehealth is the lack of awareness. Many people are not aware of the benefits of telehealth, and they may not even know that it exists. This can make it difficult for patients to access care, and it can also make it difficult for providers to promote their services.\\nWhat are the most common telehealth services being used?\\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the most common telehealth services being used in healthcare vary depending on the specific needs of the healthcare organization and the patient population being served. However, some of the most common telehealth services being used in healthcare today include remote patient monitoring, video conferencing, and telephonic consultations.\\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a type of telehealth service that allows healthcare providers to monitor a patient's vital signs and other health data remotely. This can be done using a variety of devices, including wearable sensors, mobile apps, and home-based monitoring devices. RPM can be used to monitor a wide range of conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory conditions.\\nVideo conferencing is another common telehealth service that is being used in healthcare. Video conferencing can be used for a variety of purposes, including patient consultations, provider training, and telehealth education. Video conferencing can be conducted using a variety of platforms, including Skype, FaceTime, and Google Hangouts.\\nTelephonic consultations are another type of telehealth service that is becoming increasingly common in healthcare. Telephonic consultations allow healthcare providers to consult with patients by phone or video chat. This type of consultation can be used for a variety of purposes, including second opinions, medication management, and disease management. Telephonic consultations are often conducted using a platform like Skype or FaceTime.\\nWhat are the most common reasons for using telehealth?\\nThere are many reasons why healthcare providers might choose to use telehealth services. Some of the most common reasons include:\\n1. Increased Access to Care: One of the biggest advantages of telehealth is that it can help increase access to care, especially for patients who live in rural or underserved areas. By using telehealth, providers can connect with patients who might not otherwise be able to receive the care they need.\\n2. Improved Continuity of Care: Telehealth can also help improve continuity of care for patients who see multiple providers or who have to travel frequently. By using telehealth, providers can stay connected with their patients and make sure that they are receiving the care they need.\\n3. Reduced Costs: Telehealth can also help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. By using telehealth, providers can avoid the need to travel to see their patients, which can save on travel costs and time. In addition, telehealth can help reduce the need for expensive diagnostic tests and procedures.\\n4. Improved Patient Outcomes: Finally, telehealth can help improve patient outcomes. Studies have shown that patients who receive care via telehealth have better health outcomes than those who do not. This is likely due to the fact that telehealth can help improve communication between patients and their providers, as well as improve continuity of care.\",\n",
       " 'Recently, in a conversation with one of the founders of Malucette, I learnt something extremely interesting — how they use Instagram voice messages when they reach out to some of the ambassadors they want to work with.\\nThat’s when I realised that voice messages are actually a hugely underrated tool when trying to create relationships with people. And it’s not like they are new — voice messages were first launched in 1980 in the US. They’ve been around for 40 years.\\nBut they’re making a comeback. Society shifted away from making calls towards sending text messages (Gen Z and millennials HATE phone calls. Some people won’t even pick up a call from an unrecognised number.) and now in a similar way, people are shifting away from writing texts to sending voice messages.\\nI can already see this in my own friend group. They’re quicker, easier to send, and you can express more emotion in a voice message than in a text. In one word, they’re more authentic.\\nAnd if there’s anything we’ve learnt here at Selling Social, it’s that to really resonate with your community today, authenticity is key.\\nLet’s learn how to use voice messages to create deeper relationships with your community.\\nWhether we like it or not, voice is back. Our friends and families are voice messaging us, podcasts are becoming more and more popular, apps like Clubhouse became an actual thing.\\nThe reason for this is that voice is an in-between between video and text — it allows us to express more emotions than in text, but without the naked-ness of video. And post-pandemic it’s a great compromise.\\nBut what matters for us that brands aren’t really on sending voice messages yet. And so when you receive one, your brain thinks it’s “from a friend”.\\nVoice messages will work because of the same reason that UGC ads work, the same reason that Reels and TikToks work — they are authentic. They aren’t mass-produced, they aren’t automated.\\nAnd so when a high-ticket ambassador or influencer receives a personalised voice message that a real person took 60 seconds to record, they are more likely to pay attention.\\nVoice messages are also a great vibe-check. You can get a really great idea of what the person behind the brand is like — it’s not for no reason that people are actually using voice notes to vet their online dates beforehand. Dating apps like Hinge have also added voice prompts to give users a better idea of what the person behind the profile is like.\\nPeople love the sound of their own name. This is the most important part — this is how the person listening to your message knows that the message is truly for them.\\nStart the message by greeting your recipient by name, like you would a friend.\\nYour tone of voice should be what you would use if you were sending a message to the guy (or girl) whose number you got at a party.\\nYou don’t want to be formal, you don’t want to be corporate — you’re trying to chat someone up! Be friendly. If you make a mistake or fumble on some words, acknowledge it “HAHA looks like I’m too excited” and move on with the message.\\nNo one likes to listen to a long voice message that goes on and on. Keep it concise. Instagram has a limit of 60 seconds, and with good reason.\\nSay something that you noticed about their feed. Something about what you noticed in a story they posted recently. Something that shows them that you’re actually paying attention, and they’re not just a to-do item to check off.\\nThis goes a long way. The same thing applies for sending a cold DM as well.\\nThis is important. Your message has a purpose. State it.\\nMake it clear to the other person why you’re reaching them, what you want them to do, and what’s in it for them.\\nThis is where you want to be different from how you would be if you were voice messaging a friend.\\nEnd the message like you would an old-school voice message — “alright, have a great day! bye bye!”\\nFor all kinds of practical information such as email IDs or specific instructions, send a text. That way it’s more clear.\\nYou don’t want to go in and hit the record button completely unprepared.\\nIn order to prepare to send out your voice messages to your prospects, I recommend writing bullet points about the things you want to cover, but not scripting it outright. You still want to maintain some spontaneity when recording.\\nYou’re not going to be sending voice notes to every ambassador or influencer you want to reach out to, otherwise you’re going to go crazy and spend all day!\\nLeaving voice messages is bound to get your reply rate up when you’re reaching out to potential ambassadors. Have you tried using voice messages before? How have you done it? What has worked for you? I’d love to know.\\nEmail me at mayank at getubu dot com and let me know your thoughts!',\n",

       " '“Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love. For he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.”\\nWhen my paralyzing accident happened, I know the Lord took no pleasure in it. I believe it pained his heart to see me hurt, just as any father has compassion on his child. Yet I also know it pleased the Lord to permit my accident. He was as delighted then as he is now to work it all out for my good and his glory. Sound confusing? I can understand why: in some Scriptures God is described as grieving over affliction; in others it doesn’t seem to bother him.\\nDr. John Piper explains it this way: God has the capacity to look at the world through two lenses, a narrow lens and a wide-angle lens. When the Lord looks at a painful event through the narrow lens, he sees the tragedy for what it is in itself, and he is deeply grieved, as Ezekiel 18:32 says: “I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD.” He hates the isolated incident of disease, crime, or violence.\\nBut when God looks at a painful event through his wide-angle lens, he sees the tragedy in relation to everything leading up to it, as well as everything that flows from it. He has in mind Romans 8:28, “In all things God works for the good of those who love him,” and Ephesians 1:11, “…according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will.” The connections form a mosaic stretching into eternity. This mosaic—in all its parts of good and evil, dark and light—brings him delight.\\nGod often wills what he despises, because he has two lenses. You can trust him today that your painful trial is part of a pattern. One day you too will put on that wide-angle lens. When you do, what a beautiful mosaic you will see.\\nMy shortsightedness, Lord, keeps me from seeing how pain can result in good. Help me to look through the lens of faith.',\n",

The boundaries of my collection are, on one side, the Democratica series issued in 1945 (technically it’s not Italian Republic yet, but it was the ordinary series which was valid when Republic was voted in the 1946 referendum) and, on the other side, the silk envelope issued at the end of 2001, the last Italian postal object with a value in Italian Lire.\\nHow did you organize your material?\\nMy material, and therefore my site, is organised according to three specific classes:\\n– postal objects: in this part of the site the material is organised according to the typology (letters, postcards, etc.) with possible additional services (express delivery, registration, etc.) during the different periods;\\n– franking: in this part of the site there is the same material of the postal objects part, but this time sub-pages are organised according to the applied stamps;\\n– themes: in this part of the site there is only a selection of the material, for which some specific studies were performed.\\nJust to make an example: a basic fare letter franked with 25 lire stamp of Italy At Work series will be found either in the Postal Objects menu (sub-menu basic fare letter, sub-menu basic fare letter within Italy) or in the Franking Menu (sub-menu definitive series, sub-menu Italy At Work); among the themes the same object will appear a third time only in case there is a special aspect to put in evidence: a cancellation with a slogan plate, the postmark of a Travelling Post Office, a tax, a story to tell…\\nIn the pages dedicated to postal objects or to stamps, sometimes there’s a link and sometimes there isn’t: why?\\nMaybe I do not have any object which traveled with a certain stamp, or during a specific period. Maybe I already have the object, but I still haven’t had the time to scan it and to publish it in the site. I preferred to create the framework first and then, according to my availability (I’ve got a family and a job!), I will put in order what I already have and what I may purchase in the future.\\nWhy did you erase the name of some recipients?\\nI censored names and/or addresses in the postcards or in the envelopes that were given to me by friends and relatives. None of them, in fact, kindly gave me that material to see one day their own name and address published in a website. I did not have the same consideration for the material I bought: these objects were already publicly exhibited in catalogues, on ebay or in a shop.\\nIs your material on sale?\\nNo. I have an Ebay account and sometimes I sell some pieces, but the material I published here is not on sale.\\nWhere did you find the objects in your collection?\\nA part of the material comes from my own family archive: these are letters and postcards received by my parents, relatives and me through the years. Another part comes from friends and colleagues: they have been knowing for years about this passion of mine, they patiently deal with it and they kindly keep for me all the empty envelopes and the old postcards that would have been thrown away otherwise.\\nOther material was bought in markets, websites, shops, auctions.\\nWhen I started being interested in philately, a dear friend donated to me a lot of letters and postcards belonging to his collection and to his family archive: if one day I started to study and collect Postal History it’s mainly his fault. Now this friend is not with us any more, and this site is also dedicated to his memory. Thanks again, Leo!.\\nWhere did you find the information you present in the pages?\\nFor the post objects I have worked with the Catalogo Unificato di Storia Postale edizione 2011-2013 Terzo volume “Servizio Corrispondenze Repubblica Italiana”, whereas for the pages dedicated to stamps I have used the main Italian catalogues (Sassone, Unificato, CEI). When I present more detailed information I also put a specific note with the specialized bibliography I used. I also gathered in a specific page the overall bibliography.\\nCan I make references to the material which is published in your site?\\nYes. There are some basic rules, I explain them here. Since this site was created for the pleasure of sharing, without any intention of making money off of it, I limited my requests to those good manners rules that should be obvious for all the people sharing a common interest.',\n",

       " \"Offering website maintenance in your web business is the best way to establish recurring revenue, provide quality support for your clients, and build relationships so you stay in business for years to come. Featuring a website maintenance sales page on your website is the best way to begin this conversation with clients, and having a strong sales page is a key ingredient in that equation.\\nUnfortunately, most web businesses miss an opportunity with their sales pages — loading them up with way too much information, or don’t even list one at all!\\nI don’t want that to happen to you.\\nProspects are not just browsing for types of services, but also for signs of how well we work with and take care of our clients.\\nWe forget that when prospects come to our website to reach out, they are often pouring over our pages to gauge what type of company we are. They are not just browsing for types of services, but also for signs of how well we work with and take care of our clients.\\nYour website maintenance sales page is the best way to solidify that you take care of your clients and you’ll be around long after the web project is over.\\nThe best website maintenance sales pages follow a simple formula to outline the offer and why it’s right for the client\\nI’ve broken down this formula into five elements that you can follow to make sure your website maintenance sales page is positioning your company’s website maintenance plans in the best way possible:\\n- State the problem.\\n- Make the case that you offer the solution.\\n- Outline the benefits or features.\\n- Detail your plan options in a pricing table.\\n- Feature real testimonials for social proof.\\nLet’s go through each element.\\n1. State the problem\\nYou must assume that every lead or prospective client does not know the importance of keeping WordPress core and plugins up to date. As WordPress web professionals we know this, and have seen hacks because of outdated software time and time again.\\nUnless you lay out the problem in your website maintenance sales page, your prospects will never know the value.\\nI, personally, like pages with as few words as possible so I recommend presenting the problem in a blog post on your website then just highlighting the key points on the sales page. This way you can link to the blog post for those that want to dig further into the reasons why ongoing website support is important.\\nDo this: Feature one or two sentences on the problem with a few bullets points for an easily scannable piece. Include a link to a blog post that digs deeper into the problem for those who want to read more.\\n2. Make the case that you offer the solution\\nAfter stating the problem, it’s time to outline that the support you offer is the solution to this problem. Emphasize what makes your company unique in offering this solution. This could include your experience, your speciality or your unique value proposition as a company.\\nDo this: Include one to two sentences on the solution you offer.\\n3. Outline the maintenance plan benefits or features\\nNext, it’s time to break down the features of your website maintenance plans, but not in a pricing table … yet. Take this time to explore the benefits of what someone receives by signing up for ongoing website support, not just line items of what they “get.”\\nFor example, your plan may offer a set amount of development time for support tasks, but the real benefit here for the client is the peace of mind they get sending an issue to a support ticket desk and knowing it will be taken care of.\\nDo this: Explain the most important benefits or features that your maintenance plans offer. A grid format of three or six benefits works best.\\n4. Detail plan options in pricing table\\nNow that you’ve outlined the benefits, you can break down the plan options in a pricing table to showcase for your prospect the options they have for website support.\\nIt’s common to lay out three plans varying in levels of support. The basic plan offering the bare bones support you supply clients, and the premium being the fully loaded version. Often clients fall right in the middle, so make that middle plan your sweet spot with what you believe most clients look for in ongoing website support.\\nIf you are at a loss of what to include in your pricing table, I strongly recommend you look at ManageWP and the features that they offer. Using a tool like ManageWP to deliver website support will also help you define what features to offer for website support on top of your unique offerings.\\nDo this: Create a pricing table with up to three plans with tiered pricing. Make sure the plans outline what’s not included in one and included in the other so prospects can easily tell what sets each tier apart.\\nIf you're not sure about the best way to price things, this guide will help you decide which pricing model is best for your web design business.\\n5. Include real testimonials for social proof\\nFinally, feature testimonials from your clients about how having website support has benefitted their company or how they’ve enjoyed working with you.\\nWebsite maintenance is all about trust.\\nIf you’ve yet to work with a prospect on a website project, they won’t know that you take pride in your work, respond to emails and work to keep the website running well. Testimonials are a great way to begin the trust process with the prospect.\\nIf you’ve yet to collect testimonials, the response you will get from sending a simple email to your clients might surprise you. More often than not, clients are happy to supply a testimonial as long as you give an example, specify the ideal length and a deadline by which you need it by.\\nDo this: Include at least three testimonials from real clients about the benefit of a website maintenance plan or their experience working with you. Listing a testimonial with just a first name and last initial looks fake and works against you. Make sure to feature the company’s logo/avatar as well as their website link to add credibility.\\nSome additional points to note…\\nA few things to remember as you set off to construct your website maintenance sales page for the first time, or re-work what you already have:\\nDon’t copy and paste content from other mass-market website maintenance sites or competitors. Make the words your own and put in your own voice. Inject what makes you unique into your copy and stand apart from the rest!\\nDon’t feel pressured to put your pricing public — that isn’t the point here. You don’t need to specify your pricing if that is not part of your business model. Just letting your leads know these plans exist after a website is launched will start the conversation. After which, you can include pricing in your proposals.\\nDon’t assume leads will sign up through your sales page. The website maintenance sales page is there for positioning; you will still need to sell these to your client throughout the proposal process or after a website is launched. You might need to work with clients on a project first before they agree to ongoing care, or create an initial evaluation and website cleanup plan to solidify trust. Just make sure to let them know after a website is launch or evaluated that they need to move onto a care plan for further support.\\nDo offer a “cancel any time” policy. With the ability for the client to cancel their ongoing website support at anytime, you encourage more signups and the ability to prove you will deliver the goods. In my five years of offering ongoing website maintenance plans, I’ve never seen this abused in my own business.\\nDo require a paid evaluation of a website you didn’t build before allowing them to sign up for a care plan. It’s not fair to you or the client to agree to support a website without fully looking under the hood and fixing issues that will poise a problem further down the road.\\nReady? It’s time to build your website maintenance sales page!\\nCreate your website maintenance sales page so you don’t miss out on any potential clients who are browsing your website to see if you are a good fit for their business.\\nMost importantly, refine your offer with the tips listed above so you feel confident about the ongoing plans. A great website maintenance sales page will reflect that you are a business owner who is concerned about their clients’ websites and works to provide quality support on an ongoing basis.\",\n",
       " 'Along with a billion Muslims across the globe, I turn to Mecca in Saudi Arabia every day to say my prayers. But when I visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the resting place of the Prophet Muhammad, I am forced to leave overwhelmed with anguish at the power of extremism running amok in Islam’s birthplace. Non-Muslims are forbidden to enter this part of the kingdom, so there is no international scrutiny of the ideas and practices that affect the 13 million Muslims who visit each year.\\nLast week, Saudi Arabia donated $100 million to the United Nations to fund a counter terrorism agency. This was a welcome contribution, but last year, Saudi Arabia rejected a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council. This half-in, half-out posture of the Saudi kingdom is a reflection of its inner paralysis in dealing with Sunni Islamist radicalism: It wants to stop violence, but will not address the Salafism that helps justify it.\\nLet’s be clear: Al Qaeda, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Boko Haram, the Shabab and others are all violent Sunni Salafi groupings. For five decades, Saudi Arabia has been the official sponsor of Sunni Salafism across the globe.\\nMost Sunni Muslims around the world, approximately 90 percent of the Muslim population, are not Salafis. Salafism is seen as too rigid, too literalist, too detached from mainstream Islam. While Shiite and other denominations account for 10 percent of the total, Salafi adherents and other fundamentalists represent 3 percent of the world’s Muslims.\\nUnlike a majority of Sunnis, Salafis are evangelicals who wish to convert Muslims and others to their “purer” form of Islam — unpolluted, as they see it, by modernity. In this effort, they have been lavishly supported by the Saudi government, which has appointed emissaries to its embassies in Muslim countries who proselytize for Salafism. The kingdom also grants compliant imams V.I.P. access for the annual hajj, and bankrolls ultraconservative Islamic organizations like the Muslim World League and World Assembly of Muslim Youth.\\nAfter 9/11, under American pressure, much of this global financial support dried up, but the bastion of Salafism remains strong in the kingdom, enforcing the hard-line application of outdated Shariah punishments long abandoned by a majority of Muslims. Just since Aug. 4, 19 people have been beheaded in Saudi Arabia, nearly half for nonviolent crimes.\\nWe are rightly outraged at the beheading of James Foley by Islamist militants, and by ISIS’ other atrocities, but we overlook the public executions by beheading permitted by Saudi Arabia. By licensing such barbarity, the kingdom normalizes and indirectly encourages such punishments elsewhere. When the country that does so is the birthplace of Islam, that message resonates.\\nI lived in Saudi Arabia’s most liberal city, Jidda, in 2005. That year, in an effort to open closed Saudi Salafi minds, King Abdullah supported dialogue with people of other religions. In my mosque, the cleric used his Friday Prayer sermon to prohibit such dialogue on grounds that it put Islam on a par with “false religions.” It was a slippery slope to freedom, democracy and gender equality, he argued — corrupt practices of the infidel West.\\nThis tension between the king and Salafi clerics is at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s inability to reform. The king is a modernizer, but he and his advisers do not wish to disturb the 270-year-old tribal pact between the House of Saud and the founder of Wahhabism (an austere form of Islam close to Salafism). That 1744 desert treaty must now be nullified.\\nThe influence that clerics wield is unrivaled. Even Saudis’ Twitter heroes are religious figures: An extremist cleric like Muhammad al-Arifi, who was banned last year from the European Union for advocating wife-beating and hatred of Jews, commands a following of 9. 4 million. The kingdom is also patrolled by a religious police force that enforces the veil for women, prohibits young lovers from meeting and ensures that shops do not display “indecent” magazine covers. In the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the religious police beat women with sticks if they stray into male-only areas, or if their dress is considered immodest by Salafi standards. “This is not an Islam that the Prophet Muhammad would recognize”.\\nSalafi intolerance has led to the destruction of Islamic heritage in Mecca and Medina. If ISIS is detonating shrines, it learned to do so from the precedent set in 1925 by the House of Saud with the Wahhabi-inspired demolition of 1,400-year-old tombs in the Jannat Al Baqi cemetery in Medina. In the last two years, violent Salafis have carried out similar sectarian vandalism, blowing up shrines from Libya to Pakistan, from Mali to Iraq. Fighters from Hezbollah have even entered Syria to protect holy sites.\\nTextbooks in Saudi Arabia’s schools and universities teach this brand of Islam. The University of Medina recruits students from around the world, trains them in the bigotry of Salafism and sends them to Muslim communities in places like the Balkans, Africa, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Egypt, where these Saudi-trained hard-liners work to eradicate the local, harmonious forms of Islam.\\nWhat is religious extremism but this aim to apply Shariah as state law? This is exactly what ISIS (Islamic State) is attempting do with its caliphate. Unless we challenge this un-Islamic, impractical and flawed concept of trying to govern by a rigid interpretation of Shariah, no amount of work by a United Nations agency can unravel Islamist terrorism.\\nSaudi Arabia created the monster that is Salafi terrorism. It cannot now outsource the slaying of this beast to the United Nations. It must address the theological and ideological roots of extremism at home, starting in Mecca and Medina. Reforming the home of Islam would be a giant step toward winning against extremism in this global battle of ideas.\\nEd Husain is an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior adviser to the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.–Assyrian International News Agency',\n",

       " 'Sweta Ranjan | June 8, 2015\\nRanjan Dhawan, executive director of Bank of Baroda, was entrusted with the additional charge of the managing director and CEO of the public sector banking giant on February 27. Before joining BoB as executive director in November 2012, he was the chief general manager of Punjab National Bank. With its vast network, BoB is a crucial player for financial inclusion. Excerpts from an interview with Sweta Ranjan:\\nUnder the PMJDY, millions of accounts have been opened but transaction remains an issue. So, what next?\\nThe intention of Jan-Dhan Yojana was that the government would have accounts readily available for various benefits it is contemplating, for example, fuel subsidies of various kinds. So, the accounts are now ready and now this [transaction] has to be [initiated] by a lot of activities. We assume and hope that in times to come these activities will take place. I was recently in Chandigarh and I was told that in one or two areas and in one or two schemes money has already started flowing and accounts are now being credited with the amount. In one scheme Rs 30 crore is being credited per month. We find from our practical experience that people don’t withdraw this money because they feel amounts are as for two or three months and then withdraw a good amount. I think activity has started.\\nIs this scheme a matter of compulsion, or do banks see a business interest in it?\\nWe – at least public sector banks [PSBs] – have taken up this challenge in national interest. We do feel that every family in the country should have an account and we did it with will and enthusiasm. It is correct that these accounts are not remunerative as yet. Until and unless people have balance in their accounts, they will not be so. We have spent a lot of money in opening these accounts and we will spend a lot of money on the IT systems and other things for holding and maintaining these accounts. We hope that going forward these accounts will also become remunerative for the bank.\\nDo you see business viability in working with the poor?\\nI think it is an investment for the future. If we believe that this country will have 6.5 or 7 or 8 percent growth, it is going to pull millions and millions out of poverty and into the lower middle class. These people will require bank accounts which will have money in it. I do believe this has created a base for the PSBs to acquire good customers in the future. This future may occur two to three years later, or five to seven years later.\\nWhat about mobile banking for financial inclusion, the way it has been done in some African countries?\\nMobile banking is mainly successful for funds transfer in Kenya. They had a system called M-Pesa. There is an ecosystem which has been set up. For example, if a poor person wants to transfer money to his village, there are various kinds of shops. He would give his money to one shop, there would be mobile transfer of his money to the shop near his village and somebody from his family can come and collect this money.\\nI believe that banking of the future is going to be mobile banking. Even today people prefer to do their internet shopping or internet travel [booking] through the mobile phone. Increasingly people do not access the internet on the PC. Funds transfer will occur – is also occurring – via internet through the mobile, also through a lot of apps. For example, Bank of Baroda has developed an app: Baroda m-connect. If I want to do banking, all I do is just use this app conveniently.\\nThis is very convenient but will it suit the poor who are not tech-savvy?\\nIt will suit them because it is very user-friendly. Secondly, the handset cost, even of smartphones, has come down drastically. The only handicap, to some extent, will be for illiterate people. I am sure that over a period of time, some solution will be worked out and we would have a process which will help the illiterate transfer their money. We can have self-explanatory icons. Secondly, not many people realise this but even the illiterate people are ‘numerate’, they can read numbers. This is the technology whose time has come.\\nHow sustainable is the existing ATM infrastructure to handle the increased workload from new accounts?\\nOur ATM infrastructure is getting upgraded rapidly. About two years back Bank of Baroda had 2,200 ATMs, today we have more than 7,000. I am now seriously looking at the possibility of adding 3,000 ATMs under a different model. I will not disclose what this model is. But, yes, the ATM infrastructure in the country is rapidly expanding and now penetrating even the rural areas.\\nIt is not the case that an ATM would be viable in every rural area and for that we also have the business correspondent (BC) model, which is working. Any new technology, any new process takes time to stabilise. We must remember that even the BC model was floated about five years back, and it has taken four to five years to stabilise.\\nThere is no magic wand: it has its teething problems, technological problems. For example, in rural areas, typically connectivity is very weak. It has taken time to solve the connectivity problem. One of the ways we have done so is through satellites. Satellite (connectivity) is available anywhere and everywhere, wherever you may be. It is expensive. So, there are problems of expenses, there are problems of technology absorption also, because if you make a transaction through some other route then you have to change and upgrade your technology over here. Because technology is hitting the data sever in Mumbai. How do we recover the transaction if the data link breaks? There are a lot of technological problems we face. We are working on them. What gives hope is the fact that over the last five years we have solved most of such problems.\\nYour bank had opened 56 lakh accounts by mid-February. Did you face any staff shortage or infrastructure problems?\\nOne problem that has occurred during opening accounts under the Jan-Dhan Yojana is that we have not carried out normal development work that we do. Our job is to serve customers. The normal banking development work, to some extent, took a back seat because the entire branch staff was concentrating on opening the Jan-Dhan accounts.\\nSo, staff strength was an issue…\\nNo. There have been no issues. The branch staff was almost exclusively deployed to open the Jan-Dhan Yojana accounts. So, some of the targets, for example in retail lending, have not been achieved – especially in loans.\\nDoes your bank have any tailor-made schemes for Jan-Dhan customers?\\nAs of now we don’t have any tailor-made scheme. Our focus has been on opening accounts. In time to come when we find out what the demand on the ground is, we will certainly have some schemes.\\nSix months after opening an account a customer can avail overdraft facilities. Do banks have ample funds and infrastructure for it?\\nCertainly, we have put up a very good structure on the ground. On the manpower front we have appointed a huge number of business correspondents who are doing a very good job. Our backend process is also now in line. We have a separate server for the Jan-Dhan accounts. So, the entire structure is in place, and we can handle this.\\n(The interview appears in the June 1-15, 2015 issue)\\nSnakes, Drugs and Rock ’N’ Roll: My Early Years By Romulus Whitaker with Janaki Lenin HarperCollins, 400 pages, Rs 699\\nThe Moral Contagion By Julia Hauser and Sarnath Banerjee HarperCollins, 140 pages, Rs 699 The world has lar\\nAddressing the Viksit Bharat Viksit Uttar Pradesh program in Lucknow on Monday, prime minister Narendra Modi launched 14,000 projects across the state, worth more than Rs 10 lakh crore at the fourth groundbreaking ceremony of UP Global Investors Summit held in February 2023.

The city’s fleet crew sheltered in place for three days to work on first responder units and brush trucks for recovery efforts. There was no fleet facility damage, and only minor window damage to some cars.\\nReplenishing fuel for generators was the biggest concern. “We used our fuel trucks to do that, and also made sure we kept the fueling station for our first responders,” said Jim Davis, director of fleet maintenance.\\nAbout 350 vehicles in the City of Houston fleet were impacted by the hurricane, with 280 considered a total loss. Many of these vehicles were used by first responders in the Police, Fire, and Public Works Departments, though some were parked in garages and lots in downtown Houston. One of the fleet’s 25 maintenance facilities was inundated with water and is considered a total loss. The rest experienced little to no damage.\\nFleet’s primary role was maintaining fuel levels for emergency operations, and quickly servicing and repairing emergency response vehicles. Staff worked 24 hours a day during the storm to keep emergency responders moving and saving lives. Although debris cleanup is expected to continue for months, during which time fleet will continue maintaining Solid Waste equipment, most fleet operations are back to normal.\\nThe City of Tampa fleet had minimal damage to its facility, with vehicle damage still being assessed. Fleet assigned two technicians and a mobile truck to each of the city’s emergency response centers.\\nA 12-man crew stayed at the fleet maintenance facility before and during the hurricane for rapid support of tires, parts, and maintenance. Fleet staff also played a substantial role in emergency fuel planning and delivery, monitoring fuel at seven sites before and during the storm.\\nBefore the storm, the Palm Beach County fleet ensured road clearing equipment, dump trucks, and other response equipment were ready to use and ensured over 100 emergency generators around the county were at maximum fuel level. After the storm, fleet continued refilling these generators until power was restored. Only one fleet vehicle has been identified with damage so far, and the fleet’s facilities sustained minor damage.\\nMiami-Dade County’s fleet suffered power losses, some flooding, and one vehicle with notable damage from a downed tree. Alex Alfonso, fleet management division director for Miami-Dade County, said major challenges included maintaining power at facilities and maintaining communication at the fleet’s automated fuel sites. In some cases, fleet personnel manually dispensed fuel to county vehicles. Fuel was also difficult to source, due to refineries shutting down after Harvey and the limited availability of transport carriers before Irma.\\nRead more about the fleet impact from Hurricane Irma here.',\n",

Last year at this time, the 30-year fixed-rate Nashville mortgages averaged 6.18%. The 30-year FRM has not been lower since the week ending May 10, 2007, when it averaged 6.15%. The 15-year FRM averaged 5.83% with an average 0.5 point, down from the previous week when it averaged 5.88%. A year ago, the 15-year FRM averaged 5.91%. The 15-year FRM has not been lower since the week ending February 2, 2006, when it averaged 5.81%.\\n“Both the producer price index and the consumer price index remained contained in October while industrial production fell,” said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist. “This allowed interest rates for the 30-year FRM to decline to the lowest levels since early May 2007 and the 15-year FRM to fall to a level not experienced since early last year.”\\nThe current condition of the Nashville real estate market really lends itself to those who are willing to take small risks. We have been able to find several sellers who are nervous enough to sell way below the true market value allowing our clients to make a handsome profit.

       " '<p>Gustave Klimt (1862-1918) is widely regarded as one of the most talented artists of the 20th century. Born in Austria and one of the founders of the Vienna Secession, his unique and beguiling style spans from Byzantium art to Expressionist-inspired portraits.<p> <p>Klimt is best known for The Kiss (1907). It\\'s a profoundly symbolic and highly sensual piece. Klimt augmented the oil canvas painting of converging lovers with metals, including platinum, silver, and gold leaf. The effect is an extraordinary piece that is impossible to forget.<p> <p class=\"title-4\">Gustav Klimt in Context</p> <p>To fully understand the timeless work of Gustav Klimt, we need to place him within his context. The Vienna of the late 19th century was a conservative and uptight place. Victorian-era social and moral attitudes, such as modesty, family values, and sexual oppression abounded.<p> <p>Klimt initially worked within this framework. However, his work was deeply symbolic and often explored erotic themes and the female body. His choice of theme and subject matter can be viewed as a rejection of the Viennese social mores of his time.<p> <p>While classical and naturalistic styles were popular in this period, Klimt went in the other direction. He sought to express dreams and sensuality, though his rebellion caused much consternation at the time. Indeed, his last public commission — the paintings Philosophy, Medicine and Jurisprudence — were savaged for their perceived lewdness.<p> <p class=\"title-4\">Characteristics of Gustav Klimt wall décor</p> <p>Seen through a modern-day prism, the work of Klimt does not appear overly sexual or crude. As he matured, he turned his gaze towards landscapes and, on occasion, society women draped in fur and adorned with gold leaf. For many, this era represents the peak years of his output.<p> <p>However, despite shifts in style, some constants remain. In particular, spirals, swirls, gold embellishments, and thinly disguised psychosexual imagery are all hallmarks of Klimt\\'s inimitable style.<p> <p class=\"title-4\">What spaces suit Gustav Klimt wall art?</p> <p>While Klimt\\'s approach was very forward-looking, his art is rooted in a particular time and space. Gustav Klimt wall décor can work in a variety of rooms. The style, especially his portraits, retain enough connection to early 20th-century realism that they work in almost any environment. However, his more Byzantium or Orientalist-inspired pieces can fight for space within the most opulent rooms.<p> <p>Explore our collection of Gustav Klimt wall décor when you need something eye-catching and hedonistic with a refined edge.<p>\\n<p>Oil on canvas by Gustav Klimt, 1901.</p>\\nBring high quality wall art into your home or office with a canvas print that will never warp or sag.

And what if every time you complained, fixed a bug just for you?\\nThe Chinese hset maker, Xiaomi, has built an empire of 100 million users worldwide on this exact premise. “’re an Internet company,” said Bin n, esident of Xiaomi, at a press event on Thursday. “’re not just interested in making hsets.”\\nile it’s true that Xiaomi has been particularly successful selling directly to customers rather than through other retailers or carriers, that’s not what n was referring to. He was boasting about the company’s massive user base overseas, which has grown rapidly thanks to savvy social media tactics. “They are not our customers, they are our fans,” added Hugo Barra, a former executive who left in 2012 to serve as Vice esident of Global Operations at Xiaomi.\\nXiaomi has gone to great lengths to accommodate these “fans.” For instance, when the company launched its first ROM in 2010, there were only 100 users, but after it started making devices its marketshare grew, Xiaomi honored those that had stuck with them from the beginning by printing their name in the MIUI boot loader.\\nThen there was the time a fan requested that Xiaomi make it easier to turn on the flashlight from the ck screen. He argued that his parents wouldn’t have caught him coming home drunk if he wouldn’t have made such a racket dropping his keys. A week later, the developers pushed out a software update that included that exact feature. “Everything we do is with social as a platform,” said Barra. “Every market we enter has its differences, but at the core everyone is social, everyone is emotional, everyone loves to be spoken to—to be marketed at.”\\nXiaomi in the\\nXiaomi’s entrance into the U.S. mobile market will incorporate some of the tactics that have made it famous overseas. though the company won’t initially sell phones tablets—Barra said “the amount of effort required to bring those products to market is significant”—it does plan to appeal to U.S. customers (sorry, fans) in a similar manner. Barra cited its recent success in India. “en we entered India, we didn’t know how things were going to turn out. India got it. They understood what we were coming to market with… were bringing more than anyone had ever brought.”\\nUnlike India, the already has “more.” It has Apple, Samsung, HTC, , Microsoft, a whole array of manufacturers vying for marketshare. It also has carriers; most customers don’t buy smartphones tablets directly from the manufacturer when they can get the device subsidized from their cellular provider. There’s incentive there that Xiaomi will have to compete with, not to mention a pattern that users have become accustomed to ever since mobile phones became a necessity.\\nThere’s also the question of how Xiaomi plans to market to the everyman—users that aren’t necessarily “in the know,” but who do a little research for their bi-annual phone upgrades. I asked Barra about this—about how he’d get someone like my Mom onboard the Xiaomi train— he bluntly answered, “You’ll buy her one.” Essentially, Xiaomi is banking on its existing “fans” to convert their friends family members, too.\\nUnfortunately, we won’t get to see Xiaomi’s plan in action for some time, since it’s limited on what it can sell here in the U.S. But the company is very optimistic about its future stateside. “Building a fan base [in the U.S.] is no different than how we built a fan base in India,” said n. “Driving marketshare having a great experience…is really the most important goal for us.”',\n",

       " 'In my working experience, autocross can be a really exciting and thrilling sport. I have participated in a number of occasions in my community location. I observed the passion to be quite addictive as well.\\nOut of all my other hobbies, I believe this just one is the best “bang for the buck” as far as thrills go with your motor vehicle. Every person can take part. Each and every motor vehicle (some golf equipment have exceptions to this nevertheless like no SUV’s, no Trucks) can race. The awesome thing about this kind of race is that you are competing versus other folks in your course typically defined by the SCCA, having said that, you are on the training course by itself so there is negligible opportunity of hitting other cars. Just Divorce help families when there are disputes around wills and probate.\\nThe hardest section about autocross (apart from understanding how to race) in my feeling is getting the suitable vehicle. Absolutely sure, you can use a each day driver, but that is not advised if you are going to take part in a number of activities a year. Autocross can build put on on the tires and other elements very speedily and can get highly-priced pretty rapidly. I would advise to get a motor vehicle that you can use for autocross. This can be a “trailer auto” or a car or truck that you can nonetheless generate on the road, but use only for this hobby.\\nThere are 4 important parts to take into account when choosing a motor vehicle for autocross:\\n1) What sort of motor vehicle to get\\n2) The Price of the car or truck\\n3) The overall affliction of the vehicle (if made use of)\\n4) Aftermarket upgrades/modifications\\nWHAT Form OF Automobile TO GET FOR AUTOCROSS:\\nFor autocross racing, some individuals would suppose that the car has to be extremely impressive, compact, 2 doors and modified. This is not completely accurate. While that variety of motor vehicle would be pleasant, it is not demanded to be aggressive in autocross.\\nBear in mind that most autocross gatherings and clubs have the automobiles grouped in to some sort of class. The club I participate with follow the SCCA Course suggestions. The classes aid group the vehicles so the same “stage” of autos can remain aggressive in each course.\\nThis is done to steer clear of the “greatest and fastest is very best” point out of considered. It would be unfair to put a closely modified Porsche GT3 up versus a inventory Ford Concentration. This is why they do that.\\nSo, to decide the ideal automobile for autocross, you would in all probability want a coupe or convertible 1st if attainable. Sedans can operate nicely way too, but some sedans are not geared for modifications, though, the activity sedans of nowadays are truly beginning to acquire about.\\nHandbook transmission would be advisable, nevertheless, if you have an computerized that is Okay much too. You could want to look at trading it for a handbook in the foreseeable future to continue being competitive. Once more, there are even now “sport shift” sort automatics out there that are obtaining greater and greater each and every working day.\\nPreferably, you would also want a rear-wheel drive motor vehicle for autocross. RWD autos commonly provide greater command and handling in most cases. I know some fans out there will disagree with me, but that’s Ok. On the other hand, I have employed many front-wheel generate autos that run with the best of them.\\nThe cost of buying a automobile for autocross is generally the aspect for me. I, like a lot of other folks, cannot find the money for an costly car or truck for autocross. There are, even so, those that can pay for it and price tag is nevertheless something for them to consider.\\nThe $-$5000 variety:\\nThis is the assortment most of us newcomers want to commence. Of system, no cost is Good, but look at the 3rd element (all round problem) when this option comes to brain. Numerous automobiles that can conduct perfectly and have a great deal of upgradable possibilities are the next:\\n1989-1997 Mazda Miata – Quite great electric power to bodyweight ratio. It is Incredibly well-known at autocross. 1979-1991 Mazda RX7 – Quick small car or truck, handles effectively. Several updates accessible. 1989-1998 Nissan 240sx – Many aftermarket updates, handles very effectively. 1990-1999 BMW 3 Sequence – Quite versatile car. You can find quite great models in this assortment now. 1988-2000 Honda Civic/CRX – I have viewed several types compete well in autocross. 1984-1999 Toyota MR2 – Minimal centre of gravity, great general performance, mid motor. 1990-1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse/Eagle Talon – Lots of updates, some models Turbo AWD. 2000-2007 Ford Emphasis – Really competitive automobiles. SVT styles obtainable in selling price variety. 1997-2003 VW Golfing – Hatchbacks often like autocross. VR6 styles out there in selection. 1990-1999 Acura Integra – Like the Civic, really aggressive with quite a few upgrades out there.\\nThere could be a few much more cars that I skipped that fall less than this price selection. The system I use to hunt for cars can fluctuate depending on the form I am searching for. I will use nearby categorized ads, Craigslist. I will also use the bigger motor vehicle lookups and develop my general “looking” area. I have effectively located great vehicles using VEHIX, AutoTrader as effectively as Government Auction Web pages.\\nBut what about the autocross vehicles above the $5000 vary? Very well, I am happy you are feel that for the reason that I am about to record them beneath.\\nIf you have some money to work with and want to get something more recent, you can contemplate the subsequent autos:\\nThe $5,001-$20,000 selection:\\nThis assortment can involve more recent cars as effectively as pre-owned vehicles that are no much more than a couple of several years aged. Recall, cars and trucks typically depreciate very quickly, so as the a long time go by, some of the more recent cars can be in just access for fewer money and are wonderful for autocross. The cars and trucks underneath occur to mind in this vary:\\n1998-Latest Mazda MX-5 – Continue to same basic vehicle, but much more energy as they obtained more recent. 2003-Present-day VW Golfing – Even more modified than the former versions, contend effectively. 1992-1997 Mazda RX7 – 3rd Gen is twin-turbo and can compete in autocross. 1992-2006 BMW M3 – M3’s are created for racing. Some more recent versions will drop in this assortment. 1998-2003 BMW M5 – M5’s are really highly effective and compete in their course properly. 1994-Present Ford Mustang/Cobra – Extremely adaptable automobile. Competes properly in class. 1994-2002 Camaro/Firebird – Competes perfectly in class. Many autocross updates. 2007-Present Mazda Mazdaspeed3 – Turbo, hatchback, competes properly in autocross. 2003-2008 Nissan 350z – Fantastic autocross motor vehicle, quite well-known on the keep track of. Specific Autocross Kit autos this kind of as the V6 Stalker fall in this array as well.\\nNow, this cost selection can change in vehicles. A whole lot of these cars are nevertheless new and could have to have financial loans to buy them.\\nThe $20,001 spectrum will consist of some of the current-working day versions as well as the noticeable “tremendous vehicles” we all respect this sort of as the Corvette, Viper, Porsche, Ferrari, Lotus and other folks. I will not incorporate a listing for these because if you are obtaining one particular of individuals for an autocross motor vehicle, you did your investigation.\\nOver-all Issue OF THE Automobile (Used):\\nWhen getting a 2nd vehicle for autocross, address it like when you are purchasing your each day driver automobile. You want the motor vehicle to be fairly free of significant issues. Autocross racing can set strain on the car’s body, the suspension, the brakes, the tire and the total physique of the motor vehicle.\\nYou want to be sure that the motor vehicle has not been in any significant incidents. Body mend or body injury can be extremely harmful mixture when you autocross. That is the MOST crucial point to test for when buying a auto for autocross. I have skilled and made use of the service by Experian named AutoCheck. They offer you an unlimited amount of VIN checks for one particular of their service selections and the rate is way improved than the other products and services out there. I have utilized it when shopping and comes in extremely helpful when you are checking the heritage of a car.\\nThe up coming crucial product to check on the automobile is major ingredient difficulties this sort of as smoke coming out of the back again of the exhaust, main oil leaks (small leaks are envisioned on most made use of cars) slight/major overheating of the engine. Autocross is exterior and you push the automobile to the limit. You want the important parts to be in the ideal shape they can be. The talked about troubles can leave you stranded at the keep track of if you do not search out for them.\\nI ordinarily have some expectation to do slight repair or preventive repairs on my vehicles when I am purchasing to autocross them. As I said over, small oil/fluid leaks are “Alright” and can usually be set very easily. Little leaks explain to us that the auto is just made use of and could not be suffering from the leak as a final result. Significant/significant leaks tell us the vehicle may perhaps have been neglected by the previous operator and may perhaps have residual problems unseen at the instant. When wanting at a auto, commence it up, drive it close to with the A/C engaged (even if it would not function). When you are finished with the check push, leave it idling while you walk about the auto continuing to inspect it. If the vehicle has an overheating challenge, typically this is the time it will exhibit. This idea has helped me stay clear of several lovely autocross vehicles that experienced an overheating challenge.\\nBelts and hoses are my most repeated “preventive” restore I do, even if they are not a difficulty. It is often best to know when an important part has been changed rather than to “guess” and rely on the preceding operator. H2o pumps, as well, fall in this category from time to time.\\nOne detail folks often examine when purchasing a applied auto are the tires. Of course, this is significant for an autocross automobile, but not to see how “great” the tires are, but to see if the automobile requires an alignment. Autocross is about handling and you require to be guaranteed the car’s stock “handling” capacity is where it must be.\\nWhy not stress about the tires? Well, tires must be one issue to contemplate shopping for for your autocross car to start out with, so the current tires should really be eradicated in any case. Tires are possibly the most bought don item an autocross member will buy. A lot of autocross racers will provide a set of tires for racing, just one for driving household (people who do not use a trailer) and some will even bring spares for the racing tires. This is so common that Tire Rack provides tires just for autocross. I have utilised them and they are the very best spot to get tires for this.\\nAFTERMARKET MODIFICATIONS FOR AUTOCROSS:\\nIf you at any time look into the aftermarket globe of the automobile market, you know that there are actually thousands of locations to appear and purchase. I will list a handful of places that most individuals do not assume to glimpse, but amazingly have items for the autocross supporters.\\nVery first and foremost, autocross cars and trucks do NOT often need main upgrades to be competitive. A driver can use a inventory vehicle and compete versus fellow stock automobiles and continue being aggressive. As soon as you begin to modify or enhance intensely, you may perhaps commence to go into different classes and contend with other autos that are similarly modified. Hold that in thoughts when you want to adjust anything.\\nCommonly, I say modify the effortless issues initial: Ingestion, exhaust and basic tune ups. Most autocross drivers do not go far from that. These should be the first issues you check out to update though you participate in autocross to get the most overall performance out of your car or truck.\\nIf you make your mind up to go further more to be far more aggressive, my subsequent suggestion would be suspension and body roll modifications. You should remember, sure updates in this place might adjust your course. Be sure to verify your club or teams rules with these modifications.\\nTypically, the speediest up grade to an autocross auto would be entrance and rear strut tower bars/braces. They are typically cheap to purchase and effortless to put in. They are also incredibly modular which means that when you purchase these, they will perform with other suspension elements in position (typically). This modification allows stiffen the car’s suspension and body and allows with cornering.\\nThe following modification recommendation would then be the front and rear sway bars and backlinks. These sections also assist the physique roll when cornering and handling and can occasionally be modular to the suspension system as a complete.\\nThe last suspension upgrade is ordinarily the most high priced: The struts (shocks/springs). This upgrade commonly performs effectively with the higher than objects, but ads a lot more stiffness, extra response to the managing and at times decreased the automobile in general for a lower centre of gravity.\\nAs soon as you have modified the entire suspension, my future advice would be to upgrade the brakes (at least the pads). This will help your halting potential for these times in which a faucet of the brake is necessary throughout a lap. Be sure to continue to keep in brain that high functionality brake pads generally use significantly more rapidly than OEM.\\n1 of the past issues I suggest to upgrade is the tires. Now, I am not saying that you ought to not First invest in new tires when you autocross, but I am declaring not to Update them to an autocross/race tire just nevertheless. Most autocross fanatics will tell you to get made use of to the stock/typical tires on your motor vehicle initially.\\nAfter you get used to inventory variety tires, modifying them to a race tire or softer tire will in fact strengthen your lap periods (that is the idea anyway).\\nOne previous notice. I endorse replacing the fluids in your car with as quite a few synthetics as you can. Synthetic fluids have increased heat resistance and can take the intensive moments you will be putting on the car or truck throughout the autocross laps.',\n",

       " 'Henry Kaiser has earned his Pioneer label not only by championing experimental guitar for over three decades, but by exploring the fantastical underwater playground of Antarctica. His massive output spans genres and cultures while never sounding like anyone else. He has collaborated with a who’s who of the guitar world from roots players to experimentalists like himself. His ability to conceptualize and clearly express his musical ideas in words makes for a fascinating interview.\\nEarly Henry with Dixie Dregs Andy West on whammy bar bass\\nWhat kind of music were you playing when you started out on guitar?\\nI started out doing several things at once:\\na) Experimental music: I wanted everything to be an experiment and always new.\\nb) Improvised music: 95% of what I have done and what I will do is always improvised – that’s where the life and spirit is for me in music, in improvisation.\\nc) I wanted to play the psychedelic music I grew up with in the Bay Area in the late ’60’s.\\nd) I wanted to figure out how to play my favorite sorts of world music on guitar: Malagasy, Japanese, Vietnamese, Hindustani, Chinese, Burmese, etc. I particularly wanted to play stuff on guitar that was not originally played on guitar. Roots music, not commercial music, from alien cultures. This was very appealing in the same way that science fiction novella about alien worlds were to the young me—another way to go way out there. It’s probably true that experimental music was another kind of science fiction for me, too—I don’t think that I can overstate the importance of that.\\ne) Blues being among my favorite listening material, and also so easily accessible on guitar, I wanted try to find my own voice in that. Focused throughout the music of my particular blues heroes: Hubert Sumlin, Albert Collins, Robert Pete Williams, Skip James, Harvey Mandel, Fred McDowell, and Ry Cooder.\\nf) I wanted to understand and play the music of especially favorite artists of mine: Beefheart, Mahavishnu, Rydal, Basho, Fahey, etc.\\nToday I do exactly the same things that I started doing in the first day that I got my first guitar, a Telecaster, in 1972.\\nI guess I am the three things that I wanted to be: An improvising guitarist, psychedelic guitarist (in the sense that what comes out of my guitar should be mind-expanding, and an experimental guitarist. Putting those three things together is what all the years spent with guitars has been about for me.\\nWhat led you to create experimental and improvised music?\\nI think it was the LP and radio listening I did before I played guitar. Also the many concerts I went to as a young teenager, non-commercial, underground, and listener-sponsored radio of the 1970’s, as well as the Bay Area music scenes. What floated to the top for me were the particular qualities of music that was improvised and experimental; no matter what the genre or idiom. It’s what was in the air all around me in my formative years.\\nWhose music inspires you?\\nConlon Nancarrow, Gyorgy Ligeti, Morton Feldman, Iannis Xenakis, Toru Takemitsu, and everyone I mention in this interview, especially those I have collaborated with.\\nHow did you get better at your current style?\\nAt this point it seems to be conceptual. I have never really chosen to practice at all. Technique that I desire came vary easily. Most any theoretical music info is out there and easily accessible. I really only play guitar in the studio, at a gig, and if I am repairing or optimizing individual instruments.\\nI think the expanding LISTENING, seeking out new unheard recordings and types of music to listen to is really what helps me get better the most. New concepts and ideas are what I look for. The best and most productive ones are things that cannot be written about or put in music notation. Things that cannot be described in terms of melody/harmony/rhythm—that’s where music and style is for me. I do think reading a lot of what ones musical heroes, and even enemies have to say in print can be enlightening too. I guess I am always looking for new little enlightenments. I seem to get better in quantum enlightenments, not with gradual improvement.\\nWhat are you trying convey with your music?\\nNothing much that I am specifically aware of, I just try to get out of the way and let the music convey what it wants to convey. I like to be surprised and I assume that the audience wants to be surprised along with me. So, I might be attempting to provide that. And I like to have fun with the music, so probably trying to provide that for the audience and me too.\\nWhat’s currently the most essential gear for you?\\na) Clean hi-fi pickups: Alembic or Bartolini or Q-Tuner\\nb) A clean hi-f amp with JBL speaker: Dumble, Two Rock, Fender, Glasswerks, Rivera, Divided by 13.\\nc) Tech 21 Comptortion distortion pedal\\nd) Ernie Ball volume pedal\\ne) A hi-fi compressor: Old World Audio 1960 or Origin Effects Cali 76\\nf) Two of these three: Eventide Eclipse, Eventide Pitch Track, TC Flashback\\ng) Ancient Lexicon PCM-42 or PSP-42 plug-in emulation of the Lexicon.\\nh) Colorsound Wah or Wilson Colorful Clone\\ni) An option that is increasingly necessary is True Temperament frets\\nGive me that stuff, and I can be my maximum self on electric. It does not really matter what individual guitar. For acoustic guitar, it does not matter much. I’m spoiled with a lot of great and favorite acoustics at home: Monteleone, Sobell, Beardsell, Turner, Howe-Orme, Bohmann, Moonstone, Bourgeois, etc. But anything with new strings will work for me.\\nWhich do you enjoy more: recording or playing live and why?\\nThey are pretty much the same for me. I feel the future audience when I play in the studio, and I somehow feel like I am playing to them. And with a live audience, I really aim to connect with them, even doing the weirdest stuff. Solo and ensemble improvising are also equally fun for me. But if I had to choose one, I would always go for interacting with other players in real time. A lot of my use of digital guitar processing has been based on finding ways to surprise myself when playing solo, so that I feel that I am interacting with something that is outside of myself. I never have felt like I am doing any sort of self-expression in music, actually. I feel more like I just try to get out of the way, so that some cosmic message or joke gets through from Planet Zongo, or wherever.\\nHow have you built up an audience for your music?\\nWhen I first started out in the mid-’70’s, improvising and experimental musicians could easily put own their own albums through fairly effective distribution channels, and actually make surprisingly good money—at least enough to go on putting out more albums. That seems to be way more difficult now, and I don’t see it getting easier in the near future. Fairly early on I was quite present in the mainstream music media (which covered experimental things much more back then). As I made more commercial rock and jazz recordings, that allowed me to build more of an audience. A lot of film and TV soundtrack work did not build an audience, but it did help pay for more self-released things, and allow me to record things on spec, and then sell them to independent labels. Nowadays I just don’t know. How does one build and audience for experimental stuff, when good quality audio is practically absent in the commercial distribution of music? I think that experimental stuff, so often concerned with sonic detail, timbre, and color, simply does not survive to recruit new listeners in the lo-fi MP3 format.\\nWhat influences your music besides other musicians and music?\\nDuring my entire musical career I have also worked in film production and in underwater scientific research. Those other areas have always heavily affected my science fair approach to guitar and music making. Since 2001, I have been a research diver in the US ANTARCTIC PROGRAM. I think I have spent two years of my life living in a tent on the frozen Ross Sea and diving beneath the ice daily there. That kind of experience really changes everything about one’s life. But there’s not really the space to go into that here.\\nMy favorite filmmakers have always been as much an influence on the music that I play, as my musical heroes. Primary among those might be: Jordan Belson, Pat O’Neil, Akira Kurosawa, Preston Sturges, Masahiro Shinoda, and Michael Powell.\\nWith whom would you like to collaborate and why?\\nI have gotten to play or record with so many of my biggest heroes: Jerry Garcia, Derek Bailey, David Lindley, Evan Parker, Terry Riley, Cecil Taylor, Wadada Leo Smith, Richard Thompson, Sonny Sharrock, Michael McClure, Glenn Phillips, Raymond Kane, Michael Manring, Andy West, Bill Frisell, Barry Melton, David Torn, Jaojoby, Drumbo, John Stevens, Freddie Roulette, Nels Cline, The Mermen, to name just a few. Many of them have become good friends of mine and I look forward to new, future collaborations with them.\\nI love doing soundtrack work, whether it is cheap TV, or the projects that I did with Werner Herzog. I always want to do more soundtracks. It is very appealing to get that kind of work done efficiently and effectively. It’s not the easiest work to come by nowadays, as things get more and more conservative in the film and TV worlds.\\nI wish I could do more of the sort of world music collaborations that I have done in Madagascar, Norway, Korea, and Japan. But that’s not something the market really can support nowadays. I sure wish I could do a project in Burma. And more stuff with Korean musicians. David Lindley and I may go back to Madagascar in 2015 for a British TV documentary. I hope that happens.\\nA project in Iran, would be really tempting. There’s a great label there that does lots of cross-cultural projects: Hermes Records.\\nYour solo album EVERYTHING FOREVER is an 80-minute guitar solo, using your signature square wave modulated delay effect. What ever led you to doing an 80-minute solo track?\\nIt had been bothering me for a while that my last electric solo guitar piece on CD, A Little Stroke Of Light, was only 70 minutes long; when a CD can hold 80 minutes. I thought that it might stop bothering me if I did do an 80-minute solo. One take, no overdubbing, live performance. What’s going on musically and conceptually here for me is: Terry Riley, plus Evan Parker, plus Malagasy Tromba trance music, plus Xenakis type attitude towards stochastically sprayed-out clouds of notes (though quite consonant, in this case), plus square wave modulation of delay times with a couple of 30 year old Lexicon digital delays, plus Persian music structural concepts of “gushes,” staying away from rock guitar language and gestures, as well as some structural ideas from the music of Robbie Basho that were also likely to have been inspired by Persian music. When I recorded the 70-minute solo the year before, it seemed like 10 minutes had passed, subjectively speaking. This 80-minute solo felt like a 3-hour solo, while I was playing. The two projects are quite different, and I am super happy with both of them. I guess you can listen to these as background music, or in the car on a long drive. But I think they do hold up to close attention also, if a listener can maintain that kind of attention for 80 minutes. I used my parts Strat with a True Temperament neck, which produces nearly just intonation; in combination with the just 5ths and 4ths from the square wave modulation of the delays’ clock rates, I can almost reach some of the areas of just intonation electronic solo performance that I loved so much on Terry Riley’s just-intoned organ works like “Shri Camel” and “Persian Surgery Dervishes.”\\nWhat are your latest projects?\\nI’ve always been fairly prolific; I think I have been on about 250 or so albums at this point, since I was first on Eugene Chadbourne’s Guitar Trios album, back in 1976. For the most of the past three years, I had a mom painfully dying in hospice. The nearly full-time job of dealing with that slowed recording down quite a bit during that period for me—probably only three or four albums a year. I hope I am not overreacting too much with over productivity, now that I am back to working full-time again, but there are a myriad of projects suddenly happening for me.\\nI recorded with the great Afro-American trumpet-player and composer Wadada Leo Smith. Wadada and I made three double-CDs 10 or 12 years ago with our Yo Miles! project, which explored the electric music of Miles Davis in his most experimental period, from 1972 through 1975. This new recording was a kind of return for us to those textures and sounds. Wadada came up with some wonderful compositions for a one-off band, with Bill Laswell on bass, Pheeroan Aklaff on drums, and three guitarists: me, Michael Gregory, Brandon Ross. We probably won’t see this issued for a while as the Tum label has two or three other Wadada recordings lined up for release first. It was a great session though, and we really got all three guitars to work well, playing together at the same time. Those two guys are super-terrific players and it was a great pleasure to be in the studio with them.\\nIn a few weeks I’ll be in the studio with the amazing Ray Russell and a big band with two drummers, two basses, and four sax players. We are going to return to the musical areas of Ray’s more experimental stuff from the early ’70’s. Ray is someone who is totally amazing in many different senses for the wide range of things that he has done.\\nWorking on a couple of new solo guitar albums: The Deep Unreal, another 80 minute trance guitar solo, similar to my Everything Forever , and a solo album using a lot of different 12-string guitars, both acoustic and electric.\\nWeasel Walter, Damon Smith and I have another Plane Crash Trio album in the pipeline.\\nLooping brothers Bill and Rick Walker are talking about a trio album with the three of us.\\nA few months ago I made three albums in Houston in one day: an acoustic duet with the great guitarist Sandy Ewen, a duet with my old pal and bassist Damon Smith, as well as a quartet of the three of us along with Houston guitarist Ryan Edwards.\\nA project with Peter Brotzmann and I with a Danish band called Elektro seems to be up for recording in Denmark in July.\\nJonas Hellborg and I have been starting to plan a quartet band recording.\\nTrey Gunn, and Morgan Agren and I are talking about expanding our Invisible Rays trio to a quartet, with the addition of Matte Henderson and recording in Sweden sometime in the not too distant future.\\nThis stuff should keep me fairly busy for the next 12 months.',\n",

       " 'Introduction to Plastering Tools\\nPlastering is a skilled trade that requires precision, attention to detail, and the right tools to achieve a high-quality finish.\\nWith a wide variety of tools available for different plastering tasks, it’s essential to know which ones are best suited for your specific project.\\nThis ultimate guide to plastering tools will help you understand the purpose and usage of each tool, ensuring that you’re well-equipped for a successful plastering job.\\nChapter One – Plastering Trowels\\nOne of the most essential tools in any plasterer’s toolkit is the trowel.\\nTrowels come in various types, including finishing trowels, skimming trowels, and more, each designed for a specific purpose in the plastering process.\\n- Finishing trowels: These trowels are used for smoothing and finishing the plaster surface, providing a professional and polished look. They typically have a flat, rectangular blade made of stainless steel or carbon steel and a comfortable handle for easy use.\\n- Skimming trowels: Skimming trowels are designed for applying a thin layer of finishing plaster on top of a base coat, creating a smooth surface. They often feature a pre-worn blade to help achieve an even finish.\\n- Bucket trowels: This small, flat trowel is useful for getting plaster and compound out of the bucket and onto the hawk or mortar stand.\\nWhen selecting a trowel, consider factors such as blade size and shape, handle type, and material.\\nA larger blade can cover more surface area, making the job faster, while a smaller blade offers greater control for detailed work.\\nAdditionally, choose a trowel with an ergonomic handle for comfortable use during extended periods.\\nProper trowel maintenance is crucial for ensuring longevity and optimal performance.\\nClean your trowel after each use, removing any leftover plaster to prevent buildup.\\nOccasionally check for signs of wear and replace the trowel if necessary.\\nChapter Two – Hawk and Float\\nThe hawk and float are essential tools for holding and applying plaster during the plastering process.\\nA hawk is a flat, square platform with a central handle underneath, used to hold plaster while you work.\\nA float, on the other hand, is a smaller trowel-like tool used in conjunction with the hawk to apply and smooth plaster.\\nWhen choosing a hawk, look for one made of durable materials like aluminium or magnesium, with a comfortable handle that provides a secure grip.\\nThe size of the hawk should match your hand size and the amount of plaster you’ll typically be working with.\\nTo use a hawk and float effectively, practice scooping plaster onto the hawk with the float, then applying the plaster to the wall with smooth, controlled motions.\\nChapter Three – Mixing Tools\\nProperly mixing plaster is crucial for achieving a smooth, even finish.\\nThere are several tools available for mixing plaster, including mixing drills and paddle attachments.\\n- Mixing drills: These are power tools designed for mixing various materials, including plaster. When selecting a mixing drill, consider factors such as power, speed settings, and overall durability. A higher wattage drill will provide more power for mixing thicker materials, while variable speed settings allow for greater control during the mixing process.\\n- Paddle attachments: Paddle attachments, also known as mixing paddles, are used in conjunction with a mixing drill. These attachments come in various shapes and sizes, each designed for specific mixing tasks. A helical or spiral-shaped paddle is ideal for mixing plaster, as it promotes a smooth and consistent mix.\\nTo properly mix plaster, add the dry plaster to a clean mixing bucket, then gradually add water while operating the mixing drill with a paddle attachment.\\nBe sure to mix the plaster thoroughly, eliminating any lumps or inconsistencies, and achieve the desired consistency based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.\\nChapter Four – Straight Edges and Feather Edges\\nAchieving a flat, even surface is essential for professional plastering results. Straight edges and feather edges are tools designed to help plasterers accomplish this goal.\\n- Straight edges: These are long, straight metal or aluminium tools used to check and correct the flatness of a plastered surface. To use a straight edge, place it against the surface and look for any gaps or high spots, then adjust the plaster as needed.\\n- Feather edges: Feather edges are similar to straight edges, but they have a thinner profile and are typically more flexible. This flexibility allows for easier use on curved surfaces or in tight spaces.\\nWhen using these tools, work methodically across the surface, checking and correcting the flatness as you go.\\nThis process helps ensure a smooth, even finish that will look professional and stand the test of time.\\nChapter Five – Corner Plastering Tools\\nAchieving clean, sharp corners is an essential part of plastering, and specialised corner tools can help you accomplish this with ease.\\nSome of the most common corner tools include:\\n- Angle trowels: These trowels feature a blade with a 90-degree angle, designed for finishing internal corners. The angled blade allows for smooth application and shaping of plaster in tight spaces, ensuring a clean, professional finish.\\n- Corner floats: Corner floats, sometimes called corner sponges, are used to smooth and shape external corners after plastering. These tools consist of a sponge or foam material with a 90-degree angle, allowing you to work the plaster into a clean, sharp edge.\\nWhen working with corners, be sure to use the appropriate tool for the specific task, and take the time to ensure a precise, professional finish.\\nChapter Six – Plastering Stilts and Hop Ups\\nFor larger plastering projects or working on ceilings, plasterers often require additional height to reach their work area comfortably.\\nPlastering stilts and hop ups can provide the necessary elevation, allowing you to work more efficiently and safely.\\n- Plastering stilts: These adjustable stilts strap to your legs and feet, allowing you to walk and work at an elevated height. Stilts offer flexibility and mobility while working on high surfaces, but they require practice and skill to use safely.\\n- Hop ups or ladders: Alternatively, you can use a sturdy hop up or a ladder to reach higher areas. While these options provide a stable platform for working, they may not offer the same level of mobility as stilts.\\nWhichever option you choose, always prioritise safety when working at height, using appropriate fall protection measures and ensuring that your equipment is in good condition.\\nChapter Seven – Cleaning and Maintenance Tools\\nProper cleaning and maintenance of your plastering tools are essential for extending their lifespan and ensuring optimal performance.\\nSome essential cleaning tools include:\\n- Plasterer’s brush: A soft-bristle brush is perfect for cleaning your trowels and other tools after use. The soft bristles help remove plaster without damaging the tools.\\n- Cleaning water and sponge: Keep a bucket of clean water and a sponge nearby while working to wipe down your tools as needed. Regular cleaning prevents plaster buildup, which can affect the performance of your tools.\\nAfter each plastering job, clean your tools thoroughly, removing all traces of plaster, and store them in a dry, protected location.\\nBy understanding the purpose and usage of each plastering tool, you’ll be well-equipped to tackle any plastering project with confidence.\\nWith the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a professional, high-quality finish that will stand the test of time.\\nThis exploration of plastering tools has offered an in-depth view of the essential instruments used in the plastering trade, from the basic hand tools to specialised equipment.\\nThe discussion began with the ubiquitous plastering trowel, the plasterer’s primary tool. Used for applying, spreading, and smoothing plaster, the trowel is a versatile instrument available in different shapes and sizes to accommodate various tasks and preferences.\\nNext, the focus shifted to the hawk and float. The hawk, a flat platform for holding plaster, and the float, used for smoothing and levelling the plaster, form a crucial partnership in the plastering process.\\nThe importance of proper mixing was underscored in the section about mixing tools, which are essential for creating a smooth, workable plaster mix. Mechanical mixers and sturdy buckets, as well as mixing paddles for drill attachments, were identified as key tools for this stage.\\nThen, attention turned to straight edges and feather edges. These tools ensure a flat and level finish to the plaster, vital for achieving a professional-looking result.\\nCorner tools were introduced next. These specialised tools help create clean, sharp corners and edges, enhancing the finish and durability of the plasterwork.\\nThe guide also ventured into the realm of plastering stilts and hop ups, essential for reaching high areas. While these may not be necessary for every project, they can increase efficiency and comfort for extensive or high-reaching plastering work.\\nFinally, the importance of tool maintenance was emphasised with a discussion on cleaning tools. Keeping tools clean and in good working order not only extends their lifespan but also ensures the best possible finish to plasterwork.\\nIn sum, a well-equipped plasterer’s toolkit should feature a range of trowels, a hawk and float, mixing tools, straight and feather edges, corner tools, and potentially stilts or hop ups.\\nAdditionally, proper cleaning and maintenance tools are critical for ensuring the longevity and effectiveness of this equipment. Understanding these tools, their use, and care is vital for anyone engaged in plastering, whether as a DIY enthusiast or a professional.',\n",
       " \"Partisan wrangling likely to block January 6 commission in Congress\\nGet insights on the latest news in US politics from Jon Lieber, head of Eurasia Group's coverage of political and policy developments in Washington:\\nWhat is the status of the proposed January 6 commission to investigate the Capitol assault?\\nThe January 6 commission was an idea originally from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who proposed a commission modeled after the very successful 9/11 commission, which looked at intelligence failures leading up to the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in Manhattan on September 11th, 2001. Pelosi wanted to form a bipartisan commission to look at the Capitol insurrection on January 6th. Why it happened, how it happened, what the security failures were that led to it happening, who's responsible, and how to prevent it from ever happening again? And initially, Republicans were fairly cold to this idea because Pelosi had proposed a commission that was stacked in favor of the Democrats, with more democratic members than Republicans. House Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, empowered representative John Katko from New York to go ahead and negotiate the commission. And eventually he came up with a compromised proposal that would have been evenly balanced between Republicans and Democrats, had subpoena power, and been able to produce a report by the end of the year.\\nRepublicans, however, decided in the meantime that this commission was not good news for them. They began to be concerned that the Democrats would use this as a partisan opportunity to link them to the insurgence that took over the Capitol building, who were largely both in favor of Donald Trump, and also inspired by him to go and charge the Capitol. And the Republicans just don't want to be talking about this anymore. They want to move on and talk about Biden's policy agenda, where they think they're on much more stable political ground.\\nMcCarthy now opposes the commission, which passed the House this week with about 35 Republican members voting for it, members who thought they were operating in good faith and typically want to be part of the problem solvers group in the House of Representatives. But it's unlikely to go anywhere in the Senate because minority leader McConnell opposes the commission, and probably represents the views of enough Republicans to successfully filibuster this thing.\\nSo this isn't going to go anywhere. There may be congressional investigations into what happened on January 6th, but those investigations in the grand tradition of the hearings into Benghazi, and other purely partisan issues are going to be led by Democrats with Republicans. Maybe they participate, maybe they don't, but this is turning into a very partisan issue, as many other issues are in the US today.\",\n",

Supported by Unicef, the center allows to accommodate, feed and provide education for all young people in search of landmarks. While the center is trying to find their parents, boys do not remain inactive. Together, they form \"Cœur à Cœur\" (Heart to Heart) a group of hip-hop dynamics and motivated. One of their songs is called \"Nous prenons nos propres décisions\" (We take our own decisions) which reveals how these young people want to take control of their future.

       " 'This property was perfect for our family of 4. Our boys loved playing on the beach and riding the waves all day with the provided boogie boards. The view is unmatched and the large doors opening up to the lanai was perfect for listening to the waves. The beach was never crowded and the waves were great for letting our kids play. We absolutely loved this property and will definitely be back! We watched the beautiful Maui sunset every night from the quiet and peaceful lanai. Thank you for sharing this beautiful property with us.\\nIt was our first trip to Hawaii and naturally we wanted all to be perfect. Thanks to this amazing condo and location it was! Our family of four was overwhelmed by the view. The ocean and mountains were spectacular. The beach was private and quiet ... with perfect sand for our morning and evening strolls along the Pacific.\\nThe snorkeling and turtle viewing was the real deal as we saw turtles each and every time we snorkeled. The condo is supplied with all the amenities a family would desire ... beach chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards, etc. Also no need to sweat the small stuff as the owners Mark & Cory along with Maria the property manager have all your needs covered (laundry detergent, bathroom necessities, cleaning supplies, paper towel, napkins, fully stocked kitchen, etc.). We were also surprised by the welcoming gift basket we found when we checked in! This unit deserves the Five star rating it perpetually receives!!\\nThank you Mark, Cory, and Maria for the family vacation of a lifetime.\\nThe Schmit family (June, 2023)\\nThis was by far the best VRBO we stayed at in all of our years traveling to Hawaii. It is steps from a very soft sandy beach. The location is very quiet away from the crowds. The kitchen is very well furnished with all the kitchen utensils you need. The view out to the ocean from the lanai is outstanding. We had several dinners out on the lanai. Highly highly recommended!\\nMy family and I had an excellent time at Makena Surf! The location is unbeatable: with the best view!! (think: perfect morning coffees on the lanai, beautiful sunsets every night, hearing the ocean waves from our beds); easy access to the great beach (which was not crowded, has perfect waves for kids to play/boogie board and great snorkeling); and close to stores/shopping if desired. The unit is exactly as presented, and it the best stocked kitchen we have ever had, which was a real treat! We actually cancelled our one dinner reservation because you couldn\\'t beat watching the sunset on our own lanai! The complex also has two great big pools that my kids really enjoyed swimming in. The owner and property manager were both fantastic. This is our new favourite spot on Maui, and I hope to be back soon. Highly recommend!\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful Maui condo! Everything was perfect and exactly as advertised! The sunsets were out of this world and the patio was a perfect place to enjoy them! So much so, that we rarely left for dinner! Our kids really enjoyed the beach - the snorkeling was amazing and the surf was perfect for boogie boarding. So rare to find both on the same beach! The condo had everything we expected, and more! Our stay was incredibly relaxing and we are already looking forward to our next visit! Mahalo to Maria and the fabulous owners of B-303!\\nWonderful property, everything with ideal. Excellent communications\\nCondo was exactly as presented. You can not go wrong staying here.\\nWe had a great time in Makena Surf B-303! Is was very clean, beautiful, comfortable…just amazing. We ate out on the lanai everyday, enjoying the beautiful view. The house was fully stocked with everything we could possibly need…from beach things to laundry soap and even special Maui snacks. We hope to stay again very soon.\\nProperty is amazing! View is breathtaking.\\nThank you Mark and Cory for sharing this special place! Our Family had a wonderful time and plan on coming back as soon as possible!\\nThank you Maria for a seamless check in and welcome basket!\\nThe property was amazing. The photos of the unit, while very accurate, don\\'t do it justice. Mark & Cory (host) have a great place and were exceptional in timely responses to any questions. Maria (property/VRBO manager) was great too.\\nThe unit had EVERYTHING we needed and then some (e.g., nice touch having the phone chargers on the nightstands in the master bedroom).\\nThe sunsets from the back porch of the unit and beach were fantastic. My family took photos on a grassy section of the Makena Surf property (about a 2-3 min walk from the unit) and it was easily one of the prettiest views I\\'d ever seen.\\nWe are a family of 4 with two teens. We love having a resort location/vibe AND having the space to move around in a unit. If you are looking for something in the SW section Maui in the Makena/Wailea area, I\\'d highly recommend this unit. We easily had a 5-star experience. We visited one of the nearby exclusive resorts with a resort pass and my wife and I looked at each other and said we clearly made the right decision staying where we did.\\nMahola to Mark, Cory & Maria.\\nOur stay at Makena Surf B303 on Maui was amazing. It exceeded all expectations. Mark and Corey\\'s home was cozy, comfortable and beautifully decorated. It made a perfect location to go out and explore the island. And it was the perfect location to just \"be at home on the lanai\" - whale watch, listen to the surf, watch the sunset and sip champagne. The property manager, Maria, checked in both on arrival and departure and was available should any assistance be needed. Thank you Mark and Corey for sharing your home with us - it truly was a week spent in paradise. Warmest Mahalo! Amy and Burt\\nWe enjoyed our stay tremendously. The property owner and condo manager were friendly and responsive. We highly recommend this place.\\nThe unit was wonderfully accessorized and immaculate. It is a prime location with outstanding beach access and views. Enjoyed watching the whales, swimmers, and walkers. Owners and property manager are very responsive.\\nA glorious property. Fantastic location and outstanding view from the spacious lanai. Well appointed kitchen. Mark and Maria checked in to ensure all was well with our stay. Magical Christmas in Maui our family of four will always remember. Highly recommend Makena Surf and hope to be back someday!!!\\nGreat location, immaculate grounds, large beachfront patio, and responsive owner and staff.\\nWe have stayed at the Makena Surf many times but B-303 is the most well-stocked and most welcoming condo we’ve ever stayed in. From the very helpful, friendly and professional manager to the array of kitchen and beach items available, this condo is a “dream come true”. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Makena Surf.\\nEverything about this property was great. It was perfect for my husband and I alone but see that is would be a wonderful place for families as well. We will definitely be back.\\nI am a hotel girl…but after staying at this property, I don’t know how I can go back to a hotel! The communication with Mark the owner was fantastic even before we arrived. When we arrived, Maria the manager made herself available to us the entire time. Ok, now with that out of the way, the condo had the most spectacular view with the most wonderful lanai. We cooked our BBQ dinners overlooking the incredible Maui sunset every night. The condo had every single thing we could have needed. We cannot wait to return. Thank you, Mark, Cory and Maria!\\nFor those looking to enjoy a quiet Maui beach with sunset views, look no further. Makena Surf is a serene complex on a lovely sandy beach. If you like snorkeling, Turtle Town is about a 100 yard swim from this beach; tons of turtles and fish, pretty coral. The beach is fairly uncrowded, especially Monday through Thursday. A few hundred yards down the beach is a state park where you see folks getting married on the beach literally every night (presumably because a photographer told them this beach was quiet and perfect at sunset).\\nAny condo in this complex would be good, but B303 seems really perfect. It’s been recently redecorated in a modern, tasteful vibe. Listening to the surf crashing on the waves for morning coffee never gets old. There are thoughtful touches in this condo ... plenty of spices, beach chairs and umbrellas, and a box filled with anything you might possibly need on the beach.\\nLastly, the owners and house manager Maria are super responsive and helpful. Maria had great recommendations on take out food options. In short, all the 5 star reviews are well-earned. We are already contemplating when we return.',\n",

       " 'Fashion presenter and Instagram star Naomi Isted never knew when her IBS symptoms would cripple her with bloating and cramps – here’s how she finally got it under control\\nNaomi Isted has nearly 80,000 Instagram followers and a staggering 225,000 on Twitter. Though the 38 year old mother of two is based in London, she often travels the world covering fashion and lifestyle trends for the likes of Good Morning Britain and the E! News network. But behind the successful, super-glamourous image, the TV presenter and celebrity stylist has suffered with chronic, debilitating Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) since she was 16 years old, never quite knowing when the bloating, severe cramps and stomach pains would strike next.\\nIBS is a vicious cycle that few understand unless they have the condition, says Isted, who is now 38 and lives in Essex with her husband and two children. For her, this cycle was dramatically compounded by her busy, frenetic work lifestyle. ‘I remember in my 20s travelling around the world filming a wine programme and literally always being in pain. It would debilitate me and then make me feel so tired and worn out, and that would have a knock-on effect on my work, my sleep and my mood the next day. Then, I would get more and more anxious about it, thinking: ‘Am I going to be able to find the right places to eat, where will I find healthy food while we’re on tour?’ and the resulting anxiety would make the IBS worse’.\\nThe agony of IBS\\nIsted was covering London Fashion Week last month and the impact on her IBS couldn’t be denied. ‘It’s fine when I am at home because by now I know the things that set me off – processed carbs such as gluten containing breads, even rice as well as milk and cheese. But when I am waking up at 5am to cover the shows, I know I need to eat right but where am I going to get my hands on some salmon and vegetables (which I know won’t bloat me) in the middle of LFW? Will there be things for me to eat? As a result, I’d end up panicking which would make the whole thing worse because there is such a link between IBS and anxiety. Sometimes would simply avoid eating altogether until it was really late and I was at home because I didn’t want to be sitting on the front row in agony the next day.’\\nIBS is thought to affect up to one in five people at some point in their life, according to the NHS. It usually first develops when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age with around twice as many women are affected as men. The condition is often lifelong, although it may improve over several years. Unfortunately, many doctors are confounded by it, often issuing medications that treat only the symptoms, which usually include like Naomi’s, extreme abdominal cramps and bloating, as well as diarrhoea and constipation.\\nThe medications that stopped working\\nDiagnosed by her doctor at 16, Naomi’s IBS manifested primarily as extreme cramps and bloating and resulted in her being prescribed various medications over the years. ‘All my medications have been medical derivatives of mint that would help settle my stomach. But nothing worked for long,’ she says. ‘I think my body always became immune to every medication I was put on so eventually, nothing was terribly effective.’\\nI am a size 8 but if I am bloated my waist size can increase by two inches\\nUntil recently, IBS posed such an occupational hazard for Isted that she was often sent clothes by designers that she would have otherwise fitted into perfectly, if not for her boated stomach which Isted estimates could make her waist girth expand by a staggering two inches. ‘I am a size eight and designers would send me outfits to wear to specific events such as LFW,’ she says. ‘ But while my whole body is slim, if I am bloated I won’t be able to get into it because I will look like I am three months pregnant. I can’t tell you what that does for your self-confidence when you are surrounded by models that are towering over you and all size zero.’\\nHaving always stuck to her various medications, and finding nothing really worked anymore, Isted began to research other IBS remedies online. About a month before this year’s London Fashion Week, she discovered Alflorex, a probiotic that is specifically formulated for those suffering with IBS. ‘I had never really considered the idea that IBS could be related to the bacteria in your gut, but I was prepared to give anything a go. I liked the fact that it was a simple one-a-day pill and also that it seemed to come with good medical research,’ Isted remembers.\\nProbiotics are supplements that help replenish healthy bacteria in the gut which can be diminished by a stressful lifestyle, high sugar diet or taking antibiotics. A dearth of good bacteria in the digestive system have been shown to lead to problems as wide-ranging as eczema, depression and obesity and they are well-proven as a leading cause of bloating and IBS. The specific probiotic Isted tried was Alflorex, which contains a specific strain (35624) of bacteria shown in clinical trials as effective against the symptoms of IBS such as bloating, tummy pain and alternating bouts of diarrhoea and constipation in as little as four weeks. It was developed by scientists at the University of Cork and is recommended widely by gastroenterologists.\\nThe probiotic supplement that helped\\n‘I was ready to try anything and thought that in order to give it the best chance of working, I would stop my medication and see what happened,’ says Isted. Though Alflorex is supposed to take up to four weeks to work, for Isted the difference became noticeable more quickly. ‘Within about three days I noticed I wasn’t getting the stomach cramps I used to get and I was thinking, ‘Oh, it’s probably in my head,’ but about ten days later I noticed my stomach wasn’t getting bloated.’ Then, even her husband noted the difference. ‘In the evening my belly could get really bloated ordinarily, so I would use all the tricks; wear clothes that were loose around my stomach, cover up and so on. But at home I was always really relaxed so I guess it showed more. Just over a week after I started taking the Alflorex, my husband said ‘Wow! Your stomach’s looking really flat!’ which was nice.’\\nbeing able to carry on through your day and not feel cramping, tummy pain or bloating, feels nothing short of a miracle\\nConsequently, this year’s London Fashion Week was a different experience for Isted from years gone by. ‘I was able to fit into all the clothes I was sent,’ she remembers. ‘But it wasn’t just about fitting into clothes, it’s also what having a flat stomach has done for my confidence. I know it sounds stupid but after you have had two children and having spent what feels like a lifetime waking up feeling bloated, to suddenly be waking up with a flat stomach and being able to carry on through your day and not feel cramping or more tummy pain or bloating, feels nothing short of a miracle.’\\nNow, though Isted’s busy lifestyle hasn’t changed, the panic and anxiety and terrible symptoms IBS used to cause her has. ‘Of course, I still take care with what I am eating – avoiding gluten and dairy and processed carbs where I can – but now during times when I am always travelling and having to eat with film crews whatever is available or if it’s half term and I am out with the children and there’s no healthy food in a play area I can get, I don’t have to panic because I can have a little not-so-healthy food and my stomach won’t react the way it used to. That’s meant the anxiety about my IBS has lessened and as a result, I have had a reprieve from that horrible vicious cycle of bloat-panic-can’t-find-healthy-food-panic-eat-whatever-I-can-find-bloat-again. Relief from the huge stress of that has been the biggest confidence booster’.\\nEating for IBS: Naomi Isted’s diet\\nIt’s taken years of trial and error but Naomi Isted has finally discovered that certain foods can worsen her IBS. Having said that, there is now nothing she avoids eating altogether, only foods she eats less and those she eats more of. ‘In the past I tried to eradicate everything that bloated me but that only meant that if I ended up in a situation where I had to eat some bread or pasta, the effect on my IBS was ten times worse,’ she explains. ‘Now, I eat the things that don’t bother me in unlimited quantities and have a very little of others that bloat me and – along with taking the Alflorex daily – I seem to have finally got this thing under control.’\\nEats little or never…\\nPasta (I love it so much I actually do eat pasta once a week, though it rarely agrees with me), rice, white bread\\nDairy products such as milk and most cheeses\\nProsecco, Champagne or anything with bubbles\\nAnything containing gluten\\nSalmon and other fish\\nVegetables and salad\\nApples, bananas, berries\\nChocolate (in small amounts!)\\nEXPLAINER: HOW ALFLOREX WORKS\\nAlflorex, is the result of more than 17 years of clinical research and 75 leading scientific publications. Probiotics contains special bacteria, and different bacteria in the gut have different functions in the body. Alflorex contain contains a probiotic strain called B. infantis3564 which specifically targets and alleviates the symptoms of IBS, such as bloating, tummy pain and unpredictable diarrhoea and constipation. Only recently launched in the UK, the strain is known in the US as Align, where it is the number one probiotic recommended by gastroenterologists for the treatment of the symptoms of IBS. ‘The gut bacteria plays an important role in many digestive health issues,’ says Professor Eammon Quigley, one of the world’s leading Gastroenterologists in IBS and Chief of Gastroenterology at Houston Methodist Hospital. ‘B. infantis 35624, the strain in Alflorex, is one of the few products that has been truly developed on a scientific basis and tested in high quality clinical studies to help the symptoms of IBS.’\\nHealthista readers can receive 20% off the marked price.

       " 'In Knoxville, TN, our clinic treats many different skin conditions that can affect different parts of the body. Among the conditions we adeptly manage are keloids, warts, cancer, and psoriasis.\\nOur doctors work with primary care providers to treat skin cancer using advanced methods. One of these methods is low-energy x-ray therapy. This treatment is particularly effective for squamous cell carcinoma and allows for quick treatment.\\nKeloids, particularly arising from piercings, receive meticulous attention with advanced techniques emphasizing minimal scarring.\\nFor psoriasis, affecting different body areas, our personalized treatment plans emphasize symptom relief and overall skin health improvement.\\nWe effectively treat different types of warts on the body, including common and plantar warts. Explore below for detailed insights into our approach to these diverse skin conditions.\\nA wart is a small, non-cancerous growth on the skin caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts are generally harmless and can appear on various parts of the body including hands and feet.\\nHPV is very sensitive to x-ray therapy. We are able to break down the tissues containing the viral disease. At Heelex, we treat stubborn warts that have not responded well to over the counter topical medications, cryotherapy, or laser therapy. As we kill away the warty tissue, we leave room for new, healthy skin and tissue to grow in place of where your wart had affected the skin. You may experience some redness and skin dryness with this treatment, but this always heals normally and will only last a short amount of time.\\nPsoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by the rapid and abnormal growth of skin cells, leading to the formation of thick, red patches covered with silvery scales. This immune-mediated disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells, causing an accelerated turnover of skin cells. Psoriasis commonly manifests on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back, but it can affect any part of the body.\\nThe condition is often associated with itching, pain, and inflammation. Psoriasis is not contagious, and while its exact cause is not fully understood, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment approaches vary and may include topical creams and oral medications.\\nWe use superficial x-rays to target the affected area of the skin. The low-dose of x-rays helps to slow down the growth of skin cells and reduce inflammation of the skin caused by psoriasis.\\n“I had suffered for 24 YEARS with pustular psoriasis on my foot. I tried everything and nothing worked out–only worked for a short time. After going to Heelex for treatment my foot has been clear for 2 years!!! Heelex changed my life. Thank you to Heelex and their amazing staff!”\\nNon-Melanoma Skin Cancer\\nSuperficial X-rays, also known as low-energy X-rays, are utilized in the treatment of certain types of skin cancer. This is particularly effective for treating superficial or localized skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Superficial X-rays are designed to penetrate only a limited depth of tissue, making them suitable for targeting cancer cells near the surface of the skin while minimizing damage to deeper tissues. This targeted approach helps to destroy cancer cells and prevent them from proliferating. Dermatologists and radiation oncologists often consider superficial X-ray therapy as a non-invasive and well-tolerated option for specific skin cancer cases, particularly in instances where surgery may not be optimal or for patients who are not candidates for other treatments.\\n“I highly recommend Heelex for treatment of pain related to arthritis. I am a diabetic and I chose Heelex to treat a benign basal cell carcinoma. The treatment was painless and healed completely without any visible change in my skin. Absolutely thrilled with the result.”\\nKeloids are raised overgrowths of scar tissue that can develop after an injury or surgery. Superficial X-ray therapy is utilized to target the abnormal cells in the keloid tissue, slowing down their growth and promoting a more controlled healing response. By delivering focused x-rays to the keloid site, this treatment aims to reduce the size and thickness of the keloid, leading to improved cosmetic appearance and relief from symptoms such as itching or tenderness. Superficial X-ray therapy for keloids is often considered when other treatments, such as corticosteroid injections or surgical removal, have not been successful or are not suitable for a particular patient.',\n",
       " \"How Cables Are Made - Step 6: Jacket Extrusion\\nWhen producing cables and wires, every little detail counts. In the sixth part of our series, you will learn how the jacket is manufactured and why it is important.\\nMulti-conductor cables - whether with or without braiding - require a jacket. This is what makes a cable complete, as it holds together its various components such as the conductors, braiding and filling materials. However, this is not the jacket’s one and only purpose. Jacketing also protects cables from mechanical stresses such as bending and torsion and makes them resistant to heat, cold, fire, chemicals, water or oil.\\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of every application, the right jacketing material must be selected. The range of materials available is wide: in its production facilities, HELUKABEL works with more than 80 different plastics. The most common ones are:\\n- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): Often selected for its low cost and overall resistance to chemicals. However, its mechanical resilience is limited, and it is not always oil resistant.\\n- Polyurethane (PUR): High-quality plastic resistant to abrasion, oil and chemicals, suitable for dynamic applications.\\n- Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE): Resistant plastics suitable for high mechanical loads and for use in damp and wet rooms.\\nThe wall thickness of the jacket can be between 0.2 and 5 millimeters, but most commonly, it is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimeters. HELUKABEL's thinnest jacketed cables have a diameter of just 2.4 millimeters, while the thickest ones reach a remarkable 78 millimeters in diameter.\\nSimilarly to the conductor insulation process, the jacket is applied with an extruder. This consists of a metering unit for the plastic granulate, a screw that transports and heats the material, and a cylinder with a spray head that applies the viscous plastic uniformly to the passing cable. Afterwards, the cable runs through a water bath where the jacket cools down and hardens. The jacketed cable is tested with laser cameras and high-voltage testers and finally coiled before it reaches the final step in production: labeling.\\nAsk the expert\\nMr Sefuenc, what is the difference between the conductor insulation and the jacket?\\nIt’s very simple: The conductor insulation has the task of galvanically separating the individual elements in multi-conductor cables. It is therefore applied to each conductor individually and influences the electrical properties of a cable such as the dielectric strength. The jacket, however, protects the inner parts of a cable from harmful environmental impacts as well as from mechanical stress. It has no electrical function. The manufacturing process, though, is the same: both involve a thin layer of plastic that is applied with an extruder.\\nWhat factors must be considered during the jacket extrusion process?\\nThere are many parameters that have to be considered: for example, the diameter of the cable itself. The thicker the cable, the stronger the jacket must be to withstand all loads. Moreover, the wall thickness must be as uniform and concentric as possible to ensure harmonious functioning and machine processability of the cable, for example when stripping.\\nHow do cables actually get their individual color?\\nThe color concentrate in the desired shade is added to the plastic granulate in the extruder's dosage unit. In the screw, under the impact of heat, a homogeneous and viscous mass is formed, which is similar to honey. This is applied using a spray head so that the cable comes out of the machine in the color ordered by the customer. Almost all imaginable RAL shades are possible. For some materials, special color batches have to be produced.\",\n",

The best brewers make large yeast starters to get their beer fermenting fast, and most of them do so in an Erlenmeyer flask. Large populations of active yeast help ensure flavorful beer free of off flavors. Because this flask is made from borosilicate glass you can move it from a boil into a cold water bath for cooling. This means you can do the whole process in one container, keeping it simple and helping to reduce the risk of contamination when transferring from one container to another.\\nDouble Boiler Method\\nIt is important for your safety to heat water in the flask with a heat source that distributes heat evenly. Morebeer! recommends using the “double boiler method.” This process involves using a boiling water bath on the outside of the flask to heat up the water inside the flask. All you need is a kettle 3 gallons or larger. This process is much safer and efficient. If the flask should break or boil over, your kettle will be there to collect the contents, thus keeping your stove clean and keeping you safe.\\nSafety First: Please take us up on a great deal – save $14.95 when you purchase a 5000ml flask and our BE300 5 gallon stainless steel kettle at the same time. Use Promo code SAFETY1 at checkout.\\n- Massive 5L (5000ML) Capacity\\n- Made from Borosilicate Glass (also known as Pyrex)\\n- Fantastic price for a flask of this size\\n- Produced for MoreBeer!\\nWhy make a yeast starter? (from our FAQ)\\nWe build starters for 3 main reasons. First, to ensure yeast health. By making a starter 1-3 days in advance, you ensure that your yeast is healthy and strong and ready to do its job. Second, to create more yeast. By making the starter you will increase the cell count of the yeast, giving you a better chance of keeping bacteria’s and wild yeasts from fermenting your wort. Third, if you are making high gravity beers. If you are making a high gravity beer (1.060+) you will need more yeast to start the ferment faster. High gravity beers will also finish more completely when you pitch ample quantities of yeast.\\nLimited Availability Deal of the Day: As of this posting, this is marked down to $31.99 as a MoreBeer Deal of the Day.

Perhaps you do not have a lot of backyard space, or any at all. But to be a extremely successful vegetable gardener — and to do it organically — you may want to grasp what it takes to maintain your crops wholesome and vigorous. Whereas the thought of growing fruit and vegetables in your individual backyard would possibly sound relatively taxing, the benefits that come along with it are extraordinarily value it. Right here to convince you is 5 advantages of yard gardening.\\nLikelihood is you already have many of these components: food, water and shelter in the backyard (together with one or more native vegetation to your space) and earth-friendly gardening practices in maintaining it. The first way to maximize space within the garden is to convert from conventional row planting to three- or 4-foot-broad raised beds. Vegetable gardening may be very primitive, however but somehow refined.\\nIf the soil in your yard has by no means been gardened, chances are high your vegetables will do nicely within the first 12 months. You possibly can even interplant crops that develop quickly (radishes) alongside other greens that require a long season (carrots or parsnips), sowing their seeds collectively. Glacial rock dust is particularly valuable as a soil amendment, especially after the first year of gardening has absorbed accessible minerals and nutrients.\\nPlanting crops in succession is yet one more strategy to maximize rising space within the garden. While suburbs with correct gardens, and timber, are cooler than densely packed fence-to-fence developments with barely any space between properties. Garden soil must be nicely aerated to promote root development and worm activity. Give your backyard or front lawn a fresh look this season with these gorgeous garden design ideas.',\n",
       " 'BBQ Tips: Expert-Level Grilling Hacks\\nGrilling season is here, and it’s time to take your BBQ skills to the next level. Whether you’re a seasoned grill master or just starting out, these expert-level grilling hacks will help you impress your guests and elevate your BBQ game. So, fire up the grill and get ready to learn some BBQ tips that will make you the ultimate grill boss.\\n1. Preparing the Grill\\nBefore you start grilling, it’s essential to prepare your grill properly. Clean the grates thoroughly and remove any leftover debris from previous cookouts. This will ensure even heat distribution and prevent your food from sticking to the grates. Additionally, oiling the grates before cooking will help create those beautiful grill marks we all love.\\n2. Choosing the Right Cuts of Meat\\nTo achieve mouthwatering results, it’s crucial to select the right cuts of meat for grilling. Opt for well-marbled cuts like ribeye, T-bone, or New York strip steak for juicy and flavorful results. For chicken, go for bone-in, skin-on pieces to retain moisture and enhance the taste. Don’t forget to season your meat generously with your favorite rub or marinade for an extra burst of flavor.\\n3. Mastering the Art of Temperature Control\\nControlling the temperature is key to perfectly grilled food. Invest in a good quality meat thermometer to ensure your meat is cooked to perfection. Different meats require different internal temperatures for optimal doneness. For example, medium-rare steak should reach an internal temperature of 135°F (57°C), while chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Remember to let your meat rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\\n4. Adding Flavor with Smoke\\nOne of the secrets to achieving that authentic BBQ flavor is adding smoke to your grill. Experiment with different types of wood chips, such as hickory, mesquite, or applewood, to infuse your food with delicious smoky flavors. Soak the wood chips in water for about 30 minutes before adding them to the grill to create a steady stream of smoke.\\n5. Getting Creative with Grilled Vegetables\\nGrilling isn’t just for meat lovers. Take advantage of the grill’s high heat to cook a variety of vegetables and add a healthy and flavorful touch to your BBQ spread. Bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and corn on the cob are just a few examples of vegetables that grill beautifully. Brush them with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and grill until tender and slightly charred.\\n6. Don’t Forget the BBQ Sauce\\nNo BBQ is complete without a delicious BBQ sauce. Whether you prefer a tangy vinegar-based sauce or a sweet and smoky one, slathering your grilled meats with a flavorful sauce will take them to the next level. Experiment with homemade or store-bought sauces to find your favorite combination.\\nWith these expert-level grilling hacks, you’re well on your way to becoming a BBQ pro. Remember to prepare your grill, choose the right cuts of meat, master temperature control, add smoke for flavor, get creative with grilled vegetables, and don’t forget the BBQ sauce. So, gather your friends and family, and get ready to enjoy some mouthwatering BBQ dishes that will leave everyone asking for your secret grilling tips.

       " 'Many young people who have not started to work, have lots of free time because of their summer holidays, university vacation or the gap months between A-levels and the beginning of university, an apprenticeship or job in autumn. To live abroad for several weeks and get to know a different culture as well as improving language skills is a fantastic way of filling this gap.\\nBut spending time abroad is quite expensive as well. So if these young people are keen to get some experience abroad, they can often only afford to go for one or two weeks. That’s not enough to improve a language properly. But there is good news for everybody who wants to spend a few weeks in the summer abroad while improving language skills: The Summer Au Pair!\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat exactly is a Summer Au Pair?\\nA Summer Au Pair is usually a boy or a girl who is interested to spend the summer months in another country, looking after somebody’s children and helping with light household duties. Simply said: A Summer Au Pair is pretty much like a “normal” Au Pair but instead of staying – as usual – for 6 to 12 months, the Summer Au Pair only temporarily lives with the Host Family for a couple of weeks up to three months and typically over the summer.\\nThe Summer Au Pair gets also paid pocket money and should be given a private room too. It might even be possible that the Summer Au Pair is given the chance to go on holidays with the Host Family while staying for the summer, so there might be an extra adventure waiting for Summer Au Pairs.\\nWhy is a Host Family looking for an Au Pair only in the summer?\\nVery often, the parents have to work at least some weeks during the long summer holidays and are unable to look after their children when the school or nursery schools are closed. So, they need somebody to take care of the little ones while the they are at work.\\nDue to the fact that the children might be at home the whole day, the Summer Au Pair should be aware of the possibility, that he/she has to take care of the children several hours up to full time during a day (remember, schools are closed) and hence, attending language schools might be somehow more difficult than for a regular Au Pair which normally has time off during the day when the kids are in school or nursery. But a Summer Au Pair will also have some spare time and the weekends off. It is just good to know that a Summer Au Pair may end up having to look after the children really a lot.\\nWhat to take into consideration when applying for a Summer Au Pair?\\nPlease note, that you have the biggest chance to get hired as a Summer Au Pair when you can spend at least six or eight weeks abroad and the more flexible you are, the better. So students, prospective students waiting for the term to begin or pupils with long summer holidays (Germany, France, Ireland & UK, Spain etc.) can work as a Summer Au Pair in almost every country. Just keep in mind that most Host Families start looking for a summer Au Pair as early as April/May in order to have enough time to find a suitable Summer Au Pair.\\nUsually, Host Parents want to hire someone from July till September because it is the main holiday season and schools are closed. So, chances to find a Host Family for the summer are pretty good.\\nYou may also find families who look for a Summer Au Pair to start earlier, for example if their last Au Pair needs to leave before the summer for various reasons.\\nWhich are the most important things I need to check before starting the Summer Au Pair experience?\\nBefore you start to look for a Host Family for the summer months you should be sure about the answers of a few questions which we have listed below. Even though being a Summer Au Pair sounds like a fun and not a too exhausting thing, because it is a limited number of weeks and you will “somehow survive” even if it is more exhausting than expected, you should keep in mind, that the Host Family needs a reliable child care arrangement also over the summer months. Questions you may want to ask yourself include things like:\\n- Do I have enough time to stay between July and September? At least one month, most of the time it is easier to find a family for two to three months?\\n- Do I want to spend the summer somewhere else with a family I don’t know?\\n- Do I accept spending more time than usual Au Pairs with the children?\\n- Do I know how to entertain the children several hours?\\n- Do I accept going on holidays with somebody I do not know for long?\\n- Can I start my other duties after the summer without necessary having had a proper time to relax myself?\\nOf course, there are many other important things prospective Summer Au Pairs have to check before applying or moving to the new country. The check-list above only lists some important things Summer Au Pair need to consider.\\nIn case you have any question, do not hesitate to contact us. Remember: Being a Summer Au Pair is definitely a good choice if you want to spend the summer abroad but you do not have the money to travel. It might also be seen as a test run to check whether you are able to stay away from home for a longer period of time.',\n",

You can also apply mashed avocado mixed with honey and yogurt as a face mask to refresh dull skin or combine the avocado with olive oil as a deep conditioning hair mask.\\nBonus: use the inside of the peel to exfoliate dead skin on your face and body for a truly deep clean.\\nAnother staple to soothe sensitive skin (something many of us redheads deal with regularly) is oatmeal. Colloidal oatmeal (a finely ground form of oats) has a venerable history of use to treat skin ailments including rashes, eczema, sunburn, and dryness. To make it at home simply grind up uncooked rolled oats and combine with water to create a paste, applying to irritated areas of the body, rinsing off after about 10 minutes. Likewise, draw yourself a comforting oatmeal bath to soak in for a full body treatment.\\nKnown as an ancient food, the oldest surviving honey dates back to 5,500 years ago. This sweet substance is ideal for redheads, as it has been shown to help clear acne, eczema or psoriasis, and even skin tone due to its antibacterial and antimicrobial qualities. Make sure to get raw honey, as it will maintain all of its natural properties. Apply as a spot treatment to specific areas of the skin or mix into a mask with a little mashed avocado and raw rolled oats for a fresh, glowing complexion.\\n5. Apple Cider Vinegar\\nGreat for both skin and hair, apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a redhead must have. It acts as a powerful antibacterial and buy diflucan online antifungal treatment, balancing the pH of the skin, clearing acne and exfoliating. When combined with water for a hair rinse (~2 tbsp ACV : 1c water), the acetic acid in ACV removes product build-up and even treat dandruff, leaving your red hair healthy and gorgeous.\\nRock it like a Redhead!',\n",
       " 'Nobody knows how to offend better than the world\\nWho allowed the consequential “tik-tok” of the futile wrist-watch, which by now engraved itself into your wooden side table?\\nAs the light peeked through the juicy, green leaves, the warm summer breeze grazed your cheeks, and the soft chirping of birds filled your ears with an uplifting mantra, the world seemed to be giving little care about whether it’s comforting you. Why did the Warsaw sun decide to come out of the omniscient grey precisely as you settled into the broken chair, painfully squeaky after a year and a half of being abused by your bad sitting habits? Why did the hanging greenery, so full of life and sublimity, almost smirk at you as you peeked your nose out of the dark cave which once used to be your room? Why did the blinking sky force you to breathe deeply and inhale all these views at once when it so clearly took pleasure in your inability to do so?\\nIt just so happens that around the time you got used to living without the world around you, it began to scare you, stripping you of the ability to enjoy the simple, experiential pleasures of life. Your newly developed mental disability is pointed out painfully by your entire surroundings, as they squeeze the very last of your sanity out of you.\\nYou’re infuriated, offended, and taken aback. And with your eyes fatigued by light, ears dreading the soft sounds, and skin imperiled by wind, you return, gaping at the floor, back to your comfort zone, back to your room, as you reject the world which once meant the most to you.\\nThe curtain falls, the comedy ends, but you’re the still life actor, and the world is the laughing audience.\\nAnd backstage? Where are the other actors? You’re not sure. For all you know, they might be over the ocean of wooden floor boards, somewhere in the kitchen, or across the forest of paper-thin walls, yet, through which you barely hear any sounds indicating life. A morose silence fills the backstage, or something that used to be a warm home, with an eerie mist, as if it has been haunted by voice-stealing creatures who devour all radiance and vigour from the fellow actors.\\nThe Harbinger Prize\\nShort Story Competition\\nThe Harbinger Prize Competition 2021\\nSubmit a short story, no longer than 2,000 words, on the subject line:\\nCreate the perfect villain.\\nWith the sun already set, you lose track of time. Who allowed the consequential “tik-tok” of the futile wrist-watch, which by now engraved itself into your wooden side table, to cease all work, and allow the hours to reshape and become more of a slack guideline for when the haunted church bells were meant to ring? No-one. There is no-one around, but you. You and the book you were meant to finish two months ago, your pet begging for a walk, and the Netflix opening sound, which seems to be the only divertisement for the sedentary quiet which had begun to force a white hum into your ears.\\nWith the world asleep, you should have found peace. Yet, you find yourself anxiously snacking on the week-old bag of crisps, the origin of which you’re not certain. The social media feed becomes repetitive, and your brain forms into a brownish slug, slowly treading in search of something moist to subsist its livelihood. All to no avail.\\nIt’s to the melody of your computer, the chirping of your phone, and the slight stench which settled in your claustrophobic cave, that you find the arms of Morpheus. He seems to be the only one who is never disappointing; As he slowly rocks you to and fro, you too settle in the melancholic pit, where, as a hibernating bear, you shall remain until the next day, when the whole show repeats, with the audience amused as ever.\\nYou dreamt a dream – someone is bending over you. Shaking frantically, your parents decide to wreak havoc on your disastrously disorganised room. As she forces you out of bed, your mother shouts, piercing her sharp voice deep into your eardrums – you’re late again. Lackadaisically, you throw on whatever was on the chair yesterday, put on the same old jewelry, which by now has acquired a suspiciously green hue slowly transfering onto your finger. Just as you leave your room, the grey clouds outside the foggy window express their sorrow for you – their fat raindrops almost form a maleficent laughter, baptising the ground which you will haunt on your way to the same place which strips you of any creativity and will to pursue every, single, god-given day.\\nBack and forth, awkwardly encountering other people’s backpacks and shoulders, you sway, becoming one of the thousands of zombies who had decided to plague the metro system this gloomy morning. Look up! In the glass window of the subway door you see something – the image is convoluted, unclear, as if a milky mass passed through the mirrored creature’s eyes.\\nBack bent unnaturally, black under eyes, and a socially awkward smile you put on especially for strangers – this view greets your eyes, rather unenthusiastically. You arrive, finally, yet you must fight your way out of the train station, together with taboons of fellow zombies, never sharing a collective consciousness, yet all having acquired the same goal – get. to. work. Having treaded through constellations of puddles and mazes of curbs – you arrive, at last, fifteen minutes late. Sitting at your desk your body loses all energy, yet is fueled by everlasting anxiety, which will probably run out sometime around five o’clock in the afternoon, when you will be gratefully allowed to repeat the commuter’s track all over again. Next morning, the same screaming, same clothes, same green hue, rain, metro, strangers, work…\\nYou woke up sweating. It was only a nightmare.\\nThe five o’clock sunrise reminded you of where you were. Yet the day doesn’t begin – it doesn’t exist. The wrist watch stopped working; Who is there to tell you “You must get up now!” The sun slowly increases the pace with which it greets you, rising out of its shy initial position, now fully illuminating your sweaty face. Yet despite its swift apparition, the day still hasn’t arrived. At any stage during the 24-hour realm, on which the population commonly agreed, do you decide to move, do something, feel anything. As you rest in the fetal position, you not only now share the responses of a child, you also physically resemble one. And so you will remain, for yet another show to commence.\\nAs the light peeked through the juicy, green leaves, the warm summer breeze grazed your cheeks, and the soft chirping of birds filled your ears with an uplifting mantra, the world seemed to be giving little care about whether it’s comforting you.\\nWhether you like it or not, the world runs on recurring elements – your state as of now, the elementary-human position of your mind and body, your entire being, has become a part of this vicious cycle, which recently began to accelerate with further encouragement to antagonise the outside world.\\nAt this point, the shape of a trolley problem forms: will you keep going down the track of destruction and lead yourself to an inevitable end? Or, will you switch lanes of the speeding trolley and expose yourself to elements you fear, which you aren’t aware of, which have so far forced you to stay crouching, trying to protect yourself from the unknown? Both paths will have skeletons – which one will you choose?',\n",

Through a quick Google and LinkedIN search, you can quickly have a wealth of information about the company and key people you need to do business with. Learn the basics online so your offline connections are richer.\\nHere are some tips to using social media to enhance your sales conversations:\\n- Find out general information about the company, history, and industry trends.\\n- Identify how digitally savvy the business by their digital footprint (company website, blogs and social media).\\n- The “About Us” or “Contact Us” section, may tell you the person you need to reach for your sale. It is better to have a name in mind when you call the company instead of asking for the person blindly.\\n- Learn how the company sets up email for its employees through their website. For instance, if they do firstname.lastname@example.org for their email protocol, you can often determine the email address of the person you need to reach.\\nConnecting with people on social media, especially LinkedIN, is about building a relationship first—not sales. The sales opportunity will come eventually, but it is best to not lead with that.\\nSend your new contact a message online, but don’t pitch them too quickly. It’s tempting, I know.\\nThe initial goal is to build a relationship, add value to the partnership and gain their trust. You do that by engaging with them when they post something on their page. You send them relevant information you found about their industry.

       " \"The Douglas Hotel building has been a stable of the scenery of downtown Urbana in one form or another for almost 200 years.\\nAnd now, after more than a decade of sitting empty and much debate among community leaders through the years about what to do with the historical structure, the Douglas Hotel is prepping for a new chapter.\\nThe Douglas Hotel and the former North and South Elementary Schools are part of a collective renovation project to save the historic buildings and transform them into affordable senior living options.\\nIt all started with some local leaders reaching out to Duane Miller, the president of F&C Legacy Place - a branch of Flaherty & Collins Properties - and a developer who has dedicated much of his career to saving and renovating historical buildings across the country.\\n“I look for these kinds of historic projects,” says Indiana-based Miller. “It all started from a lead that there were some historic buildings that needed saving in Ohio.”\\nConversations led to many meetings between Miller, Flaherty & Collins, the City of Urbana, the Champaign Economic Partnership (CEP), Urbana City Schools' administration and board of education, and Resident Supports and Services, Inc. (RSSI), which is a local non-profit that provides housing for seniors and adults with developmental disabilities.\\nThe 17 units that are being built within the Douglas Hotel weren’t enough to secure the funding Miller wanted for the project. So he began looking to include the former North and South Elementary buildings as well.\\nWith another 24 housing units to be available between the two schools, Miller says the total of 51 units was more of the scale of what he was hoping for to get the project off the ground.\\nThough shutdowns because of the COVID-19 pandemic caused some delays in processing paperwork and funding early this year, Miller says the community-focused group of supporters pushed forward. The project was able to secure $13 million in financing, including federal and state Historic Tax credits, low income housing credits, an Ohio Housing Finance Agency loan, and a construction loan.\\n“That’s really how this got pulled off,” Miller says. “This is totally a community effort – kudos to all those who were involved in helping.”\\nCEP Executive Director Marcia Bailey says she almost had to pinch herself when work officially started on the buildings because it was like a dream come true after so many years of collaboration and work to get the project started.\\n“Today, it looks like ‘ants’ in every building,” Bailey says. “There are construction crews in there, and you can see where they’re working from outside by building by the different lights on in different windows every day.”\\nBailey says that though people driving through downtown Urbana won’t see much of a difference outside the building’s front, that behind the building is full of crews working hard to make all the updates to the interior.\\n“The Douglas Hotel was the anchor of the Southwest corner of downtown,” she says. “Some thought it should be torn down and others wanted to save it because of it’s history. This is the perfect mix of both; it will be revitalized into something new.\\n“The building finally is going to be use. It’s going to be a beautiful building again and not an eyesore with boarded up windows. Just that ambiance of what it’s going to look like, let alone the income that’s going to be generated in the downtown by the merchants – it’s going to be huge.”\\nWith more updates to be done to the Douglas Hotel than to either school building, Miller says the plan is for renovations to the school to wrap up in May and for the Douglas living spaces to be ready by the end of 2021.\\nHe says lease options will open about 90 days before each project’s completion.\\nOne of the things both Bailey and Miller say is most exciting about the projects is the uniqueness that will be offered in each unit.\\nBecause the buildings are pre-existing and historic, there won’t be any “cookie cutter” designs. Units will be different sizes with different layouts and designs.\\nAnd, some special historic features will be left in the buildings so the flavor of what makes them historic won’t be lost.\\nFor example, many of the chalkboards in the school buildings will stay in place and be built into the new living units.\\nAlso in the school buildings, the stages and gyms will remain as open community spaces where residents can dance, play bingo, or possibly even watch youth performances. Miller says he’s working with the Champaign Family YMCA to find possible programming and education opportunities.\\n“We want to build that community environment,” he says. “You want to create that family and that community feeling.”\\nThough Miller himself isn’t from Urbana, he wanted to ensure that the buildings stay meaningful and useful for people locally. He wants them to be a part of the community, and he says the investment from local individuals has been key to the entire project.\\n“To their credit, to their teams’ credit – not every community gets in and do what they do,” Miller says. “You need those ‘boots on the ground’ people who care and really get it. You can’t just pull this off just being a developer. You need to be a developer who plugs into the community and gets support – and that’s just what happened here.”\",\n",
       " 'Volume 3, Issue 7\\nAt ARF’s Re:THINK 2013, Steven Kotler was the luncheon speaker on two days, the second time accompanied by his colleagues Jamie Wheal and Dave Stanton in the Flow Genome Project, which is aimed at helping us become a race of “supermen” through a scientific understanding of what Flow is and how to cultivate it — exactly the purpose of the Human Effectiveness Institute, and increasingly the interest of Daniel Goleman. Naturally I spoke with Steven and offered that the Institute would pitch in in any way.\\nHe came to Flow through a near-death experience and I through stage performances beginning at age 4. He presented an excellent depiction of Flow with breathtaking pictures of mountain climbers, surfers and other types of Flow state performers well documented and obvious in their beingness in Flow. Surely people can realize that this is another state of consciousness, and will become interested through the efforts of many of us in attaining this state, now that they know we can all do it.\\nBut do they believe it? Neither Steven nor I have proven yet that “ordinary people” can become superbeings. Nobody has. Elite military trainers will contend that they do this in a narrow but useful field, and this leads to the larger obvious point that Flow exhibits differently in different people. We all observe it most commonly in sports, which could explain a large part of why sports is such a dominant interest. We see it in great violinists and every other type of musician including those using natural instruments.\\nCreatives of all kinds including artists and scientists and improvisational performers experience Flow internally and it is only “seen” to a degree by others around them, who may largely misunderstand, distort and resist the content of the Aha! Vision if it is shared prematurely.\\nThe average person when in Flow is unaware of it. It occurs during sex, and in loving communication among human beings all the time. This is the real proof that we can all get into Flow. As we let go into engaging with a loved one without any inner blocks, turned on and driven and focused by love we shift into a state of menschness and rise above every ignoble impulse. We do it out of love. This is ethical Flow, ethics being the instrument we are playing. It is one we can all play.\\nThe Aha! Moment is in fact the one “gene” (component, method) that Steven and his colleagues shared. The Flow Genome Project leaders correctly state that the creative process leading up to and including the Aha! Moment — which is the natural creative process as manifested in humans — involves four stages:\\nStage 1: Absorb the firehose of information about the challenge\\nStage 2: Go away and have fun, forget all about the garbled mountain of info now doing things to itself in your subconscious\\nStage 3: The Aha! Moment\\nStage 4: Organize and communicate, carry through to real-world implementation validation success of the Aha! Vision\\nOutgoing ARF CEO Bob Barocci opened the third day’s session by reporting a conversation he had with Steven. I’ll relate that in the next post. Before I go however I want to say that Bob has done more for the ARF than anyone else. His predecessors were all giants in that field of applied communications psychology we call marketing, advertising and media research. Bob is a Renaissance Man.\\nHis predecessor Jim Spaeth had opened up the ARF to whole new ways of thinking and Bob took that to a beautiful extreme inspiring a coalescence of researchers from across traditional, digital, and social, putting the ARF on a firm financial footing for perhaps the first time in its long history. Bob’s successor, the former Chief Research Officer at General Mills, Gayle Fuguitt inherits a solid base and forward momentum to guide in the directions she feels are best for the industry/scientific sub-community, and for society.\\nWith Flow and authentic social motives on the agenda, the ARF can lead more than the research industry in the years ahead. There’s an Aha! Vision for you.\\nBest to all,',\n",

       " 'Presenting opposite views on nuclear energy\\nReports on last week’s groundbreaking ceremony for the Akkuku nuclear power plant in southern Turkey made headlines in many newspapers, including Hürriyet.\\nOne of our readers, Müzeyyen Huş, criticized our coverage of the ceremony. “You did not refer to any anti-nuclear power views. You also ran a prominent story on the promotional video prepared by the Energy Ministry regarding the plant. Do you not think readers have the right to know what opposing views are?” she said.\\nOn April 4, Hürriyet’s front page had a headline reading “Button pressed to complete Akkuyu by 2023.” On other pages the headlines read: “The first layer of a new age,” “Healthier energy,” and “This is a turning point.” Indeed, there was no coverage of anti-nuclear views.\\nMüzeyyen Huş was right. Environmentalists have been speaking out against the project ever since it became clear that a power plant would be built in Akkuyu. Particularly following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011, the anti-nuclear movement gained strength everywhere, with some European countries laying out plans to close their nuclear power plants.\\nHürriyet did not mention those reactions or the anti-nuclear movement around the world. What’s more, the newspaper did not cover the incident that took place on the very same day, when members of an environmentalist group, the Mersin Anti-Nuclear Platform, visited parliament and police prevented them from demonstrating. We also failed to report critical statements made by some NGOs and associations.\\nLater, when it reported Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım’s message to “those who criticize the Akkuyu plant,” Hürriyet used the headline: “Let’s keep a cool head.” However, it did not publish the views of those who are against the nuclear power plant.\\nWhether pro- or anti-nuclear voices are right or wrong is immaterial. What really matters from the journalism point of view is giving a platform for all views on such a controversial issue, as readers can make up their own minds only if they have complete information. Simply reporting whatever politicians say cannot provide this complete information.\\nIn April 2015, Hürriyet reported protests staged against the Akkuyu power plant when foundations were laid for marina structures and the port. This way, we reported both positive and negative views regarding the nuclear power plants.\\nIt is clear that sponsorship is part of cultural life, social life, sports and the arts. Many such events can only take place thanks to sponsors.\\nThere is also no doubt that a company or an individual gains something when they sponsor an event. Companies become sponsors because sponsorship effectively serves the function of a commercial.\\nŞule Kartal, a communication advisor at a local company, recently emailed me regarding the role of the media in sponsorship relations.\\n“On your website’s basketball section, for some time the name of Muratbey Uşak Sportif appears only as ‘Uşak Sportif.’ The company Muratbey is the official sponsor of Uşak Sportif and due to the agreement between them the sports club uses ‘Muratbey’ in its name. I kindly request that you make the necessary corrections,” Kartal wrote.\\nThe agreement referred to was made between the club and the company, but it is endorsed by the media. The company inked a deal with the sports club, gives money but it is the media that publishes its commercial for free. In the Super League, football clubs make a lot of money from sponsors but the media gets nothing. What’s more, the line between commercial and news becomes blurry.\\nMaybe that is why we should perhaps discuss whether the names of sponsors should be used in sports events or for sports clubs, or whether certain ground rules should be established.',\n",

       " '“I’m just concerned about her. I think if they went to counseling they could make it work. I mean, that’s what marital counseling is for; when a husband and wife are unable to effectively communicate. If they refuse to go see someone, well, then…I’m not sure there’s much else they can do.”\\nI sat sipping my hot cup of Starbucks coffee, and like a gifted storyteller, shared with my girlfriend Jenny every juicy detail of my friend Maureen’s troubled marriage.\\n“They don’t even have sex anymore because she’s put on so much weight since her baby was born. I mean, I understand she’s self-conscious of her body. I totally empathize with that, but I just wish she’d take care of herself, ya know?”\\nJenny shook her head like a good friend does to let me know she was eager for me to continue. “I’m just glad that I have such a good marriage. Patrick and I have a great thing going on and it’s because we respect each other. We spend time with one another. Maureen and her husband don’t even pray together. I suspect that’s a big reason why this is all happening.” I said.\\nI’m surprised Jenny could hear a single word I was saying from down below when I was sitting so far up on my high horse. By the time I had cited the 5th example of why I had a joy-filled marriage and Maureen and her husband had a rotten one, I started getting a little tired of hearing myself speak. Just then, Jenny probed a bit more. “Do you think there’s danger of him cheating?” I could tell by the way she leaned in toward me she hoped my answer would be “Yes.”\\n“I don’t know. I don’t know if he’d cheat.” I quickly replied. I felt slightly dignified for not suggesting that I knew what the future might hold for the two of them; almost a bit redeemed. Yet seemingly out of nowhere, I had this sick guilty feeling in the pit of my stomach. I decided to zip my lips for a moment and check in with that inner voice to see what was going on.\\n“What am I doing?” I asked myself. “Am I really concerned about Maureen and her husband? What benefit is there for having this conversation? How in the world was I enjoying talking about such a tragic event like a possible divorce? They have children!” I spent the next couple seconds silently shaming myself. When I started to feel the tears well up in my eyes, I rejoined our conversation by letting Jenny know I had to go. “I have a million things to do today. I’m going to head back to my house.”\\nOnce we parted ways, I spent some time thinking about my initial intention of involving Jenny in Maureen’s personal life. After doing so, I realized that I was just thrilled to have a piece of gossip to share. I wasn’t really seeking godly counsel or unburdening my troubled heart to a trusted friend like I had pretended. I was just sinning. And I was enjoying it way too much. I liked having interesting news. I was bored and wanted something to talk about. With this stark realization, a strong wave of guilt and shame overcame me. Here my friend confided in me her problems, and not only did I share them with someone else, but I did so to provide a source of entertainment. It was easier to spend my idle time that day talking about her life than doing the hard work it takes to focus on my own. What’s worse is, I had subconsciously disguised my sin as honest concern for my friend and claimed the darkness in my heart was something Spirit-filled. I found myself in one of the most dangerous predicaments as a Christian; deeply entangled in offense and in absolute denial about my ungodly behavior.\\nThanks to our glorious God, there is a way out; even for a girl like me.\\n1. Come clean with yourself. Unintentionally, I had tried to pretend that I was merely concerned for Maureen. As long as I continued to lie to myself, I would be unable to come before the thrown of God and ask Him to right my wrong.\\nProverbs 28:13 He who covers his sins will not prosper,But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.\\n2. Admit it; gossip is bad. Really, really bad. Magazines line our shelves with alluring headlines about celebrity gossip. Our society has convinced itself that it’s guilt-free entertainment to talk poorly about other people. But tabloids shouldn’t define what’s morally upright. To know what is truly righteous in life, we must read God’s word. And God puts gossip on His list of 6 abominable things that He detests.\\nProverbs 6:17-19 These six things the Lord hates…A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil,A false witness who speaks lies,And one who sows discord among brethren.\\n3. Repent. Once you’ve recognized how sinful an act gossiping is, seek forgiveness and ask that God provide for you a way out. It’s not enough to merely be sorry. God asks that we confess our sins and turn from them to find His favor.\\nEzekiel 18:30-32 Repent! And turn from all your transgressions, so iniquity will not be your ruin.\\n4. Cling to Jesus: We can’t release ourselves from the tight grip sin has on us by fixating our eyes on the rules and laws that God has given us. Paul tells us “For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death” (Romans 7:5) As Spirit filled followers of Christ, we are called to be free, to walk by the Spirit which enables us to live a noble life.\\nGalatians 5:23: Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.\\nJessica Gavin is a freelance writer, committed wife and mother, and follower of Jesus living deliberately in the suburbs of Richmond, VA.

Originally financed in 2005, the new centre recently ended its open call for naming suggestions and is expected to open this April.\\nA committee will review the suggested name and select the best, to be revealed at the building’s upcoming opening.\\nHowever, not all are in support of relocating the manuscripts. Danish academics have resisted possible repatriation, stating the manuscripts are a part of Danish cultural heritage as well.\\nSome Icelandic academics have likewise cast doubt on the utility of bringing certain manuscripts back to Iceland. In 2019, professor Viðar Pálsson at the University of Iceland stated: “From a purely academic point of view, if the manuscripts go home to Iceland, I do not know in what way, if any, it would strengthen scholarship there.”\\nHighlighting the potential dangers of transporting historical manuscripts, he further stated: “In the past centuries, people defined what manuscripts were considered Icelandic. Many of the manuscripts would fall into a grey area, but virtually all manuscripts that we can say are mainly Icelandic have been brought back. But there are also some manuscripts that we could describe as rather Icelandic than anything else that we may nevertheless want to recover at some point. Of course, there are manuscripts in the Danish archives containing prized Icelandic sagas, but then there were manuscripts containing more prosaic legal material, royal narrative material and so on that originate in Iceland but are not necessarily Icelandic in content.”\\nDespite such objections, Minister of Culture and Trade Lilja Alfreðsdóttir has been eager to acquire the manuscripts on behalf of the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies.\\nThe manuscripts in question would be displayed with the latest technologies at the new centre. Estimates state that the long-term loan will cost some 250 million ISK [$1.8 million; €1.7 million].\\nAccording to RÚV, the loan request is currently being processed by the Arnamagnæan Institute in Copenhagen.

       " 'Episode 23: Michael Griffin discusses his tenure as NASA administrator and the challenges of space exploration\\n// Oct 25, 2016\\nOn March 11, 2005, President George W. Bush announced his intention to nominate Griffin to serve as the 11th Administrator of NASA. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 13, 2005 and served until January 20, 2009. Griffin knew NASA well. He had been NASA’s associate administrator for exploration in the early 1990s, as well as its chief engineer.\\nGriffin holds seven academic degrees—a BA in physics from Johns Hopkins University, a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering from the University of Maryland, and a handful of Master’s degrees.\\nHe previously served as deputy for technology at the strategic defense initiative organization (SDIO) in the Pentagon. Griffin’s career has also included academic and corporate positions. He was an eminent scholar and professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Alabama-Huntsville and space department head at the Applied Physics Laboratory at John Hopkins.\\nGriffin was also president and chief operating officer at In-Q-Tel, a private, nonprofit enterprise funded by the Central Intelligence Agency to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve national security interests.\\nTime magazine named Griffin one of its 100 most influential people in 2008.\\nIn his spare time, Griffin enjoys flying and is a certified flight instructor. He’s also a voracious reader and an avid golfer.\\nOn August 14, 2012, the Schafer Corporation announced that Griffin would assume the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the company.\\nGriffin has also been a guest lecturer at IHMC in Pensacola, where in 2009, he delivered a lecture entitled “What the Hubble Space Telescope Teaches Us About Ourselves:” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMdORG8OyU.\\nIn this episode, STEM-Talk host Dawn Kernagis monitors an interview conducted by co-hosts Ken Ford and Tom Jones, both of whom have a long-standing professional relationship with Griffin.\\n1:09: Ford calls Mike Griffin “a remarkable fellow.” Griffin’s work has spanned academia, government and industry. He holds six graduate degrees and was working on his seventh when President George W. Bush selected him to serve as the eleventh NASA administrator.\\n2:35: Dawn reads a five-star iTunes review from “Meatballs Mom” entitled “Thumbs up.” “I downloaded this in order to feel intellectually superior to my peers. It’s totally working.”\\n3:00: Dawn describes Griffin’s career and educational accomplishments.\\n5:13: Dawn introduces Mike Griffin, along with hosts Ford and Jones.\\n6:03: Griffin’ interest in science was sparked by the first book, called “A Child’s Book of Stars,” that his mother gave him for Christmas in 1954, when he was five years old.\\n7:50: “I was already fully committed to a career in math and science and space long before I got to high school,” Griffin recalls, also noting an influential physics teacher in high school who encouraged him on that path.\\n8:25: “My career has gone back and forth between and among DOD space, civil space, robotic scientific space craft and missions and human space flight.”\\n8:50: Griffin notes that one of the highlights of his career was being chief engineer for the first space intercept mission accomplished against a booster in powered flight as part of early missile defense program under President Ronald Reagan.\\n12:08: “Possibly the coolest job that I’ve ever had,” Griffin says, was as President of In-Q-Tel, which he loosely categorizes as the CIA’s venture capital company. “The CIA didn’t have access to the hi-tech of Silicon Valley, so the non-profit was chartered by Congress to allow that access. It was an extraordinarily eye-opening and exciting adventure,” he says, adding that they helped create Google Earth.\\n14:22: Griffin had an early hunch that he would work for NASA, which he did four different times during his career. “NASA formed in 1958, and I was nine years old. I was already interested in space, and from that time forward, I believed that I would eventually work there.”\\n15:20: “When I was very young, I thought that being an engineer/scientist was the highest goal anyone could aspire to.”\\n16:10: Early in his career, Griffin was also spotted for managerial talent, becoming the youngest group supervisor at the jet propulsion laboratory.\\n17:04: Griffin says that he managed NASA, a 20-billion-dollar organization, just as he would a much smaller organization. “What you are doing is trying very carefully to select a great team of people who can complement your own skills, but who are not the same as you,” he says, adding that managing a large organization is not substantially different than a small one—only there are more layers.\\n19:50: “Dealing with official Washington” was also challenging during his tenure at NASA; in other words, the organizations that have a stake in what NASA does. And dealing with Congress.\\n20:20: Space exploration is one area that can elevate a nation’s profile in history. “I contend that a nation that does not explore frontiers of time is consigning itself to the backwaters of history.”\\n21:15: “I believe the values of Westerners are superior to those which have evolved previously or elsewhere. Space is a human frontier, and some humans somewhere at sometime will open it up and settle it; and we will use the resources of the solar system to our benefit. Decisions will be made by nations that show up. I want my nation to be in the vanguard of those efforts.”\\n22:25: Griffin explains the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster that occurred in 2003, in which all seven crew members were lost. “It was brought about by the unintended release of a large piece of foam… which impacted a wing at high speed; and broke a hole in the thermal insulation tiles that protect the shuttle on entry, and because of that the vehicle and the crew were lost.”\\n22:54: “There was never supposed to be any foam release,” Griffins says, adding that there were continual foam release events that were not understood. “When I took over, I chartered a group of people to study that issue.”\\n24:00: The mentality changed from “always three months from flight” to “We’ll fly when we understand why this is happening and can fix it.” They realized they were never going to completely mitigate foam release, but they could have some control over the size of the pieces and when they came off, as well as the damage statistics to the orbiter. Jim Peters of NASA Johnson Space Center was influential in reading statistical properties of foam release and damage.\\n26:50: President George W. Bush and Congress supported finishing the space station, but there were “deep divisions of opinion within Washington bureaucracy on whether to do that…. I took it as my most important mission a plan by which we would finish the station.”\\n28:04: “We went to our European and Russian partners and outlined a plan by which we would finish the station (by minimizing the number of utilization flights—for scientific experiments—and maximizing assembly flights.) The goal was to get the project finished and utilize it later.”\\n29:49: Commercial break: STEM-Talk is an educational service of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, a not-for-profit research lab pioneering ground-breaking technologies aimed at leveraging human cognition, perception, locomotion and resilience.\\n30:46: “In the immediate aftermath of Columbia, only shuttle flights would go to the space station. If there was another Columbia-like incident, you could park the crew at the station until a rescue shuttle could be used to get them off. Other missions were deemed too risky.”\\n31:32: Griffin disagreed with that pronouncement, arguing that there are only a small percentage of things that can go wrong with an orbiter on ascent for which space station is the answer to the problem. The other thing was that there were ways around having a rescue mission (without having an available space station).\\n32:40: After joining NASA, Griffin says he “got smart folks from the Johnson Space Center” looking at how we could arrange a safe Hubble repair mission.\\n34:00: When the Columbia shuttle was lost, any use of another orbiter for a Hubble-type mission put a delay in the space station completion schedule.\\n34:53: Ford recalls the “STS-125 as the highlight of the shuttle program. The afternoon of launch, looking at two shuttles gleaming in the sun, sitting at the ready on their pads…that was an awesome sight.”\\n36:10: Jones asks about the inability to launch astronauts to the space station since the shuttles retired in 2011.\\n36:50: “The plan was to return the shuttle to flight, finish the space station and construct a new system capable of going to the station and to the moon. It was a U.S.-led international effort to develop a lunar base.”\\n38:56: During the [George W.] Bush administration, we opened up a gap between the last shuttle flight and the first flight of a new system. That gap was supposed to have been two years, and it became four.\\n39:30: The space station was a 75-billion-dollar endeavor. “I thought we should be doing everything in our power to make sure that it was sustained and used properly. And to do that, you needed to be able to visit the station at least a couple times a year.”\\n40:45: Griffin talks about the U.S. government’s increased reliance on commercial space companies, which he says was misguided.\\n43:27: Companies developing these capabilities on government funding are saying 2018 is the earliest successful crew deployment from U.S. shores.\\n45:18: Griffin calls exploration and science “closely allied enterprises.” “Many explorations in history also yielded important scientific results. But the careful planning of scientific experiments, their conduct, is quite substantially different.” He adds that science is critical to good exploration.\\n47:37: “Human space flight is replete with opportunities for life science to advance itself. The two enterprises are synergistic.”\\n48:33: “When I took over NASA, the advisory council seemed to have no really useful end. We had a host of individual advisory committees on specific topics.”\\n51:40: Griffin organized a NASA advisory council first under Harrison Schmitt and then Ken Ford. All advisory committees reported up through the principals on the NASA Advisory Council who were selected for their expertise in different specialties. “That brought order to discussions/allowed the advisory council to come forward with actionable requests of the NASA career staff; and to shape the budget in ordered/intelligent ways to make better use of the science budget from Congress.”\\n53:38: “If we have our wits about us, we will be using robots to augment human exploration and humans to augment robotic exploration in every reasonable way that we can do.”\\n55:04: “No one wants people on Mars more than I do, and I believe the best path to do that is through the Moon, which will in and of itself be fascinating.”\\n55:45: The vast majority (70 percent) of the U.S. pop supports NASA and its goals. What is missing, Griffin says, is the translation of public approval into coherent policy that can go from one administration to another.\\n57:15: Griffin calls space exploration “hobby entertainment for newly elected political leaders.” Their stance towards the Marines, or Air Force, for example, is vastly different.\\n1:00:22: Deep space exploration beyond Mars is very difficult without nuclear propulsion systems.\\n1:08: Maintaining crew health in closed environments is going to be very difficult. “When we can put a crew on an international space station for 6-7 months and let them de-condition and send them to the moon for a year, back to the space station and then bring them home—then we’ll know we’re ready to go to Mars, and not before.”\\n1:02:47: Commercial break: STEM-Talk is an educational service of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, a not-for-profit research lab pioneering ground-breaking technologies aimed at leveraging human cognition, perception, locomotion and resilience.\\n1:03:30: “We must have a long-term, carefully structured, coherent policy on what the U.S. will do in space, why we will do it, who we will do it with; and how that will be consistent with the funding that we supply.”\\n1:06:00: Griffin looks back at Apollo, which “barely succeeded in the political sense.” The White House was cutting the NASA budget during Apollo 11. “’While success was being had, cancellation was occurring,” he says, adding this was “a huge lost opportunity.”\\n1:07:27: The success of Apollo was partly due to President John F. Kennedy’s succinct declaration of what was to be done: “Land a man on the moon, return him safely to the earth, do it before decade is up.”\\n1:08:00: The U.S. at that time was also in a battle with the USSR for the hearts and minds of the non-aligning nations of the world, he adds. “We felt it was important to be ahead in space.”\\n1:08:35: “Apollo probably benefitted from Kennedy’s assassination. It is unlikely we would have been able to go forward had not a martyred president stood behind it.”\\n1:12:50: One of the problems across the aerospace industry is that people are not entering the profession. The average age of the NASA work force is in fifties. During Apollo the average age was the twenties. “We need a combination.”\\n1:15:12: Griffin wrote a lengthy paper for the 50th anniversary of Sputnik saying that it would have been better to use the hardware infrastructure they had developed during Apollo and repurpose it for other things.\\n1:18:12: Griffin paraphrases Wayne Hale, a former shuttle program manager, and space shuttle flight director, in a speech last October in which Hale said that he was tired of the controversy about whether or not we should build a heavy lifter (versus an orbital assembly of smaller pay loads.) “You cannot prove that you would not have been able to do the Berlin airlift with a large number of piper cups, but the logistics would be forbidding… The laws of physics don’t prevent an in-orbit assembly of very large machines to go to Mars by using many smaller launch vehicles. But it is logistically forbidding. It is likely to be much more expensive and time-consuming.”\\n1:19:28: “To believe otherwise—that we would not want the largest transportation capability that we could put together—is to single space flight out from all other modes of transportation that humans have ever used.”\\n1:21:10: “If we are serious about space exploration, we need a heavy lifter.”\\n1:22:22: Griffin says that during the next trip to the moon, we should mine the lunar crust for oxygen. “The lunar surface is a good source of oxygen, and extractable for solar energy. As an industrial process, I believe that’s one of the first things we’ll do.”\\n1:23:45: Griffin elaborates on his views regarding the possibility of a commercially-developed space transportation system capable of Mars missions.\\n1:29:56: The U.S. partnership in space with Russia and other European nations has been a really good thing. We’ve learned a lot from Russians in space, and they’ve learned a lot from us.\\n1:33:38: Ford asks Griffin about his passion for flying. “I’ve been flying for decades, as a general aviation pilot. Flying is consuming. When you’re departing/arriving other concerns don’t weigh on you in that moment. I enjoy that feeling of commitment.”\\n1:37:06: Griffin is also a voracious reader. During the period in which the interview was conducted, he was reading “The Innovators” (about the development of the computer industry), as well as “Into the Black,” about the development of the space shuttle. He also likes “junk fiction,” science fiction, The Economist and Science News.\\n1:38:30: Another hobby: “I do love golf. It appeals to people with an analytical mind set.”\\n1:39:00: Ken and Tom thank Mike for the terrific interview on STEM-Talk.\\n1:39:50 Dawn and Ken talk about the interview, direct the listener to the episode’s show-notes, and sign off.',\n",
       " 'Chicago almost hits bottom rank of 150 cities for high cost, poor services\\nOut of 150 cities, Chicago came in almost at the bottom when the quality of city services and the total budget per capita were ranked, confirming what most Chicagoans already knew.\\nTaxpayers have been asked to pay more for water and sewer use, 3 cents a gallon more for gasoline, rideshares, and other taxes, fines and fees. Chicago’s 10.25% sales tax is the nation’s highest combined rate for a major city. Even listening to Spotify or watching Netflix is hit with a 9% amusement tax.\\nThen there are property taxes. On average, from 2000 to 2019, residential property taxes in Chicago rose by 164%. They rose $543 million just during former Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s term and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in her current budget added $94 million in property taxes, plus created automatic annual increases tied to inflation.\\nSo when the cost of city government was compared to the quality, Chicago ranked 141 out of the nation’s 150 largest cities, according to researchers at personal finance website WalletHub.\\nWalletHub based its rankings on a combination of the quality of city services and the city budget per capita. It measured city efficiency – whether city residents were getting a good return for their tax dollars. Low costs and great services ranked high, while high costs and poorer services ranked low.\\nIn addition to an overall score, WalletHub provided individual scores for quality of services and for total budget per capita. Chicago did poorly on both measures, ranking 136th for cost per capita and 140th for service. Washington, D.C., took the bottom spot overall, but even though its costs per person were the highest in the survey it services ranked relatively high in quality at No. 30. Detroit offered the worst city services, with costs ranking at 99th.\\nChicago’s heavy tax burden would be less of a problem were taxpayers getting value for their money. High costs in Seattle, Washington and New York City translated into high quality services, WalletHub found.\\nSo where is Chicago’s money going?\\nChicago’s pension debt is largely to blame for the city’s high expenditures crowding out the public services taxpayers expect for their money and that can protect housing values.\\nThe problem will get worse without meaningful pension reform.\\nFor fiscal year 2022, the city projected its pension contributions will balloon to $2.25 billion. That amount may underestimate the problem because Chicago recently adopted actuarially-based funding. This would represent, at minimum, a $375 million increase. That amount exceeds the city’s yearly expenditure on City Development, which includes the Department of Housing, Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and Department of Planning and Development.\\nIf the yearly increase in pension payments exceeds amounts spent on alleviating homelessness, promoting sustainable growth and providing affordable housing, the city and its residents have a problem. That problem is expected to grow.\\nAnnual contributions to city pension funds were already projected to rise by $1 billion during the course of Lightfoot’s first term in office. Even after the $375 million increase expected in 2022, the city’s projections in the budget, which run through 2026, show ever-escalating annual pension contributions.\\nDespite Chicago’s rapidly rising taxpayer-funded pension payments, it is unlikely they will be sufficient to meet Chicago’s obligations. The city’s eight pension funds – including the four funds to which the city contributes directly and four funds for related entities funded by the same taxpayers – have accumulated nearly $47 billion in debt, more than 44 U.S. states. Those pensions are only 34% funded overall, meaning they have 34 cents saved for every $1 in future promises. Pension experts consider plans below 40% funding to be past the point of no return and on the path to insolvency or major cuts.\\nThe money to fund these pensions must come from somewhere, and keeping up with this growing financial burden is a core reason Chicago taxes have increased in recent years. For the most part, recent city tax hikes have not been implemented to provide better roads or sanitation or to reduce the violence plaguing the city. Rather, taxpayers have seen their burdens increase largely in order to fund pension systems.\\nLocal politicians understand runaway pension debt is an issue, yet little has been done to address the problem. Lightfoot herself has sent mixed messages on pension reform, often acknowledging the depth of the problem and calling for change while failing to provide specifics. She has criticized 3% compounded post-retirement annual raises as “unsustainable,” but has not publicly endorsed a constitutional amendment, which is the only way to change them. In contrast, in his last months in office, Emanuel called upon Springfield to send a pension reform amendment to the ballot for voter approval.\\nIn addition to being primarily responsible for Chicago’s increasing tax burden, pensions have also begun crowding out core government services.\\nThis trend has been particularly noticeable at the state level, but it has also begun manifesting itself at the local level. Since 2011, Chicago’s inflation-adjusted pension payments have increased by 239%. At the same time, city spending on services has increased by just 18%.\\nIt is this dynamic that largely prevents Chicago from providing services on par with its high-tax peers in New York and Seattle. Both cities levy high taxes, but in the absence of crushing unfunded pension debt they are able to direct those taxpayer dollars back toward services for their citizens.\\nCity leaders know the rapid rise in pension costs has hurt Chicago’s ability to invest in the core services valued by residents, yet meaningful reform has remained elusive. Rising taxes and declining services can be expected until the state amends the Illinois Constitution to allow for the control of future government pension growth.',\n",
       " 'Seeing a new continent, country or city can be overwhelming and exciting, even for regular travelers. Before you get your flights booked and bags packed, take a minute to read through the following tips to help you minimize travel stress and maximize your vacation enjoyment.\\nIf you have children traveling with you, make sure you have a current, color photo of them with you, in the event they become lost. Losing track of a child can be very frightening. The fact remains, however, that it is not unheard of. If you have a picture of your child on hand, it can really help to locate him or her in a crowd more quickly.\\nPlan ahead if you want to travel by air. Most airports are close to major urban areas, making them difficult to get to at busy times of day, like rush hour. Do all of your packing the day before. Get your preparations ready before you fly. It feels terrible to miss your flight.\\nWhen vacationing in a foreign country, be careful what you eat. If you do have an allergy, you will need to have a good handle on the language of the country you are eating in. You’ll be able to tell waitstaff in restaurants about your allergies before there’s a problem and you have to explain to medical professionals.\\nLook at your alarm when you get to a hotel. You do not want to be subject to the alarm needs of the previous guest. Make sure you check the alarm clock and make sure it’s set for a time that is good for you;, otherwise, you might find yourself off to a terrible start on your vacation.\\nWhen it comes to planning your trip, choose a digital camera that is in sync with your trip and its needs. If you want to go backpacking, you’ll want to pack a rechargeable battery. In nearly all cases, a digital camera with an that focuses quickly is best to avoid missing that perfect shot.\\nIncrease safety at hotels by bringing along a door stop. You may not have access to the type of security that you think is acceptable. If you don’t find a chain or deadbolt on the door, put a small doorstop beneath the door at bedtime.\\nWhen flying on a plane, you should plan ahead because an airline won’t always be able to meet your basic needs, even when the flight lasts for many hours. Be sure to bring a blanket, headphones or pillow if you think you’ll need them. You may also want to purchase a snack before boarding the plane.\\nMake sure that you have clothespins with you on your next vacation. They can be a useful item when you go on a trip, even though they are not something someone thinks to bring with them.\\nSign up for a travel price watcher. This is a feature many travel sites use, and allows you to enter the destination you want and it will watch for deals for you. When the hotel or airfare price drops by the amount chosen, the site ends you an email alert. This takes the work out of your needing to check the prices everyday.\\nWhen to travel by plane or car with a toddler, make sure you have enough fun things to keep them occupied. Pack some of his favorite games and toys. It is also a good idea to buy a new toy just for the trip, as it will provide a little novelty and help keep a small child’s attention.\\nWhen you are going to some type of attraction, print online tickets in advance. Even if there’s a fee, it is very much worth it to be able to skip the long lines for purchasing tickets at the venue. Also, parks sometimes offer timed entry, and if they do, you can use your tickets to get right to the admission line.\\nWorkout at the gym the day before you take your flight. Long flights are taxing on your body and nerves. Not to mention the effects sitting for long time can have on your body. You can have more energy at the end of your flight when your warm up and stretch before takeoff.\\nBring a business card with you at all times. This will help you get directions from locals if you get lost. It is particularly useful for those who haven’t mastered the language.\\nConsider buying bottled water once you arrive or melt the hotel ice to get filtered water for making coffee. Rather than drinking tap water, put ice in the ice bucket and let it all melt overnight. In the morning, you will be able to brew a better-tasting coffee with this water.\\nYou should be aware of the insurance policies available from your credit card company and their particular policies involving foreign countries. You might be already covered for cancelled flight that get charged to the card. It will be worth it to do this research prior to your trip.\\nFind out as soon as possible whether you require a visa to enter the country you are travelling to. Visas often have a lengthy processing time so you should apply for them as soon an you are thinking of travel. If you do not have a visa and your destination requires it, then you will not be able to enter.\\nWhen making a hotel reservation, ask if the hotel is doing any renovations. There are few things more annoying than waking to the sound of construction equipment while you are enjoying a vacation. Avoid staying in a hotel that is undergoing construction.\\nIf you use traveler’s checks, make sure the cash them prior to dining or shopping. Traveler’s checks are generally accepted at most places, but they are a hassle. Rather than using these, get local currency to spend.\\nDeserts have great views and interesting plants and animals. Visiting the desert for the first time can be an especially exciting adventure; it’s something you should do at least once during your lifetime, just to experience the awe and wonder of the desert.\\nIf visiting National Parks is in the cards for your vacation, consider purchasing an official National Park Pass. It’s only $50 annually, and it covers your entry to all the national parks.\\nSometimes, the best way to deal with a red-eye flight is to have a sleeping pill to take once you are settled on the plane. Many people find it difficult to sleep on an airplane, between the unfamiliar surroundings, uncomfortable seats, and passenger and aircraft noise. If you want a surefire way to make it through your flight, try taking a sleeping pill in order to relax, calm down and sleep through it. Don’t take any pills until after the plan has taken off. If there is an issue or delay you would be sleeping in the terminal!\\nIf you plan to hit the road with a small child, take breaks every two or three hours on the road. Breaks give you the chance to stretch out and go to the bathroom. If you get your kids away from the car now and then, you can keep them from getting motion sickness. Your trip might get longer, but you will appreciate the drop in stress.\\nDocumentation is key, so be sure to discover what kinds of visas you will need to enter any countries you will be traveling to. Acquiring a visa can be a lengthy process, so do not wait until the last minute to apply. If you don’t have the correct visa, you won’t be allowed to enter some countries.\\nAny great vacation can go awry if proper research time is not used in the planning. Search the Internet for travel reviews from people who have already been to that location. Their experience can help you avoid staying in a dangerous town or seedy hotel.\\nUse environmentally responsible services to ensure your vacation is eco-friendly. You can save money on electricity by not overusing the bulbs. Car rental companies, tour operators, restaurants and other service providers are implementing ways that allow travelers to be able to travel green.\\nThink about what type of transportation you’re going to use. The bus has changed a lot over the years. You can get affordable tickets on buses that are clean, have free wireless Internet and even electrical outlets. You might find bundle deals from some bus lines that will make your planning simple.\\nPack a couple of travel candles for your hotel stay. Scented candles can eliminate offending mystery scents in hotel rooms. Candles are relaxing, give off a wonderful glow and are romantic. You can buy these candles in miniature sizes, and they are usually drip free.\\nIf issues arise with regard to travel plans, it can be quite frustrating. Flights are cancelled and rental cars disappear. In these predicaments, the only two who can handle the problem are the agent and you. You may get frustrated while trying to sort out the problem. Stay calm and be polite. You can get more accomplished this way.\\nFind the service stops on your journey while driving. You never know when you are going to hit a long, isolated stretch of highway. When planning your route, look for possible service stations that will be able to service your vehicle. Keep the numbers handy in case you need to use them.\\nKeep flight delays to a minimum by booking a flight as early in the morning as you can. Airports are typically filled to capacity; if the first plane is delayed there is a domino effect, because each plane must wait for the last one to fly out and make room at the gate. Morning flights have less chances of being delayed.\\nActivities help take the boredom out of road trips. Rather than just taking meal and bathroom breaks, the trip will be more entertaining. Give your kids an itinerary of your route so they can focus on that destination en route to the main location.\\nIf traveling abroad, write out some cards that contain dietary restrictions in the language spoken by locals in your destination country. If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you can use this idea to let your servers know what you can and can’t eat. This information can help to ensure that all your dining experiences are enjoyable on your trip.\\nIf you don’t like flight delays, get the earliest flight you can. Since airports are usually filled to their capacity, if one plane is delayed, more then likely the plane after that will be delayed, too, since it has to wait for the gate to open up. The first flight during the morning is very limited with delays.\\nMake certain to pack your medicines. When a person is preparing to leave for a trip or vacation, they sometimes forget to pack the most important items, including medications. Your destination location may not have the ability to fulfill your prescriptions, especially through your insurance plan.\\nDon’t forget to pack your child’s car seat when you hire a rental car. The car seat that you own is probably better than the one a rental company would supply, and your seat is one that your child is comfortable with.\\nDo not use the airport to exchange currency. It is very convenient to do it there, but the rates are typically sky high. You can avoid having to do this by searching out nearby banks and exchange centers prior to embarking on your travels.\\nWhen you go on a trip, don’t forget your contact lens case. If you are only using a small bit of these products, carry them in one of these containers.\\nBe sure you have enough time when it comes to checking out of the hotel. A lot of hotels will charge you steep fees if you don’t manage to check out of your room by the time that they specify. You definitely always want extra check out time.\\nWith these tips in mind, your next trip could be the journey of a lifetime. No matter your level of travel experience, you can look forward to a great trip.\\nMake sure contact information listing your name and telephone number is on a label which can easily be found inside your luggage. If you lose your belongings, someone might return them to your address. The more times you see your luggage, the more chances you have in preventing losing your belongings.',\n",
       " 'Do you want to begin an interior design project as a way of beautifying your living space? You aren’t alone, and the following article will help you learn about design. The following advice has been well-tested and can go far in helping you succeed.\\nBefore you start working in a room, decide the kind of mood you want the room to present. The mood of a room can range from calm and soothing to exciting and outrageous. Deciding on the mood of the space beforehand will have a big impact on the choices you make and will help to give the space a cohesive feel.\\nMix patterns and textures to create a sophisticated design in any room. These textures help to draw the eye and add interest to otherwise boring items. If you are trying to make your room look better, you have to mix up your colors and patterns.\\nKeep art at eye level to maximize the effect of your investment. Hanging a piece of art too high or too low throws the balance of your room and can even make the room look smaller and more disorganized.\\nLower the costs of your interior decorating projects by seeking out the same high quality designs from mass merchants. It is not always necessary to pay designer prices for the high end designer look. Only purchase the designer brands when you cannot find a comparable, inexpensive alternative.\\nKeep your room as uncluttered as possible when you are making changes to your interior’s design. Using too many pieces of furnishings, the room can look smaller and cramped. Use only a select few pieces of key furniture, and keep plenty of open space.\\nWhen choosing furniture to place in a small room, look for pieces that have versatility. For example, use an ottoman in lieu of a sofa or chair. The ottoman not only provides seating but can also be used as a table, making use of the small amount of space you have. Using things that have two purposes could help you maximize a small space.\\nWhen you are decorating, keep the room’s purpose in mind. You should think about who may be present in the room and whether or not there is ample space. Keep family and friends in mind while designing your living-room, however focus on you and your mate when designing the bedroom.\\nWhen working on the room of a child, think of everything from a little kid’s perspective. Small children do not view their room in the same manner that you do. It’s important to use furniture and items that are made for a child’s height and easy to access with their small hands. Look at the things from the child’s point of view to avoid doing anything hazardous.\\nWallpaper only a portion of your wall to save money. It can be very expensive to redecorate your walls. Therefore, just put wallpaper on half the wall in order to save some money. Coordinate the wallpaper with a border that’s bold then choose a paint color for the rest of the wall. Your home will show a touch of class while your wallet takes less of a beating.\\nOnly half of the wall could be wallpapered. It can be very expensive to redo the walls. To save some money, apply wallpaper to half a wall only. If you put a border between wallpaper and paint it creates a interesting look. This can help you save money while maintaining the style that you desire.\\nDo not try to save money by choosing a lower-quality paint. Cheap paint not only wears away, but it can damage your walls and cost more in the end. Buy paint that will last in your rooms.\\nHave a style in mind when designing your rooms. Things should be attractive when you have company, but you are the one who will spend the most time in your home. Regardless of what others may think, do what makes you happy. If you find that you feel too bold, you can always make changes with time.\\nLighting is very important when you are thinking of remodeling a room. This is because lighting creates a certain mood. Kitchen and bathrooms require adequate lighting in order to function properly. In contrast, though, bright lighting can spoil the effect you’re shooting for if you want to make a room feel calmer and more subtle. Dimmer lights are great for bedrooms, living rooms and other rooms meant for relaxing.\\nMany people have smaller rooms that they wish appeared to be bigger. Apply a light colored coat of paint to make your smaller spaces seem larger. The general design rule is the darker the paint color, the smaller a room will appear.\\nBe open to painting options that do not only use solid colors. You can find some great tutorials online if you want some amazing designs. With a creative feel from these online tutorials you can figure out how to truly improve the interior of your home.\\nStep outside your comfort zone when painting an area of your house. You can find some great tutorials online if you want some amazing designs. Get creative when choosing wall paint designs to create a stunning look room.\\nIf you have the desire to increase the amount of light in a room, add mirrors so that they are across from your windows. As long as the mirror is big enough, it will reflect light back into the room, almost creating a second window. The room will appear brighter and lighter.\\nUpdating your home’s accessories is a great interior decorating tip. Change out accents and light fixtures in the room. Matching tea towels can create a personalized look to your living space too. Not every room will need major changes and you do not need to spend a lot of money.\\nWhen you are looking at brightening up a room with a fresh coat of paint, it is best to use white on your ceiling. Ceiling white is a specialized, high-gloss paint that reflects light well. When you use it, you will notice a huge difference in the room’s lighting.\\nIn the living room, all your furniture does not need to face the television. Placing chairs in a different part of the living room can be a great idea. You can sit down and relax with a friend while enjoying a cup of tea.\\nHow long do you want to live in your current home? If you plan on leaving before five years, you may want to stick to neutral designs. While you may appreciate the look of vivid purple carpeting, there’s a good chance that your tastes may not be shared by the next person.\\nFor a smaller space, a great trick for broadening the feel is to incorporate plenty of mirrors. Mirrors make a room appear larger than it is, which should help make the room look better. Try buying a mirror or two to use in your new design scheme.\\nBe careful of hanging newly acquired art too low or too high on your walls. Between 8 and 10 inches above your sofa is the ideal height for any art in your room.\\nEliminate clutter and over-sized furniture from small rooms. Consider obtaining good storage for the items that typically clutter your room. Put all of the miscellaneous toys and papers sitting around into storage. Bins and cabinets take up less space than clutter.\\nArrange storage boxes in your child’s playroom within his reach. This lets children keep their own space neat by storing and sorting their toys themselves. A well organized toy room can double as an office or a guest room.\\nWhenever you are repainting a room, use “ceiling white” to paint your ceiling. It’s a popular color that designers use to help reflect light to make a room look different than it really is. This will add drama to your room and make the ceiling appear higher.\\nLight colors like white or cream help to brighten and open up a room. This can do wonders for cramped quarters. Utilizing the right types of colors can add an instant sense of space.\\nGive some thought to traffic patterns in the living room as you place furniture in it. Your goal is to fit the furniture into the room and still give people enough room to move around. You want to avoid the occurrence of a traffic jam.\\nIf your bathroom features white tiled floors, opt for a bright, colorful shade for walls. You can use a bright green, bold blue, or a deep red to really accent the tiles. This gives the appearance of brighter looking tiles. You can also easily change it later if you want to.\\nIf you want to incorporate a green design in your bathroom, salvaged materials might be just what you are looking for. You can find materials from antique tiles to sinks that have all been recycled. A combination of recycled and new materials add an interesting design to your room. You can have a great looking room while saving money and being eco-friendly.\\nIf you have children in your home, you may want to consider using slip covers. Slip covers are very versatile, as you can match them to the colors of your furniture. You can even change the pattern with the seasons to make things more fun.\\nWhen working with a smaller space that has many different rooms, you should make the designs fit together seamlessly. Purchase bar stools that match your dining room set if the two rooms are together. So, when shopping for pieces of furniture in this situation you should try and get pieces that go well with both the dining and living area. Shopping for both spaces at once is a great idea. Try to find pieces that coordinate.\\nUse a ceiling paint that is two shades brighter when compared to the room walls. If you don’t, over time the entire room can start to feel much smaller than it is. Having bright ceilings will expand your room.\\nUse baskets to give your small bathroom more storage space. There are many different kinds of baskets that will suffice. Baskets can be used to hold magazines or bath towels. They can also be suspended from walls or placed beneath a vanity.\\nDecorating with light neutral tones of white and cream can help a small room seem airy and spacious. This can help improve the look of a smaller room that feels congested. Make sure to select a color that complements the design and available space in the room.\\nThink about how many people will be using a room when you are designing it. Is your social life small and intimate, or big and exciting? Remember, each room in your home needs to be approached differently, depending on the rooms needs. As you can see in your home, not all rooms are designed in the same way. With these ideas in mind, you can better design your home.\\nMake sure all sconces are strategically placed. Let the piece have its own personal space. It all depends on the size of the mirror, but step back and give it a good look before you doing any hanging.\\nA really good interior design tip is to always use consistency when decorating throughout a home. After all, there is a big difference between an eclectic style and one that is all over the board with little rhyme or reason. Knowing this difference can make or break the success of your projects.\\nYou don’t have to have overpriced professionals and tons of design magazines in order to do your interior planning. You can learn everything you need with a little research and some honest thinking about how you want to use your space. The preceding advice can get you started on the path to design.\\nA great interior design tip is to make sure your blinds and drapes go with the rest of your room. If your blinds do not match, they will stick out like a sore thumb and take away from your overall presentation. You also have to make sure they match other things in the room, such as the sofa or bed.\\nmattress and box spring encasements, however, they are not always aware of how to do so on their own. Luckily, you have found an article that has good information to get you started. It is up to you to apply the ideas you have reviewed.',\n",

       " 'Published on July 25th, 2019 | by Scott De Lacy\\nNight Call PC Review\\nSummary: Great for a single play-through, but no incentive to replay.\\nOne shot wonder\\nThere is a killer on the loose in Paris, and somehow you managed to get caught up in the middle of it. You, a simple taxi driver find yourself responsible for investigating and tracking down the killer, and must do so only by driving your cab and speaking with your passengers.\\nWell, it is a fresh take on this genre and as a concept, almost ground-breaking. The story starts with very little introduction to your character; you have a short prologue and learn you have been shot, waking up in hospital, having your life turned upside down, the events begin to unfold, whereby you are then tasked by the detective to start investigating the killer.\\nThe gameplay style is entirely in black and white and uses striking contrast shadows and shading in a pseudo comic book style of fixed foreground scenes with 2-3 point fixed character animations and moving non-descript background scenery of the road, that are triggered during different dialog. Most of the game takes place inside your taxi, and as you drive along you occasionally see transitional scenes of the taxi in 3rd person perspective, and scenes of the city of Paris. In true fashion and expectation, it is a very romantic theming that is wrapped in mystique and is at first very striking and complimentary to the game, which draws you into the story instantly.\\nSurprisingly the passengers are very diverse and each has their own character and biography. The dialog in the game is unique to each character and there is a sense of ‘finger on the pulse’ with each viewpoint and political perspective. This aspect of the game is actually quite well thought out and the characters really are interesting for the most part, but there are of course exceptions.\\nThe game play is really simple, you have to do your day job by driving the taxi during the night shift and earning enough fares to cover your fuel and bosses cut. Of course, you only have a limited time during your shift to earn money, gather information and interact with your passengers. The gameplay difficulty is based on the ability to earn money. Story mode makes it easier, where as you can make it near impossible to earn money. The catch of course is that if your bank balance goes to the negative, you will be fired and therefor can’t investigate the crime. Game over.\\nUnfortunately, the first few days of playing this game was next to impossible. There was constant freezing, black screens, unclickable areas, passengers that ended all choices in the game etc. After about 4-5 Steam client updates that were released over 3 days, the game became playable; but a few bugs still existed such as some passengers that caused an unrecoverable state of game play with absolutely no possibility to advance. Also the map showing the Taxi’s movements also failed constantly. Looks like Steam has again, blessed this game with additional ‘features’.\\nDespite this, there are 3 stories in the game, each with a different level of difficulty. I played the first one and I was impressed with the story. It was well written, very interesting and enjoyable. Then I started the 2nd story, and it included all of the early dialog of the first story. After 20 minutes of constantly clicking away the repetitive text that I have already experienced, including passenger dialog, I decided that was enough for me. Keeping in mind, that yes you can skip the dialog, but the story started the same, the dialog was the same, the passengers were the same, the antagonist was the same and it was the same interaction with your character.\\nThere is little doubt that at some point the story would offer some unique content; it was just too excruciating to continue playing to get to that point. It is sad, because the stories offered by the game are no doubt well written, but it feels like a bit of a cheat to offer 3 stories that utilise the same dialog, without so much as a twist or hook to recapture the audience.',\n",
       " 'MILAN – Massimo Bottura is one of the Ambassador Chefs of Expo 2015, an innovator of Italian cuisine of new generation. Invited to the conference organized by Gruppo Sanpellegrino on October 6, the five-star chef from Modena, owner of the famous Osteria Francescana di Modena, he spoke of the Made in Italy brand. A speech on the communication of the great values of our country, to export along with the sentiment of Italian entrepreneurs, especially those of the micro excellence sector.\\nIn order to promote the Made in Italy brand and disseminate it even more effectively, we must look at ourselves in the mirror and not lose ourselves in routine, in everyday problems, but look at it from a distance. At that point you get a defined and clear image of what Italy is and you can become an ambassador yourself of what represents the greatness of our country.\\nStarting from this assumption, what is Italy’s true problem? It is to be able to communicate in a truthful manner what exactly is its greatness, biodiversity, microclimate, and the strength of its diverse locations. For me Italy is all this, an incredible agriculture and food producer, ample coasts in the middle of the Mediterranean, mountains of the north rising above all the other European countries. Italy is the mist in the Padania plains which allows us, with a little poetry in our hearts, to see it as something essential for producing balsamic vinegar, for curing the culatello or seasoning Parmigiano Reggiano.\\nItalians must rediscover within themselves that sense of poetry that has always been in their DNA. Our entrepreneurs have always been great dreamers. Their enterprises, which, compared to French, American, Chinese or Japanese ones are “micro” enterprises, however, still express emotions. We have always been on the forefront of micro enterprises of excellence that have represented our strength and I believe this has been our strength and backbone: we have to start again from there.

It was declared as an independent district on 14th of November 1976. From then Ghaziabad has moved forward leaps and bounds on the social, economic, agriculture and individual front. The place was founded in 1740 by Ghazi-ud-din. He named it 'Ghaziuddinnagar'.\\nGeography of Ghaziabad District\\nGanga River and Yamuna River are the main rivers flowing through the district. Other than these there are some small rain fed rivers, prominent among them is Kali River. Apart from these rivers Ganga Canal flows through the district and irrigation work is carried out through different branches of Canal. The Ganga canal also caters to the drinking water needs of the people of Ghaziabad as well as Delhi. Climate of Ghaziabad District is quite similar to Delhi.

Almost 98% respondents said they went through the practice known as khatna or khafd, which involves cutting tip of the clitoris and is extremely painful.\\nAnother shocking thing which came out with this survey was that almost 74% were cut by untrained traditional cutters while 15% by trained professionals. Traditional cutters are mostly elderly women in the community who use a razor to cut the tip of clitoris, leaving young girls exposed to infections and excessive painful bleeding.\\nMost of the respondents were the residents of India and U.S. and belonged to 18 to 25 age group, and almost 76% of them were married.

The organisation is working towards ending the practice.\\nThe practice is so horrible that as many as 149 of 309 respondents said the practice left an emotional impact on their adult life. The survey also revealed popular beliefs behind why the practice is prevalent. A total of 56% believed it was carried out for religious purposes, 45% thought that it was to decrease sexual arousal, 42% felt that it was to maintain traditions, and 27% said it was to ensure hygiene and cleanliness.\\nA representative for the community, however, said the survey was not advertised in typical Bohra circles. “By excluding the overwhelming majority of the Bohras, the sample is skewed and unrepresentative. The opinions it has gathered are of people connected with the pollsters in one way or the other. It is, therefore, unsurprising that the survey says what Sahiyo wants to hear.”\\nThe World Health Organisation defines FGM as procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The WHO classifies FGM into four categories and the practice in India comes under the Type 1 and is termed as female genital cutting or circumcision.\\nType 1 is referred to as clitoridectomy, which involves partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals), and in rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris). The clitoral hood is made of erectile tissue and protects the glans.\",\n",

The news, of course, came as a surprise, but not only because she didn’t notice any pregnancy symptoms but because of the fact that her doctor had told her that she was menopausal and had ‘close to zero’ chances of getting pregnant.\\nShe also hadn’t had her period for a year, so she assumed that it was menopause since didn’t put on any extra weight or feel morning sickness. The only signs perhaps were back and abdomen aches.\\nAfter experiencing these symptoms for a while, Michele decided to take a pregnancy test and to everyone’s surprise, it came positive. Her family went through an emotional time after finding out that Michele was just a few weeks away from giving birth to a baby boy.\\n\"Everyone was in shock,\" Michele Hall told Naples Daily News. \"Definitely in shock,\" her husband agreed. \"It does make me feel young, though.\"\\n\"Not me,\" added Michele. \"I don\\'t feel so young right now.\"\\nThe couple decided to keep the child. But, due to Michele’s age, the birth was considered high risk and she underwent cesarean delivery. Michele and Jerry promised that this will be their last child and so the doctors removed her fallopian tube during the operation.\\nThey named the baby - Grayson and at first, he had some breathing problems but was soon sent home with his family.\\nWhile expressing her joy, Michele said that \"he is a blessing.\"',\n",

       " 'Some 77 years after it was first conceived, the North Spokane Corridor project takes the saying \"Slow and steady wins the race\" literally.\\n\"I\\'ve lived in Spokane for seven years now, and I\\'ve heard for a long time that \\'I\\'ll never see it — it will never be built while I\\'m alive,\\'\" says Joe McHale, spokesman for the Washington State Department of Transportation. \"One thing we really want to let people know is yes, you will.\"\\nConstruction on the project, which began in 2001 and is better known as the north-south freeway, is underway but faced a setback earlier this year when Gov. Jay Inlsee proposed delaying the project\\'s funding and pushing its completion to 2035.\\nBut this month, the Legislature approved House Bill 1125, which allocates another $169 million to the $1.5 billion project. The appropriations bill passed both the House and Senate last week.\\nOne reason behind Inslee\\'s recommendation to pull funding was a shortfall in the Connecting Washington account, which pays for several major projects including the North Spokane Corridor.\\n\"The funding shortfall is a result of gas tax revenues coming in lower than projected,\" says state Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig, D-Spokane. \"There is less money coming in from gas tax to pay for projects, as compared to the amount the Legislature expected to have when it programmed all of these improvements.\"\\nHowever, Billig says it was important to allocate the necessary funds to the North Spokane Corridor.\\n\"This is a project that\\'s already partially built, and we need to finish what we started,\" he says.\\nFROM 29 INTERSECTIONS TO NONE\\nState Sen. Marko Liias, D-Everett, says that currently the project will likely be finished by around 2030, which is the blink of an eye when it comes to infrastructure projects like this.\\n\"A project of this magnitude and complexity, and all of the environmental review and design that needs to take place and then having construction, it just takes time to get it all done,\" he says.\\nUltimately, the corridor will connect both U.S. Route 395 and U.S. Route 2 to I-90 near Freya Street. When complete, transportation officials say the new 10.5-mile freeway will reduce traffic on the Division Street corridor.\\n\"Part of the promise of the North Spokane Corridor is to take traffic, and particularly truck traffic, off of Division so that we can transform Division into a much more productive, effective and aesthetically pleasing corridor,\" says Billig.\\nAccording to Terrence Lynch, WSDOT\\'s North Spokane Corridor project engineer, the freeway will remove cars from Division and reduce congestion created by the major road\\'s 29 intersections, consequently reducing travel times and vehicle emissions caused by crawling traffic.\\n\"Our traffic modeling shows somewhere in the neighborhood of 65,000 vehicles or trips a day on the freeway, and that\\'s both directions once it\\'s completed,\" Lynch says. \"If you think about that many trips and taking those particular trips off of the local system, that\\'s a significant reduction.\"\\nFORCED TO DRIVE\\nMajor cities across the U.S. have spent trillions of dollars expanding highways and constructing new ones in an attempt to reduce traffic on major roads or freeways — with questionable results.\\nAt a 2018 meeting of American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Roger Millar, who leads WSDOT, said building and expanding highways to solve congestion \"isn\\'t the answer,\" and congestion \"is a problem we simply cannot solve.\"\\n\"We like to talk about traffic congestion as an issue, but it is actually a symptom of a larger problem — and the problem is we don\\'t provide affordable housing and transportation solutions,\" he said, according to the AASHTO Journal. \"We have a rich list of transportation options for the rich that can afford to live in our cities — the rest are forced to drive.\"\\nNot to mention the fact that these projects work temporarily, and the traffic and sluggish travel times tend to return shortly. This phenomenon is known as \"traffic generation\" by planners, and \"induced demand\" by economists.\\nAs Millar suggested, a better solution would be to fund transit or other non-automobile transportation.\\nAccording to Billig and Liias, $50 million in state funds have been added to the city\\'s transportation budget to transform the Division corridor and include bus rapid transit, bike and pedestrian facilities, and a variety of different amenities and housing options.\\n\"One of the really big benefits is that we are going to transform Division from what I think is a fairly problematic corridor into something that\\'s going to be really special,\" Billig says.\\nAnother component of the project is an effort originally led by Billig and Sandy Williams, publisher of the Black Lens newspaper who died in a plane crash last year, to determine how to use surplus property from the project in a way that gives back to the East Central community.\\n\"Had the project been built decades ago, I don\\'t have confidence that it would have been built with deep community engagement,\" says Liias. \"I was really impressed with the level of engagement with individual communities and engaging them in sort of what is your vision for the project, not just what is the most efficient engineering vision.\"\\nWhere the north-south freeway will eventually meet I-90 is currently the site of Camp Hope, a large homeless encampment. WSDOT is currently seeking feedback on designing a ramp there, where the north-south freeway\\'s \"skyway\" — a 60-foot-tall section of the highway that will stretch from Spokane Community College to I-90 — meets the interstate.\\n\"I actually got to get up on the deck of the new freeway; they were constructing it last summer,\" says Liias. \"It was pretty powerful to stand there and imagine what it\\'ll be like when it\\'s done in a few more years.\" ♦',\n",

       " 'Increased corn earworm migration risks continue through early next week as no less than two separate cold fronts are predicted to pose at least scattered to potentially widespread corn earworm migration flights. Flights have already been reported in the last week especially west of Lake Michigan, and these flights may continue to expand to the east into the Great Lakes region and eastern Midwest this weekend as a favorable weather pattern for migration is predicted with southerly winds and scattered to widespread precipitation ahead of the cold fronts. Moderate risks are in place tonight from northeast Missouri into far eastern Iowa, central and southern Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, northwest Ohio, and southern lower Michigan. Low risks extend east into Pennsylvania and southern Ontario, Canada. The first cold front is predicted to push east into the western Great Lakes region by Saturday, and with southerly winds originating over active corn earworm populations in the mid-south region, a High risk is being issued for southeast lower Michigan, northeast Indiana, northern Ohio, and southwest Ontario, Canada. The high risk has been shifted just a little bit to the east given a slightly faster than predicted cold frontal passage. Moderate risks extend back to I-57 in eastern Illinois and also north into central lower Michigan and as far east as northwest New York, southern Ontario, Canada and northwest Pennsylvania. Low risks are already back in the forecast across the Plains by tomorrow night as the next weather system organizes. By late in the weekend and early next week, Moderate risk ahead of the second cold front are in place from northeast Kansas, eastern Iowa, southeast Minnesota, and eastward into the southern Great Lakes region and eastern Midwest. The second front may produce additional flights, but coverage is not expected to be quite as high given the quick movement of the front and potential precipitation keeping moths less active closer or in mid-south and southern Midwest source regions by that time. Growers especially located in the upper Midwest where crops are still at susceptible stages to damage should be closely and regularly monitoring traps and field conditions as some intense moth flights have occurred in the last week and the potential continues for additional flights into early next week.',\n",
       " \"In case you aren't an avid golf fan, here's an update as to how former Northwestern Wildcat Matt Fitzpatrick has fared in the past year or so.\\nTo put it simply, he's killing it. He notched 10 top-10s on the European Tour in 2015 and picked up his first victory at the European Masters. All that strong play saw Fitzpatrick end the year in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings, which got him an invite to Augusta National. Fitzpatrick is currently ranked 43rd in the world.\\nThis will be Fitzpatrick's second Masters, as he played as an amateur in 2014 after qualifying for the tournament by winning the 2013 US Amateur. He missed a 10-foot putt for par that year to miss the cut.\\nFitzpatrick spent just one quarter at Northwestern before leaving school to pursue golf full time. He turned pro after the winning the low amateur medal at the 2014 US Open. Inside NU caught up with Fitzpatrick that year and discussed his decision to leave school.\\nFitzpatrick is paired with 2011 British Open winner Darren Clarke and 2014 FedEx Cup Champion Billy Horschel. They'll go off at 11:38 a.m. ET on Thursday and 8:42 a.m. on Friday.\\nHow to Watch\\nThe Masters is known for having some of the skimpiest TV coverage of any major sporting event.\\nESPN will have live TV coverage from 3-7:30 p.m. ET on both Thursday and Friday.\\nThose sites will also have coverage from holes 15 and 16 from 11:30 a.m.-7:30 p.m. ET.\\nFitzpatrick hasn't played his best golf of late. He was eliminated in the group stage of his last start, the WGC Dell Match Play, and has yet to pick up a top 10 on the season. But it's not his first time around Augusta, which is a sizable advantage; the course tempts players to take risks and first-timers typically struggle. Fitzpatrick has some experience and will have a game plan as to when he wants to attack and when he'll play it safe.\\nThat being said, don't expect too much from the young Brit. Augusta typically favors long hitters and many holes call for a left-to-right draw shape off the tee. Fitzpatrick doesn't hit it short by any means — he averaged 286 yards per drive on the European Tour last year — but his strength is his accuracy and his short game, and he prefers a fade off the tee. At least on paper, Augusta doesn't suit Fitzpatrick's game to a tee.\\nWith that being said, he's a quality, quality player. You don't get to the top 50 in the world at just 21 years of age by accident. And at the Masters, anything can happen. Don't be surprised if Fitzpatrick puts together two solid rounds and gives himself a chance to post a solid finish.\\nVegasinsider.com has Fitzpatrick at 250/1 to take home the green jacket.\",\n",
       " 'It’s no secret that subway tiles are hugely popular at the moment. In fact they have been for a while now but there’s no sign of this trend disappearing any time soon. We’ve been looking for some subway tile inspiration for our latest project, and thought we’d share some of our favourite styles to help with your next project.\\nThe Diverse Tile Style\\nPart of the enduring appeal of subway tiles is that they can work in virtually any setting, whether you’re looking for inspiration for a modern bathroom or a traditional kitchen, there’s a subway tile and grout combination to suit your project.\\nThis kitchen uses a basic white subway tile in an interesting way by tiling right up to the ceiling. Where your room is too small for wall units or lacks the head height, a couple of open shelves on a fully tiled wall can make an interesting feature in an otherwise potentially bare space.\\nIn a completely different setting, these gloss grey subway tiles prove their versatility by blending the divide between the modern wood effect on the upper wall with the traditional mosaic pattern on the floor of this bathroom. They really are suitable for any design scheme, even when that scheme involves both new and old elements.\\nIf you’re looking to make a bold statement with your kitchen or bathroom, then again subway tiles are ideal given the huge range of colours they come in. Take these bright red gloss tiles as an example. Matched against simple white kitchen cabinets they are a much more cost effective way of creating an interesting space than opting for more expensive cabinets. Add a few complimentary accessories and you can create a really impressive visual effect.\\nIf bright red isn’t your style, this bathroom shows a much more traditional look created with a fern green tile that adds a splash of colour and brightness to this en-suite without being overpowering. There seem to be two schools of thought in the investment market at the moment regarding colour. One is still stuck in the world of magnolia, whilst the other (particularly in the HMO world) is embracing bright feature walls. I find this middle ground a much more appealing look that will attract a much wider audience without being too garish.\\nWhite grout is the go-to answer for most tilers who aren’t told otherwise. Whilst it can create a bit of a boring result, when used in the right way the effect can be striking. Coupled with the grey subway tiles, the white grout pops out and makes the brick bond pattern in this bathroom really stand out. This is a great example of a contrast grout used without adding too much personal taste to a project.\\nFlipping the colours on their head can have an even more striking result, like in this example of a high gloss white tile alongside a really dark grey grout. In this case it adds to the traditional feel of the dark shaker cabinets but can equally work in a modern setting.\\nFinally, you can really push the boat out with virtually any coloured grout you can imagine. Most tile shops now offer a wide range of grout colours, with some specialists able to mix any colour you want. Whilst this particular example would suit a vibrant house share/HMO, I also think it would make a flip or single let aimed at young professionals really stand out in a boring, vanilla market.\\nIf you’re considering subway tiles but want to do something a little more creative with them, you can also look at changing the way they are laid. Typically laid in a straight horizontal or brick bond pattern, this can start to look a bit dull after a while. Simply rotating the tiles 90 degrees can completely transform the look, like in this minimalist bathroom. A horizontal pattern would look fairly traditional, whilst this vertical arrangement reminds me of something almost futuristic.\\nIf you’ve got a competent tiler you can trust then even more creative patterns can be trialled, like this herringbone style wall effect using subway tiles. The staggered edge along the top is so unusual and adds a really special feature to this kitchen that I haven’t seen before, particularly when you add dramatic contrast with the paint as well.\\nUsing Multiple Colours\\nYou might argue that black and white aren’t technically colours, but you know what I’m getting at! Combining two or more different subway tiles can add real interest, particularly if you plan on tiling full walls as it can help break up a room. This simple example uses a black stripe almost like a picture rail to add more character to a traditional style bathroom.\\nAt the other end of the spectrum you can really go to town and use a whole range of different colours to create a bright and energetic display, laid in a random pattern like this wall or used to create a large scale mosaic. When you start to combine different coloured tiles the options are endless, as long as you’re brave enough to create it.\\nWhether your investment strategy is single lets for families or HMOs for students, serviced accommodation for travellers or flips for high-earning professionals, subway tiles can be used in any setting to create an amazing effect in both kitchens and bathrooms.\\nHopefully we’ve given you some inspiration on how to use subway tiles in your next project, and we haven’t even mentioned using them on the floor yet… Follow us on Instagram for more interior design and property investment inspiration.',\n",

       " 'For Valentine’s Day, Talend published a fun infographic, “Use Big Data to Secure the Love of Your Customers.” It lists data quality as the second leading challenge with Big Data, but perhaps more striking is the $13.3 million annual financial impact caused by data quality problems.\\nI’m not entirely sure from the graphic which research group provided that stat, but a 2013 Gartner research paper put the cost higher, at $14.2 million a year.\\nActually, there’s no shortage of scary statistics and numbers on the high cost of bad data. For instance, this infographic by Lemonly.com and Software AG notes that bad data:\\n- May cost businesses as much 10-25 percent of an organization’s revenue each year. (Ovum Research puts it higher, at 30 percent of revenues, according to Informatica.)\\n- Costs the U.S. economy over $3 trillion a year.\\n- Adds up to $314 billion to health care costs.\\nNumbers like that are impressive, but perhaps overwhelmingly vague. What does it mean to say data quality “costs” an organization 10-30 percent of revenues? How is that determined? And will fixing it cost more?\\nA recent piece by Dell Boomi CTO Michael Morton puts some specifics to data quality’s cost by looking at how bad data changes a hypothetical direct mail marketing campaign.\\nIn his example, you’ll spend $20,000 each month on a campaign to “a highly targeted set of 100,000 customers in a specific market.” Even if you exclude employee time and operational costs, the mailing requires $240,000 for the year.\\nIn previous years, this mailing has generated revenue of about $500,000. So, you’re profiting $260,000 each year from sales.\\nHow does poor data quality change the equation? Morton assumes an error rate of 50 percent, which he notes is not uncommon for enterprise sales and marketing departments. That’s bad data in the form of duplicate entries, incorrect addresses, outdated lists and other errors.\\nBecause 50 percent of your mailings are lost, you’ve cut the revenue in half — making your profits for that program a mere $10,000. Add in employee time and other operational costs, and you’re most likely losing money, he adds.\\nSo, it’s easy to imagine how the average company could waste “$180,000 per year simply on direct mail that does not reach the intended recipient because of inaccurate data,” as Lemonly.com claims.\\nThat’s just looking at one small area, but it’s not hard to imagine how that might create problems with customer service, safety recalls or suppliers.\\nData quality can also add costs to IT systems such as Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and content management systems, according to a recent blog post by vendor Effectual Systems. The vendor estimates that these systems contain between 50-75 percent junk data. Fixing it manually can add up quickly, even if you’re only dealing with 1,000 changes a month. In their example, that can cost IT $600,000 and 12,000 man-hours per year.\\nIf you’d really like to pinpoint the cost of bad data at your own organization, Gartner’s Ted Friedman offers more specifics in this IT Business Edge interview, “How to Measure the Cost of Data Quality Problems.”\\nLoraine Lawson is a veteran technology reporter and blogger. She currently writes the Integration blog for IT Business Edge, which covers all aspects of integration technology, including data governance and best practices.

       " 'IBM Cuts Prices on Power 740 Storage and Smartie SSD and Servers\\nDecember 6, 2010 Timothy Prickett Morgan\\nIt looks like some customers are balking at the prices that IBM is trying to charge for storage chassis and a new solid state disk-PCI-Express RAID controller bundle that aims to boost the throughput of Power7-based machines.\\nJust before the Thanksgiving holiday and just after I had already went to press with the prior issue of The Four Hundred, IBM said in announcement letter 310-295 that it was cutting the price on the feature 1135 integrated storage controller by 13.3 percent. This device is not a storage controller, but rather a 2U chassis with two dozen 300 GB disks that supports IBM i 6.1 or 7.1, as well as AIX or Linux. (The chassis does have integrated RAID controllers.) The price on that chassis, which comes populated with the disks, is now $32,441, or $4.51 per GB. The price was also cut on the Smart Analytics System SV2 model for the same chassis, which is built from Power 740 server nodes and which runs a collection of InfoSphere Warehouse, Cognos, and SPSS software to do business analytics processing. The Smartie machines are clusters based on x64, Power, and mainframe servers.\\nSpeaking of the Smartie SV2 boxes, IBM also chopped the price of the PCI-RAID disk controller and solid state disk bundle used with this particular machine. I told you all about this bundle back in September, which pairs a PCI-Express 2.0 SAS controller with lots of bandwidth with four 177 GB SSDs made by SandForce for a total of 708 GB of storage and 120,000 I/Os per second of performance. IBM has a low-profile feature 2053 bundle for Power 710, 720, 730, and 740 servers that costs $20,654 and a regular-height version that costs $27,052. When IBM announced this back in September, knowing the costs were very high for SSDs, the company offered a package of that put together five of these controller/SSD bundles together for a 27.5 percent discount. Well, the Smartie box customers apparently said they wanted this price for onesies, and now IBM is selling single-units of these bundles on the Power 740-based Smartie SV2 clusters at the discounted price. That works out to $14,981 a pop, or $21.16 per GB, as you can see from this table:\\nYou’ve known me a long time now, so what I am going to say next? Right! If customers buying Smartie boxes are getting the deal on onesies of the RAID/SSD bundle, then all customers regardless of platform should be getting that price. And it shouldn’t matter if they are getting the low-profile version or the regular version–the price should be the same.\\nIBM also announced that the Power 740 server nodes used in the Smartie SV2 box, which have two processors with a total of 16 3.55 GHz Power7 cores activated and 128 GB of memory, had their prices slashed by a stunning 30.4 percent, from $72,828 to $50,708. So what am I going to say here? Right again! A Power 750 running IBM i 7.1 is a smart system too and it is a preconfigured box too, and that means if you acquire one using those very expensive eight-core Power7 chips spinning at 3.55 GHz, then you deserve a wonking 30.4 percent discount before the negotiations even start, too.',\n",

       " 'The journey of selling a home can be a rollercoaster of emotions and expectations. When your home remains on the market for an extended period without attracting offers, it can be frustrating. Here, we look into the main reasons why homes don’t sell and offer comprehensive solutions.\\n1. The Pitfalls of Overpricing Your Property\\nSetting the Right Price from the Start\\nOverpricing is, without question, the leading cause behind homes not selling. When a home enters the market with an inflated price tag, it immediately faces numerous challenges:\\n- Buyer Deterrence: A price significantly above the market average can deter potential buyers from even considering the property.\\n- Lack of Competitive Edge: In the real estate market, your property competes against others in its category. An overpriced home lacks the competitive edge necessary to stand out.\\n- Financing Hiccups: Even if a buyer agrees to the high asking price, financing issues may arise. Lenders often hesitate to approve mortgages for properties priced above their appraised value.\\nHow We Address Pricing Challenges\\nTo sidestep the pitfalls of overpricing, we leverage Comparative Market Analysis (CMA). This analytical tool helps us evaluate how your home compares to similar ones in the vicinity.\\nBy understanding the local market dynamics and the price points of recently sold homes, we position our offer for your property competitively.\\n2. Enhancing the Appeal of Your Home\\nFirst Impressions Matter\\nIn the property market, first impressions significantly influence buyer decisions. A well-maintained home resonates with potential buyers, signaling minimal future maintenance.\\nSimple Home Upgrades with Big Returns:\\n- Fresh Paint: A fresh coat of paint rejuvenates a home’s interior and exterior, offering a clean slate to prospective buyers.\\n- Flooring: Flooring impacts the overall aesthetic of a space. Ensure all flooring, whether carpet, hardwood, or tile, is in prime condition. If it’s worn out, consider a refurbishment or replacement.\\nBuyer’s Perspective: Ready to Move In\\nWhen buyers view a home, they envision their future in it. Properties that appear move-in ready are often more enticing. By ensuring all repairs are done, and the home looks presentable, we increase the likelihood of capturing buyer interest.\\n3. Energizing Your Marketing Strategy\\nIn the digital age, a dynamic marketing strategy is pivotal. Traditional methods like yard signs and MLS listings, though foundational, are no longer enough.\\nStrengthening Digital Presence:\\n- Online Listings: We ensure your property is prominently featured across prominent real estate platforms and websites.\\n- Interactive Tours: Incorporating virtual and 3D tours allow potential buyers to experience the property from the comfort of their homes.\\n- Engaging Content: High-quality photos and engaging descriptions provide a comprehensive view of your property, attracting more potential buyers.\\n4. Ensuring Seamless Property Access\\nBoosting Home Showings through Accessibility\\nAccessibility is critical. When real estate agents have easy access to your property, it increases the chances of frequent, even spur-of-the-moment showings.\\n- Lockboxes: These secure devices store your home’s key, allowing verified agents to access and show your property even in your absence. Homes with lockboxes often receive more viewings.\\n- Flexible Viewing Hours: Broadening the time slots for property viewings can accommodate a larger pool of potential buyers.\\nSelling a home is a strategic process that requires meticulous planning and execution. We at Iwillbuyyourhouseforcash.com are dedicated to providing tailored solutions, ensuring your property stands out in the market and attracts the right buyers.\\nWith our expertise and commitment, we aim to facilitate a swift and profitable sale for your home.

       " \"Jesca Hoop - Order of Romance\\nJesca Hoop returns with her sixth album, Order of Romance, a record that fortifies her position as one of the most striking and original voices in contemporary music. Order of Romance is Hoop's most intricate and finely balanced album to date, one that draws on classic song writing, recalling anything from Gershwin to Paul Simon, but creating something that is unmistakably, indelibly Jesca Hoop. It is a deep dive into craft.\\nIn the summer of 2021, Hoop once again ventured south from her adopted home of Manchester to Bristol to team up with producer John Parish (PJ Harvey, Aldous Harding), her collaborator for 2019’s Stonechild. This time additional assistance came from in Jess Vernon (This is the Kit) to arrange for a four-piece horn and woodwind quintet. Legendary drummer Seb Rochford lent his skills, John Thorne plays the bass and Chloe Foy and Rachel Rimmer were enlisted to deliver Hoop’s signature vocal arrangements. The result is a fruitful marriage of song craft and arrangement, brimming with a cinematic charm and lyrical wit that signify a new chapter full of new life for an artist who knows her mind, her heart and voice well enough to trust them in uncharted territory.\\nOrder of Romance then is a complete work that demands close attention, an active listen, a filagree that’s apparent lightness of touch belies a serious intent. Themes of empathy and friendship, intertwine with a clear eyed and moralistic poetry on subjects such as gun control, religious and political cults, and climate change.\\nOrder of Romance is perhaps ultimately an exploration of the endless balance act of being a ‘Human Being’, an approach and examination of some of the biggest theme and issues of our time through the doorway of the personal, a way finding meaning and some kind of faith in a world where so much is disconnected and discordant.\",\n",

Gastric carcinoma is fourth most common tumor in the world accounting for 11%. AIM To determine the occurrence of gastric tumors and its correlation with variables like age, gender distribution and anatomical site in a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a descriptive study of gastric tumors which included all gastric Biopsies/specimens diagnosed on histopathology from May 2009 to May 2013. RESULTS Total 65 gastric tumours were observed, representing 6.22% of all tumours during study period. Out of these, 60 cases were malignant and 5 cases were benign. Benign cases constitute around 1.01% of all benign tumours and commonest being hyperplastic polyps. In malignant tumours all cases were adenocarcinoma except one case of gastric Carcinoid and lymphoma. Gastric tumours showed a peak incidence in the 7 th decade of life. Mean age at presentation was 62.2 years in males and 46.6 years in females. The male to female was 1.6:1. Gastric antrum was the commonest site of presentation of the lesion. Tubular variant of adenocarcinoma is the commonest with 76.7% followed by mucinous adenocarcinoma. Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and stage II carcinomas was commonly observed in our study. CONCLUSION Malignant gastric tumors were more common than benign tumors. Adenocarcinoma–tubular type was the most common malignancy, with pyloric antrum being the commonest site.

       " 'You never know how precious life is, or how much you take it for granted, until you are faced with a life-threatening situation. We took a family trip to Hershey, where we planned to go on wild rollercoasters (and my favorite chocolate-making ride) at Hershey Park, checking out the Amish country and fun factories in Lancaster and hitting up our favorite “family” buffet—just like we had done before and loved. But this time, life took an unexpected turn of events.\\nIt was a trip that we will all remember vividly for the rest out our lives.\\nWe arrived in Hershey and checked into our hotel. We decided that after the long drive, we would hit up the park the next day, but we still wanted to do something since we were all so excited to be there. We had seen a sign for the Indian Echo Caverns, so my parents thought they would be really cool to explore and check out. So we went, and after being in intense heat all day, the cold dampness of the caverns was a shock to all of our systems. It was a boring exploration, and we were freezing. None of us enjoyed\\nit, and we couldn’t wait to get out and just get back to the hotel to rest up for our much more exciting adventure to come.\\nWe were all snuggled up and ready for bed, and my sisters and I were already sleeping. All of a sudden, we heard a blood-curdling scream: my mother saw my youngest sister having a seizure. None of us knew what to do, and we were all petrified that she was going to die. My mother was panicked and paralyzed with fear. At the time, we didn’t know that you were supposed to let a seizure run its course, and to just put her in a safe place until it stopped. My sister finally stopped seizing, but then was burning up with a fever. My dad immediately drew a bath to cool her down, while my other sister and I were told to go get help.\\nI will never forget the two of us running out in our nightgowns, banging on doors for help, trying to get the elevator to quickly go down to the front desk to call an ambulance for our little sister. We were so, so scared. As the oldest, I tried to be calm and brave as best as I could, but even I was in a state of shock over what was happening. The people at the front desk were nice but slow, and I remember somehow finding the clarity to tell them to get an ambulance fast and explained what happened.\\nIt was then that I (and my family) realized that I’m the one you can always count on to keep calm, take action and be the supportive rock to lean on in a crisis situation.\\nA tough responsibility for someone to take on for the rest of her life, but it just became part of who I was from that point on.\\nWe returned to the room after getting help, waiting for what felt like hours. My mother was at a loss of what to do, just cradling my sister in her arms. My dad was this pillar of strength trying to hold it all together, but I could see how truly scared he was too. We finally got her to the hospital, where I remember having to stay alone in the waiting room with my other sister, holding her tight as we both cried. We had no idea if our sister was even okay. There were some nice nurses and administrators that sat with us and tried to keep us calm. But it wasn’t until we saw our parents and heard everything was okay that we could breathe a sigh of relief.\\nIt had to be the longest night of our entire lives. Thankfully, my sister was fine. They broke her fever and she was allowed to go home with us that night. But it didn’t stop us from worrying if it would happen again. Luckily, our grandparents had their summer camp trailer in Pennsylvania, not too far from where we were, so we went and stayed with them for a few days. As a mother who witnessed her own baby take a seizure once, I can understand now why we would go there instead of straight home. My poor mother (and father) were so scared about it happening again, that they needed the security of my grandparents until we all felt better that she wouldn’t have another seizure. None of us could relax and enjoy ourselves. But what we did do was come together even closer as a family, and realize how much we loved each other.\\nFor me, I could have lost my sister.\\nFlashing through my young brain was how mean I was to her sometimes, or how I would\\nrefuse to play with her because she was an “annoying little sister.” There is something about seeing your sister’s eyes roll to the back of her head and then her body go lifeless that makes you realize, it’s not that important if she wants to play with your favorite Barbie doll—what’s important is that she is alive to play with it.\\nA sister is a gift—two of them is a blessing.

The room had no door and was damp, muddy, and filled with swarms of mosquitoes. They lived in extreme poverty and discomfort, with no privacy. Though they never discussed it, pangs of hunger tormented them. Once, they did not taste a piece of bread for an entire month.\\nWith World War II ravaging Europe, many refugees and displaced people ended up in the region where Rabbi Levi Yitzchak had been exiled. Rabbi Levi Yitzchak soon became well known among the Jewish refugees. Large groups of men and women, especially those women whose husbands were taken away for the war effort, would visit the esteemed rabbi and his wife, seeking counsel on various matters.\\nWith meager resources at their disposal, and facing a constant threat to their very lives, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak and Rebbetzin Chana heroically reached out to their brethren in need, helping in every way, materially and spiritually.\\nIn 1944, as Rabbi Levi Yitzchak’s sentence was nearing its end, his physical condition began to deteriorate. A serious illness was severely weakening him. Meanwhile, friends in nearby Alma Ata resolved to secure the rabbi’s release. They contributed thousands of rubles, giving of most of their wealth, to acquire proper permits for his relocation. After six weeks fraught with setbacks and obstacles, they were finally able to obtain the release documents. Immediately after Pesach, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak and Rebbetzin Chana left Chi’ili and arrived in Alma Ata. In this large city, their living conditions improved and they worked more vigorously to help others in need. Yet through the summer the Rabbi’s illness grew worse. A young friend made a special trip from Leningrad to Alma Ata, together with a well-known doctor. The doctor did not have a good prognosis for the rabbi.\\nRabbi Levi Yitzchak and Rebbetzin Chana endured those heartbreaking days with exceptional strength and fortitude. Despite the dire conditions, they continued to welcome any depressed or broken person into their home, attending to his or her specific needs and providing food when necessary.\\nOn the 20th of Av, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok’s condition turned critical. Although he was no longer able to speak, he continued to murmur words of Torah or Psalms. That evening, Rebbetzin Chana took a short rest so that she would have the strength to continue caring for him; when she awoke, she found the house filled with people. Her husband had returned his pure soul to its Maker.\\nDuring his years as Rabbi of Yekatrinoslav, as well as while in exile in Chi’ili, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak wrote thousands of manuscripts of Torah encompassing and intertwining, in his unique style, Talmud, halacha, Kabbalah, and Chassidus.\\nUnfortunately, most of these manuscripts were destroyed by the Communists and the Nazis. However, when Rebbetzin Chana escaped Russia in 1947, she managed to smuggle out some of the manuscripts that Rabbi Levi Yitzchak had written during his years of exile.\\nAt the behest of the Rebbe, these manuscripts were published in a five-volume set under the title Likutei Levi Yitzchak.

       " 'Kawa Akrawi – Director\\nKawa Akrawi is a Kurdish filmmaker who has been committed to documenting social justice issues through film since 1995. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Kawa co-produced and directed two powerful documentaries, \"Saddam\\'s Mass Grave\" and \"Chemical Ali\", which were filmed during his extensive travels through Iraq. \"Saddam\\'s Mass Grave\" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, earning critical acclaim for its raw and unflinching portrayal of the horrors committed by the Baath regime.\\nKawa\\'s more recent documentaries, including \"Kuljo: My Heart is Bleeding\" and \"One Yazidi Family vs ISIS,\" have been broadcast worldwide on BBC World and Al Jazeera. As a field director and D.O.P, Kawa brings his unique perspective and empathy to these projects, capturing the struggles and resilience of marginalised communities in Iraq with great sensitivity and depth.\\nGulan Akrawi – Producer\\nGulan is a Kurdish journalist and TV producer with a remarkable career in promoting Kurdish culture and media. She gained recognition as the head of the cultural center HYS in Turkey, where she worked for many years before moving to Belgium to work at the Kurdish TV station STV, where she now serves as the head of broadcast. For over a decade, she has collaborated with filmmaker Kawa Akrawi on several documentary projects that highlight the experiences of the Kurdish people. These projects cover a broad range of topics such as Kurdish history, politics, and culture.\\nMaking The FilmAfter completing a film about a Yazidi family fleeing from ISIS massacres in Iraq in 2014, I felt a strong urge to investigate the roots of ISIS and understand the reason behind this Islamic jihadi group\\'s hatred towards humanity. This journey took me to Rojava, a region in Northeastern Syria, where I visited the areas ISIS controlled and talked with detained ISIS fighters, their families and the local people. Here I realised that the ideology of this horrific movement is still alive and that this terror group was not operating alone.\\nDespite facing numerous challenges and constantly moving for security reasons, we were determined to shed light on the critical situation in Syria through this film. I want the viewers to see what is happening here and why they should be concerned about a region that may seem far from their doorsteps. For example, one particular scene that stood out during our filming was our visit to the Al Hol camp, where we witnessed the devastating effects of the conflict on innocent children. We were disturbed to hear children of European parents singing Islamist fight songs that glorified death and violence. It was a stark reminder of the far-reaching impact of the conflict in Syria and the urgent need for international co-operation to find a solution.\\nCrucially, many people abroad may not be aware of the extent of Turkish intervention in the region. Turkish military drones are active in the sky of Northeastern Syria, and they are not targeting the Islamic jihadi terror fighters but rather innocent civilians and vital infrastructure.\\nThe situation in Syria is complex and volatile, and it is essential to understand the roots of the conflict and the various actors involved. Through this film, we aimed to provide a platform for the voices of those affected by the conflict and to encourage Western countries to engage in finding a solution.\\n– Kawa Akrawi, Director',\n",
       " \"“Don’t worry, your time is coming…keep praying, keep preparing, keep planning.” These words stood out to me as I half-heartingly scrolled through the plethora of emails in my inbox. I read the words a few times, hoping they would be infused into my spirit and mind, as there seems to be a continual raging war between those two things within me as of late.\\nWhen the season is daunting and you want to give up, or in my case, want to ignore the vision that lacks recent confirmation. God allows something as simple as a few words to show up in my inbox to penetrate the dormancy of the vision as a reminder to keep going, and a nudge to keep hope alive. My faith challenges me to believe it’s a love tap from the Lord that lets me know He’s not finished yet, so I shouldn’t be either.\\nKeep praying. The Bible has a lot to say about prayer. So, with confidence, you can be assured that praying is the preferred method of the Lord for us to reach Him. Prayer is the means that enlightens us to understand His ways and His Word. With that, I want to focus on prayers that were answered in the Bible. From the beginning of creation prayer has been in existence. Imagine, the vastness of God that He hears the prayers of His people. WOW! We can reach the Father’s ear and He is kind enough to reply to our words or tears. Yes, tears are wordless prayers.\\nIn the Bible, we read of testimonies of answered prayers. In 2 Kings 20:1-6, Hezekiah was very sick, and the prophet Isaiah came to tell him, “Dude, with all due respect, you’re not gonna make it out of this sickness.” The King prayed by turning his face to the wall and reminding God of their relationship and how he was with him from the time of his youth. He asked God for additional life. God answered his prayer and gave Hezekiah another 15 years of life.\\n1 Samuel 1 gives us another answered prayer testimony. This time, it was Hannah who was in despair and needed hope. She was childless and her “sister wife” wasn’t. Apparently, the other wife seemed to find great pleasure in rubbing Hannah’s empty womb in her face. Yet, Hannah continued to be faithful to the Lord be going up to the house of the Lord yearly. Fast forward, God heard her tears and answered her prayers to have a child. God is a prayer answering God! Always keep praying.\\nIf you’re vision isn’t happening, it appears your prayers aren’t being answered, and your faith is wobbly, keep praying. I'd like to share with you that I think praying puts you in a position for God to answer your needs, desires, dreams and so much more. So keep praying.\\nBack to the original email that sparked this blog. It read keep praying and keep preparing. I take this to encourage and instruct me in the middle of the nothingness, I’m not to get lazy and do nothing. In the “it’s not happening” of the vision, that’s when you prepare even more than if something was happening. Think about it, when things do start happening, you won’t have time to prepare, and you’ll be unprepared. So, thank God for the time to prepare. It’s difficult and counterculture to prepare for something when nothing is happening. But that’s faith in action!\\nIt's in the no movement that you’ll need to be creative and innovative in your preparing to stay motivated in your preparing. But preparing yourself will benefit you when it’s time! Being prepared allows you to fully engage in the arrival and ride of the wave when it happens.\\nThe third directive listed in the email to keep your vision and passion alive is to keep planning. Planning is different from preparing. Preparing is conditioning so that you are ready. Planning is action. What you will do when it happens, what’s next, step by step. Your preparation will impact your plan and vice versa. While these two things are distantly related, they are unique in their impact.\\nThis last directive is one that I added to help myself. Keep pressing! Pressing is left up to one’s own interpretation and one’s own capacity. My most committed pressing might be mild in your scope of pressing or vice versa. So, figure out how you press and to what capacity in your own life.\\nPressing denotes consistent work and effort. Press on! Keep going! Keep the work moving. In Luke 8 and in Mark 5, we read of the woman who kept pressing. She had a debilitating condition and she heard about Dr Jesus! Due to the culture of that time, her condition hindered her from having a normal life. Despite, she pressed! She pressed through the crowd to get to Jesus. Not even to see Jesus’ face but to get close to his feet, specifically the hem of his clothing. Her pressing involved groundwork. She pressed until she got behind Jesus in the crowd confident that her contact with Him would be all she needed. Jesus answered her prayer. Her pressing paid off. Interestingly, I don’t know her name, as she was only referred to as the woman with the issue of blood, but she pressed, and Jesus answered her prayers.\\nToday, keep praying. Today, keep preparing. Today, keep planning. Today, keep pressing. Just for today. Then if the Lord wakes you up tomorrow, repeat until it’s your glory time and you are seeing Jesus, face to face!\\nJeremiah 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\",\n",

       " 'The colors selected by the artists had a direct bearing on the characters portrayed. According to ancient texts, there are three broad qualities assigned to superhuman, human, and sub-human beings, viz. Satva (the noblest), Rajas (the active and middle principle) and Tamas (the dark and destructive principle) respectively.\\nTo represent Satvic quality, green and shades of green were used. Characters of the Rajasic quality were portrayed in red or golden, and the Tamasic nature of the gods were represented not by black but in white, while demons and demonesses were represented by black.\\nAmong the subjects, Vishnu and his Satvic incarnations, Parvati, Sridevi, Arjuna, pious beings like Prahlada and Markandeya were always painted in green. Bhoodevi (Goddess Earth), Ganga, Ganesa, and the four-headed Brahma were [typically] painted in red. Vishnu was [also] painted in different colors according to his attributes.\\nIt is true that the figures of the murals have the external likeness of men and women; but the divine, or the supra-human aspect is also obvious in [virtually] every detail. The creators of these pictures had no doubt undergone rigorous mental disciplines, or sadhana.\\nThey had the creative skill to fill every available space with as many details as possible, and also the skill to pinpoint one or two essential details and leave the rest to our imagination. The painting in the Mattancherry palace of Krishna holding the Govardhana aloft for example, is a typical example in which minute details of the wooded mountain are elaborately depicted. This tendency to detailed elaboration is also a characteristic feature of the Koodiyattom, the ancient temple theatre of Kerala. Another later, but frequent characteristic of the murals of Kerala are the beaded or decorative outlines, not only around each panel but also around individual figures.\\nDuring the 15th and the 16th centuries, when the Bhakti movement swept through Kerala, many were the excellent murals that were painted. It is also highly probable that the leading names of the movement like the eighteen and a half poets of the Zamorins court, Ezhutachan, Melpathoor, Poonthanam, and the venerable sage Vilvamangalam could have been instrumental in reviving this popular tradition of religious art.\\nThe decay of this tradition that started in the late 18th century, gained momentum with the Mysore invasion of Malabar (1766-82) and the take-over of the Travancore temple trusts by the then British Resident (1811). The final blow came when the portrait style of painting of Raja Ravi Varma (1848 1906) gained fame and popularity.',\n",

       " 'Have you recently had a new furnace set up and are now having an unusual smell? You’re not alone, because plenty of other homeowners also have this happen at first. Let’s review what’s leading to this smell, and when you can anticipate it to go away, as well as three other furnace smells you shouldn’t disregard.\\nWhy Your New Furnace Smells\\nThere are two explanations why a new furnace might reek.\\nYour furnace has a special coating on certain parts to keep them from rusting. This may include the heat exchanger, which safely removes gases such as carbon monoxide naturally created during the heating process.\\nWhen your furnace operates for the first couple of times, the coating may release a burning smell. This is normal and the smell should dissipate the more your furnace heats.\\nTo be on the safe side, you’ll want to call a heating and cooling company if the smell lingers. A burning smell that lingers can mean the motor is too hot or there’s an electrical problem, among other issues.\\nDust accumulates inside your furnace when it’s idle in warm weather. That dust will burn off when you turn on your furnace in the fall, producing a burning smell. This smell should go away within a few minutes.\\nOne way you can reduce or prevent this smell is by having furnace maintenance done every single year. This is necessary to keep your valuable manufacturer’s warranty valid, plus it keeps your furnace clean and ensures it will run smoothly during the upcoming heating season.\\n3 Other Furnace Smells You Shouldn’t Disregard\\nWhile it’s less common for a new system to need furnace repair, it happens. Here are three other odors you should keep an eye out for and what they might mean.\\n- Burning plastic or rubber. If your furnace smells like burning plastic, you might have an electrical difficulties. Electrical wiring is coated in plastic to avoid shocks, and this smell is a signal that heat is melting this precautionary coating. To prevent a fire, turn off your furnace as soon as possible and have it checked out by an HVAC technician.\\n- Gas or rotten eggs. Gas companies include sulfur in natural gas to signal you when there’s a leakage. If your furnace smells like gas or rotten eggs, shut it off right away, leave your home and call 911. Exposure to natural gas can make you ill, plus it’s highly flammable and explosive.\\n- Musty. If your furnace smells musty, you might have mold and mildew developing in your ductwork. We advise having your ductwork inspected and cleaned if necessary.\\nNow that you understand which furnace smells are normal and which ones aren’t, you’re well-equipped to take care of your new heating system. If you’re worried about an odd odor, our Kirkfield Heating & Air Conditioning HVAC technicians can assist you. Give us a call at 204-272-8128 to schedule your appointment now.

Whether it’s swimming laps to get your fitness levels up, teaching your little ones how to swim or floating around with a beer in your hand, pools can offer up a great reprieve from the infamous Aussie summer.\\nIt’s no secret that pools also take time, money and effort to maintain. Sometimes, it can start to feel like more effort than it’s worth, especially if you and your family aren’t getting as much use out of it as you’d like. If you’re looking to spruce up your poolside area and get the most out of your investment, there are a few tricks you can pull to make it more inviting and fun than ever. Here are 5 ways you can enhance your poolside for the summertime and make it fun again for the whole family.\\n- Upgrade your poolside furniture\\nLots of people are hesitant to invest in poolside furniture, worried that it’ll quickly deteriorate and become weathered over time. While this is true in some cases, there are several high-quality options out there that require minimal maintenance and are built to withstand the elements.\\nTeak outdoor furniture is a popular choice for these very reasons, being resistant to the effects of rain, sunlight, storms, pests and mould and mildew. Its impressive strength and durability make it an ideal addition to any poolside area, and it’s built to last whatever our wild weather throws at it.\\n- Add lights to your pool\\nWe all love using our pools during the day, but why not get the most out of it at night, too? Adding LED lights in your pool is a great way to keep things safe for a late-night swim, illuminating your pool and the surrounding garden at a low cost.\\nThis can also add an exciting visual element to your pool at night, with the option to install light with different colours, patterns and brightness for the ultimate experience that enhances your pool’s beauty.\\n- Add greenery to your poolside area\\nAdding greenery around your pool can help give it a tropical and tranquil feeling, giving the feeling of the ultimate staycation and your own little paradise in your backyard. Whether it’s a vertical garden running alongside the edge of your pool or even just potted plants on the poolside can go a long way with minimal effort involved.\\nJust make sure to get plants that can survive the harsher conditions that come with being poolside, like the direct sunlight and reflection off the water. Frangipanis, star jasmines and agave attenuates are all solid options that will add some flair and excitement to your poolside with minimal TLC.\\n- Make it multi-purpose\\nAnother way to get some more use out of your pool is to make it multi-purpose. Something like a meditation spot or a picnic area can be a fantastic way to utilise the relaxation that a pool can offer, even if the weather’s not warm enough for a dip.\\nIf you have the space, you can even create space for home workouts by your poolside. This allows you to get some fresh air and open space while you exercise, rather than trying to awkwardly do your workout in your bedroom or living area.\\n- Ensure routine cleaning\\nIt may not be much fun, but the proper care and maintenance of your pool will go a long way in getting as much use out of it as possible. Getting in the habit of routinely testing the water and adding chemicals as necessary, checking and cleaning out the filter, vacuuming the bottom of the pool and keeping the pump running are all essential factors in keeping it clean and safe.\\nIn terms of the poolside area, regularly sweeping, maintaining the greenery and keeping the pool fence clean are also relatively quick and easy tasks you can do to keep everything looking in top shape.',\n",

As someone who struggles with anxiety and depression — a combo that is less than ideal for a journalist or a game master juggling seven different players in a six-hour Dungeons & Dragons game — it can be tough to break into a game that’s all about socializing, so I want to untangle this question with my experience from a different angle.\\nIn this week’s column of Tabletop tips from an anxious GM (all of which can be found on our DND tips hub), I’ll be answering a question that has been posed by friend and colleague John Loeffler. He writes, “What would you tell someone who hasn't played TTRPGs but wants to go about doing so? Both from a player and a DM/GM perspective?”\\nGetting into TTRPGs may seem like a daunting task, but it’s really not. It’s like any other game except you get to actually roleplay your own character. Some TTRPGs, like D&D 5e, can be a bit rules-crunchy, so that’s intimidating to some, but here are a few ways you can jump into D&D or any TTRPG with no experience whatsoever.\\nFind some friends, do your research, and buy supplies. Once you get all of that done, then you just need to find a platform to meet (physically or virtually) and schedule your game. Finally, decide who’s going to be the GM, figure out the rules together, create your characters, and then just play the game.\\nYou don’t need to know all of the rules in the book to have a good time, just be open-minded and accommodating to everyone. Most importantly, make sure you set boundaries and limits between the players to ensure that no one does anything to trigger anyone else. The last thing you want is a party member causing trouble for the group and ruining the fun. If someone isn’t willing to respect the boundaries in place, they don’t belong at your gaming table.\\nHow to start playing TTRPGs — An in-depth look\\nFind some friends. If you have people to play with already, skip this graph. Otherwise, you’re going to need to do some hunting. If you’re looking to play D&D specifically, I recommend hopping on D&D Beyond and either posting on the forums or looking for open forums requesting new players. You could also look for groups using Roll20’s LFG system, which is a virtual tabletop as well as a group finder, and you’ll find more TTRPGs on there as well. Join a Discord server — there’s one for almost every hobby, and you can meet friends or find an active game through there. You can find people in the Foundry VTT server, Astral TableTop server, or D&D Beyond server. This may be anxiety-provoking, and trust me I totally understand, but you have to put yourself out there if you don’t have anyone to play with. If you don’t like the first person you meet, move on to the next one. TTRPGs are popular with a broad spectrum of people and you’ll find a group that’s a perfect fit for you.\\nDo your research. The best way to learn how to play a TTRPG is by watching other people play it. There are some great shows that revolve around D&D, like Critical Role or Dimension 20. If you’re interested in Call of Cthulhu, Good Time Society did a one-shot that’ll give you an idea of how to play. You can even find a series on Vampire: The Masquerade that Geek & Sundry did. No matter which TTRPG you want to play, there’s bound to be someone that’s played it, so invest some time in getting a feel for how it plays. It also doesn’t hurt to watch shorter videos to give you a breakdown on the rules. Go to YouTube first before spending your own money on something you might not like — not every TTRPG is for everyone. Keep in mind the people on these shows are often professional performers, don’t use them as a yardstick for your own GMing or play, but use them to get an overall feel for the game.\\nBuy supplies. Once you know which TTRPG you want to play and if you like how it runs with other people, it’s time to buy some supplies. Don’t go all out. Just get the bare minimum. If you’re looking to get into D&D, I recommend purchasing an Essentials kit (physical or digital depending on where you’re playing), as it’ll give you basic rules, some dice, an adventure to play, and a bunch of handouts to make the game easier to understand. There’s also a Call of Cthulhu starter set if you want to dive into cosmic horror. Just keep an eye out for the recommended supplies in the videos you watch during your research phase.\\nFind a platform. The best thing about TTRPGs is that they can be played anywhere at almost any time because it’s all in your imagination. All you have to do is pick a spot that’s most convenient to you and your group, whether it’s in a Discord server on Saturday nights or Wednesday mornings in the comfort of your own home. If it’s in-person, you can find a bunch of neat tools for your specific TTRPG, including miniatures, maps, and dice. However, if it’s virtual, you might want to take a look at our best virtual tabletop software to see what’s right for your group.\\nSchedule. You can use scheduling tools, such as WhenisGood to quickly take a poll for what works best for people. Also, be transparent about how long the game will last — typically my D&D sessions run anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. Make sure you build in breaks so people don’t get too tired.\\nDecide the GM. If you want to be the game master of your group, you’re going to have to put in a lot more effort in understanding the rules, making narrative decisions, and keeping up clever pacing to make everything run smoothly. Don’t worry, everyone is rough when they first start out. But you’ll have to do a little more research, and ultimately, practice makes perfect. Research will only get you so far until you figure out your own style of GMing. You can take a look at our piece on ‘how do I engage my players’ to get a better idea of worldbuilding and storytelling.\\nFigure it out together. Once you’ve all gathered together, run what TTRPGers like to call a “Session 0.” Since this is your first time, it’ll be a little rough around the edges, but this is where you and everyone else figure everything out together, from making your characters and story to worldbuilding and setting structure. Everyone, including the GM, needs to be comfortable with every decision going forward, so make sure you communicate with each other. This is the best time to set expectations and limits.\\nJust play. You don’t need to know every rule in the book, and you don’t need to be right about every ruling as a GM or even a player. Once you think you’ve got all of your players ready with characters they like, just go for it. TTRPGs are a constant learning experience. Even after years of playing D&D, I’m learning new things every day. I just learned that you can’t concentrate on a spell if you’re readying another spell as a reaction because it’s considered concentration, and you can’t concentrate on two things at once. As long as everyone at the table is having fun (including the GM), then the rules come second. And if there’s a rule in the book that seems dumb, throw it out — you don’t have to listen to everything. Just make sure the peace is maintained between your group — setting personal ground rules is a must, and those should never be crossed.\\nI hope this helps new players and GMs out there who are just jumping into TTRPGs.

       " 'Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw will start NLCS Game 4 against Braves\\nDodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw, scratched from his scheduled Game 2 start because of back spasms, will start Game 4 against the Atlanta Braves on Thursday, manager Dave Roberts announced after Game 3 Wednesday night.\\nKershaw’s back issue flared up after Saturday’s bullpen workout and forced the Dodgers to start Tony Gonsolin in Game 2—an 8-7 loss to the Braves—on Tuesday. Kershaw had “a pretty aggressive” bullpen workout before Tuesday’s game in Globe Life Field and received treatment Wednesday.\\n“He was letting [the ball] go, and he came out of it great,” Roberts said before Game 3. “Every day it’s been better. … I talked to him briefly [Wednesday]. He’s in a good head space. I just know that we’re in a better place than we were [on Tuesday]. What that means, I don’t know quite yet.”\\nKershaw threw eight shutout innings, allowing three hits, striking out 13 and walking one, in a 3-0 win over Milwaukee in Game 2 of the wild-card series on Oct. 1. He allowed three runs and six hits, struck out six and walked none in six innings of a 6-5 win over San Diego in Game 2 of the division series on Oct. 7.\\nThe Dodgers use a record, 11-run first-inning scoring frenzy to rout the Atlanta Braves 15-3 in Game 3 of the NLCS.\\nRoberts said he does not expect Kershaw’s start to be shortened in any way.\\n“My expectation is that he’s going to go out there and make a start and help us win a ballgame,” Roberts said.\\nKershaw’s return will allow the Dodgers to start Dustin May in Game 5 and Walker Buehler in Game 6 if necessary. If the series goes seven games, Tony Gonsolin would be available to start the finale on regular rest.\\nBryse Wilson will start Game 4 for Atlanta, marking the sixth time in nine games the Braves will start a rookie pitcher this postseason. The 22-year-old right-hander spent most of 2020 at the team’s alternate training site. He went 1-0 with a 4.02 ERA in six big league games, two of them starts.\\nAsked whether he could have imagined over the summer that he’d be starting Game 4 of the NLCS, Wilson said, “Uh … no, not in a million years. Obviously, this is a goal of mine. For it to actually be coming true. I’m just super thankful.”\\nWilson, a Hillsborough, N.C., native who was a fourth-round pick out of high school in 2016, mixes a two-seam sinking fastball that averages 94 mph with a slider (88.8 mph), changeup (87.1 mph) and an occasional curve (78.8 mph).\\nThe Dodgers tore up the MLB record book with their 11-run first inning and 15-0 start in Game 3 of the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves.\\n“I really liked what I saw his last few starts,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “He’s starting to take a step forward and figure things out. I liked how he attacked guys and used his fastball.”\\nWilson threw a six-inning, 88-pitch simulated game last Friday after Atlanta’s division series sweep of Miami, so he’s “ready to go as long as the team needs me to,” he said. Wilson will be the third straight rookie to start in the NLCS, following Ian Anderson in Game 2 and Kyle Wright in Game 3.\\n“You watch video and you just have to kind of go as the game goes,” Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts said. “You’ve never faced them, so there’s no way to calibrate how it comes out of his hand and what his pitches look like. But it is what it is. It’s new for him. It’s new for us.”\\nSeager, Trout named Hank Aaron Award finalists\\nDodgers shortstop Corey Seager and Angels center fielder Mike Trout on Wednesday were named two of 14 finalists for the Hank Aaron Award, which is given each year to the best offensive player in each league.\\nSeager led the Dodgers in RBIs (41), tied for the team lead in average (.307) and was second on the team in OPS (.943). The performance was one of the best of his career. But it remains to be seen if he did enough to rival National League batting champion Juan Soto, who hit .351 with an MLB-best 1.185 OPS.\\nTrout won the Hank Aaron Award in 2019, a few weeks before being named American League MVP for the third time. A repeat in 2020 might be difficult. He batted .281 with a .993 OPS. He didn’t lead the American League in any notable offensive categories — though he did finish tied for third in home runs with 17.\\nFans will decide the fates of Trout and Seager. Ballots for the award can be cast online at MLB.com/hankaaronaward.\\nTrout was also nominated by his peers for the outstanding player award in the AL. Betts received the same honor in the National League. Freddie Freeman, Juan Soto, José Abreu and DJ LeMahieu are the other finalists.

       " 'How the ‘Great Resignation’ will impact those in-house\\nThe supposed mass exodus of professionals from their jobs in the coming months will likely impact upon law. What will happen in the corporate legal space?\\nThe ‘Great Resignation’\\nTo continue reading the rest of this article, please log in.\\nCreate free account to get unlimited news articles and more!\\nEarlier this month, Lawyers Weekly reported on the likelihood of a “Great Resignation” in Australia’s legal profession, following research from tech giant Microsoft revealing that over 40 per cent of the global workforce is actively considering leaving their employers.\\nAs Keypoint Law CEO Warren Kalinko noted, there will be “pent up demand” for change from lawyers of all stripes, especially now that the nation’s major cities are emerging from extended lockdowns.\\nLegal People partner Sharon Henderson added: “I am hearing from many [candidates] that they are burned out in their current role and set to start looking once 2021 is over.”\\nMoreover, Burgess Paluch Legal Recruitment director Paul Burgess noted, “low-interest rates, strong demand for employment and an economy highly supported by government COVID-19 support could be providing fuel for a storm once restrictions are eased in the major employment markets of Melbourne and Sydney”.\\nIt is critical to consider whether this “Great Resignation” will come for those in-house, as it appears it will for those in private practice.\\nAs Winc group general counsel and company secretary Troy Swan puts it, highly skilled and talented lawyers are in demand and highly employable and transferable.\\n“They stay in roles not because they need to, but because they want to,” he warned.\\nThis means that law department leaders must create an environment that resonates with a team and “not only meets all their basic hierarchy needs but goes above and beyond to create a special environment and be an employer of choice”.\\nIs it coming in-house?\\nLawyers Weekly spoke with four general counsel to examine the extent to which law department leaders anticipate such a wave of turnover in-house.\\nFor Mr Swan, it “seems real”.\\n“This trend serves as a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring our teams are being well recognised, well rewarded, provided with opportunities and increasingly given the ability to work on things that matter,” he proclaimed.\\n“There are increasing examples across many industries of people reassessing their values and opportunities as a result of the pandemic. Any material IP loss is a risk to any business and function, particularly a loss of that knowledge within a legal team which poses an even bigger risk.”\\nFreelance general counsel and legal influencer Anna Lozynski notes that if the “Great Resignation” is happening across business industries, one has to presume it will also affect the legal profession.\\n“I know that I have witnessed an influx of in-house roles hit the market at a rate not seen before. The pandemic has served as a wake-up call for many departments, workplaces and, of course, individuals across many levels,” she said.\\nNaturally, she submitted, the workplace needs to evolve.\\n“The pandemic has facilitated us having deeper conversations with team members, beyond mere career aspirations and job-related tasks. While resignations are not always convenient and easy to accept, for the most part, they create opportunities for fresh thinking, and new hires inject a new energy into the team.”\\nWiseTech Global general counsel Katrina Johnson noted that she “observed very much attrition or movement taking place in the in-house legal community, particularly among tech companies”, which she puts down to employees having placed a “much higher premium than ever before on flexible and individually tailored working arrangements, and this mode of working generally tends to align more closely with in-house legal environments compared with law firms”.\\n“For example, many in-house legal teams had already adopted flexible, remote and hybrid working models as part of their business-as-usual operations prior to the pandemic, and our employer organisations likely have had more experience than law firms when it comes to managing and responding to the needs of more diverse employee populations,” she said.\\nThese factors, she surmised, might provide in-house legal departments with some advantage over their private practice counterparts when it comes to meeting emerging and shifting requirements for employee preferences.\\n“That said, in-house leaders certainly can’t afford to be complacent, and I think they should always be actively focused on attraction and retention of talent,” Ms Johnson added.\\nTelstra general counsel Craig Emery suspected we might see a mixture of resignations, transitions and migration – the latter of which will be especially relevant, “as the days of where you work dictating where you live rapidly dwindle”.\\n“If you don’t have a strong employee value proposition, and if you don’t have a strong bias to flexibility, you’d perhaps be right to be concerned,” he warned.\\nMore flexibility needed\\nMr Emery does not believe that the age of coronavirus has dramatically altered what in-house lawyers value in their roles.\\n“People want a place where they feel valued, see purpose and meaning in their work, can grow their skills, are fairly compensated and rewarded, and have work-life balance,” he mused.\\nWhat the last 18 months have brought into sharp relief, however, is the elevated need for flexibility, he said.\\n“People have experienced what it is like to work full-time from home. Some will want to make this their predominant ‘way’ of working, using the office rarely, if at all. I’ve heard it said that flexibility used to be a differentiator, but COVID-19 has now meant it is standard across the board.\\n“Personally, I think time will tell if that is true.\\n“I believe those companies that maintain complete flexibility, and don’t resort back to being in the office as standard, with working from home acceptable only on occasion, will have an edge in terms of both recruiting and retaining talent.”\\nMs Lozynski agreed, saying that law department leaders must allow for flexibility “in droves”.\\n“Working remotely or in a hybrid fashion requires greater accessibility of leaders, organising things differently and more consciously. If communication is not a team strength, then that’s a good one to address and transform, ensuring it’s a mix of 1:1 time and team connection,” she argued.\\n“As humans, who also happen to be lawyers, we want to be seen, heard and valued. That means there is no ‘one size fits all’, but rather a customised approach for each staff member – that’s a direct contradiction to ‘company culture’ as we have known it.”\\nFor example, Ms Lozynski pointed out, employees with the ages of 18 and 25 reported in Microsoft’s research that they were more likely to struggle balancing work with life (+8 percentage points) and to feel exhausted after a typical day of work (+8 percentage points) when compared to older generations.\\n“For Gen Z’s, feeling a sense of purpose and connection is essential to feel satisfied at work, but remote work makes this more challenging, especially for those new to the workforce,” she said.\\nBetter workplace culture and wellness support\\nMoreover, Mr Swan said, legal leaders should “always be mindful” of the culture and environment they are creating.\\n“Building purpose-driven, highly capably tight teams that understand the business, have the relevant relationships and matching skill sets and importantly can navigate an organisation to help the business achieve its desired outcome, does not happen overnight,” he outlined.\\n“It is generally the result of many interactions and building relationships during times of difficulty when parties are forced to work together to achieve a common outcome.\\n“Trust is built during war,” Mr Swan went on.\\n“Members of a legal team are generally some of the most important across an organisation because of the knowledge and value they bring to a problem and the business. We need to create an environment where people actively want to be part of the team and want to come to work.\\n“This means team members must be well rewarded and recognised for their work and must be given opportunities to explore their own areas of interest within the requirements of the business.”\\nThis also means, Ms Johnson said in support, being more focused on idiosyncratic wellness needs and then being responsive to those idiosyncrasies of individual team members.\\nI believe that legal leaders should be more focused than ever on the wellbeing and engagement of their teams and in doing what they can to be responsive to the needs of individual team members.\\n“We’ve all asked a lot of our people over an extended and challenging period, and we owe it to them and to our teams to ensure we’re focused on their satisfaction and retention. I think it is important to start by asking your team members what they need (rather than assuming what that is) and actively seeking their suggestions as to the types of support you can provide that would be most helpful to them,” she advised.\\n“Not everyone will have the same needs, and a ‘one size fits all’ approach won’t work. Leaders shouldn’t presume to know what each of their team members will need at any particular point in time, but should instead be conscious that needs will continue to shift over time.”\\nTherefore, Ms Johnson continued, it is important for leaders to keep checking in with their team members and actively soliciting their feedback while also ensuring they are responsive to and action that feedback.\\n“Some other ways that leaders can demonstrate tangible support range from small things like asking team members to take their 1:1s or team calls while out on a walk (so that you deliberately prompt them to take a break and get out of their home working environment) through to providing ‘bonus’ days of additional leave as a thank you, and prioritising investment in their learning and development.”\\nOpportunities for in-house leaders\\nThis all said, the coming months present myriad chances for employers to improve their value propositions for in-house counsel.\\nMs Johnson: “Employee expectations are evolving, and I anticipate that lawyers will increasingly expect and seek out environments where they are afforded maximum flexibility and individualised support from leaders who are genuinely empathetic and caring, who encourage collaboration rather than competition within their teams, and who are actively responsive to the needs of their individual team members.\\n“I think the servant model of leadership is also likely to become more common in future in response to these changes. In-house leaders who embrace these qualities will likely be well-placed to attract and retain talented individuals into the future.”\\nFor Ms Lozynski, the key will be for leaders to continually adapt.\\n“Experiment with new ways of connecting with staff. Keep communication high, at an individual level but also at a team level. Encourage staff to pursue their passions outside of work – side hustles, networking, seeking other qualifications,” she said.\\n“Think outside of the box – is it possible to apply all or part of a learning and development budget not only towards pure work-related items but say on a yoga teacher training course or personal coaching if that’s going to serve that team member and develop them as a human (rather than purely as a lawyer on the job).”\\nAnother option that must be considered, Ms Lozynski continued, is connecting with ALSP models and freelancers in the case of looming staff shortages.\\n“Traditional law firms may not always have the resources to support secondments, and so it is important to have a varied network in place to call on when a resourcing need arises,” she identified.\\nOrganisations that do not authentically value the contribution made by key members or their changing needs, Mr Swan advised, will ultimately see a negative impact on their performance.\\n“This will provide opportunities for peer set organisations to access high performing people that may not otherwise be available or seeking a shift. The increasing war for talent, particularly in-house, is exacerbated as a result of global phenomena such as this, and reinforces the basics of teams and leadership and the value they create to an organisation,” he detailed.\\nPerhaps just as important, Mr Emery suggested, will be the opportunity to evaluate one’s leadership and value proposition in the face of staff movement.\\n“Where people do leave, seek to deeply understand why, and adjust accordingly. Equally, look to understand why people leave places other than yours, and reflect on whether you’re exposed in the same way.”',\n",

       " \"Project planning is the art of maximising resources within a given time against known tasks. While the mechanism of building a project plan is well known, the way of collecting the necessary supporting data for the plan has barely changed in thirty years.\\nIn today's database centric environment, where most companies run tightly interconnected systems, it is absolutely critical that the evaluation, changing and testing of individual components is done in a sensible, methodical and cost effective way. The ideal approach to project planning is to ensure that all information relating to the structure of the system is understood in advance, and any dependencies in code, files or reports are fully understood. The sheer scale of major maintenance projects means that this information cannot reliably be collected manually. Inventory Driven Planning is essential.\\nEveryone surely agrees that the more relevant information you have on hand when planning a project, the more likely it is to succeed. The information required is:\\nFrom the knowledge base of previous projects, a project planner will have a good idea of the tasks involved in changing a program, and the time required to accomplish them. The resources available to the project will also be known, or can be assumed. But what are the components on which the resources will carry out the tasks? Legacy Software's quikPLAN is a simple, automated, solution for planning complex projects. Legacy Software's market leading Legacy Directory collects information about your computer systems. Once the information has been assembled, planning your maintenance projects should be a snap!\\nBy utilising the system information held within The Legacy Directory, all the dependencies between systems components are identified and catalogued. This information can then be generated and passed to the Project Planners.\\nDoes that really solve the overriding problem of what is going to be done with the information?\\nThe sensible solution that Legacy Software has adopted with quikPLAN, is that the objects held within The Legacy Directory are merged with a set of standard information:\\nIt's as simple as that! A full-scale project plan is literally a few simple mouse-clicks away.\",\n",
       " 'I’ve only just arrived in Morocco and internet here is fairly spotty, with upload speeds slow enough that I’ve been unable to update the blog thus far. For a first post, I wanted to highlight some photos from what has struck me since I set foot into this colourful, mystical country – the details. From the ornate carvings on the walls of mosques and madrassas to the bags upon bags of spices and grains, each piled almost casually atop the other but forming a beautiful symmetry as a whole, to the doorknobs and brass statues I’ve seen thus far.\\nThere are plenty of traditionally compelling photos from this country, and I’m sure I’ll post more of those later. But for the moment what stands out above all else is the craftsmanship and detailing in the myriad of parts that make up the whole, even those details that we see in nature as we wind our way through the country. And I really like the fact that is the aggregate of all those small, special things thatmade the biggest first impression overall. Given that they all stood out in my mind, I wanted to share them here with you.\\nMorocco Photography: Details Aplenty\\nA note about these photos: they are taken with my new camera, the first one I’ve bought in years. It’s an Olympus E-P3, with a pancake (aspheric) f/1.7 20mm lens. I’m still really getting used to it – I find myself focusing on the wrong things or getting far too close to the subject as I’m used to my little S90 point and shoot. But it’s been great fun to learn how the camera works and what it’s capable of. I’m very happy I chose to get a Micro 4/3ds and not a DSLR; it’s great not to have a big camera to lug through the medinas.\\nI’ll also be posting about my ridiculous long-haul flight to Casablanca and plenty of photos from the foods I’ve eaten on the trip. As the internet is quite unreliable, I’ll be adding pictures one by one (and more frequently) on the Legal Nomads fan page.\\nMore to come soon!',\n",
       " 'Mon-Fri, 7am – 7pm CT\\nFamily law issues like divorce, child custody and adoption can be some of the most difficult to deal with due to the strong emotions involved. It’s not uncommon to feel uncertain and scared. Having the comforting hand of a competent provider lawyer to guide you will reduce stress, protect your rights and minimize negative impact on any children involved. For as little as $24.95/month, a LegalShield legal plan gets you access to a team of experienced lawyers, so you can resolve the issue correctly and legally, and move on with your life.\\nYour personal legal plan allows you to contact your lawyer to get legal advice, letters and calls, document review and more for an unlimited number of personal legal matters related to family law.\\nEven if your divorce is uncontested and relatively low drama, making long-term decisions should not be rushed or taken lightly.\\nTo make good choices, it’s important to understand how the divorce process works, how long it takes and your rights and responsibilities. Divorce can require you to assemble financial information, file documents in the proper jurisdiction, negotiate with your spouse and a slew of other potentially overwhelming tasks. You don’t have to go it alone.\\nWorking with a divorce lawyer that can answer questions, guide your decision making and help you prepare documents can make your life much easier. A LegalShield membership allows you to speak with a family law lawyer for a fraction of normal legal fees and they can relieve much of the burden by handling an uncontested divorce on your behalf.\\nIf your divorce involves children, the stakes are high. Making sure child custody and child support are fair to both parties and represent the best interests of your children typically requires help from an impartial third party. For the sake of your kids, you need to get this right.\\nAlso, modifying existing child support or child custody orders post divorce can cause anxiety. Rather than wrestling with confusing forms and getting into arguments with your former spouse, you can dramatically reduce your stress by having a family law lawyer handle the situation for you.\\nWhatever your circumstances, having access to a LegalShield provider lawyer for child custody, child support, and related family matters can help you rest easier.\\nAdopting a child can be one of the most rewarding and special steps a person can take. Trying to get through the paperwork and procedures, not so much.\\nDeciding to change your or your child’s name is a big decision.\\nEliminate all stressing and guessing by getting a LegalShield legal plan. For one small monthly fee you can have access to a provider lawyer to help with adoption, name change and more.\\nFinding solutions to your legal issues doesn’t have to be stressful, complicated or expensive. LegalShield puts the power of legal representation within reach of any individual, family, or business. We work hard to make it easy, simple, and affordable to get the legal help you need, when you need it.\\nInstead of paying a lawyer by the hour, you pay a small fee (starting at $24.95/month) and have access to an independent lawyer that will provide a huge variety of legal services without a huge legal bill. Services like consultation with a lawyer, document review, drafting of debt collection letters and defense at civil trials are included as standard benefits. Using the plan just once can save you literally thousands of dollars.\\nUsing the plan is as simple as signing up and contacting our team. Once you’re a member, customer support will connect you with an independent lawyer in your area who specializes in the specific legal issue with which you need help. Also, you can download our super-simple app to quickly access your legal benefits and member perks anytime.\\nYou can use your plan as soon as your membership application is reviewed and your account is set up. The review process takes 12-24 hours (or less) from the moment you purchase your plan (on regular business days). Once accepted, you can be in contact with a lawyer and begin to use the plan benefits and member perks outlined in the membership agreement right away.\\nThe average lawyer in the U.S. charges between $150-$400 per hour. If you use your membership for even just a few hours a year you could easily save over $1,000. If you have a bunch of small legal issues or one rather complicated issue, you can easily save multiple thousands of dollars over hiring a lawyer directly. Not to mention the stress you’ll save by having a lawyer on call instead of trying to handle legal issues yourself. Also, the lawyers in our network often help our members recover thousands of dollars of damages or avoid thousands of dollars in fees over what they would have experienced had they tried to resolve the legal issue themselves. Obviously, every member and usage situation is different, but when used correctly, your membership can easily save significant amounts of money. Not to mention savings from our member perks.\\nOur Personal Plan is really a family plan. You, your spouse or partner and your dependents living at home are covered under one membership.\\nThere is more information about this on the personal plan coverage & pricing page.',\n",

       " 'WHAT IT’S GOING TO TAKE, Part 2\\nI need your forgiveness. It has been rightly said that whenever you put an adjective (a modifying word) in front of the word justice that justice no longer means justice. This is why ‘social justice’ actually distorts the word justice. Thus, because I am forced to entitle this second instalment, True Justice (so as to distinguish it from all of the other modified versions of justice), I must seek your forgiveness – but I hope that the content of what I am going to manifesto will compensate for my literary violence. In this second instalment of my manifesto for how our society can experience and enjoy the divine blessings of happiness, security, wellness, fulfilment, enlightenment, and prosperity, I am going to challenge those who are called to arena of justice to fulfil their calling just as I did for those called to politics and government in the first instalment.\\nO LORD, You hear the desire of the afflicted;\\nYou will strengthen their heart;\\nYou will incline Your ear\\nto do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,\\nso that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.\\nWHAT IS JUSTICE?\\nJustice is primarily about what is right and true. It involves reasonable fairness based on what is right and true. (This is why we must be careful using the term social justice because it invariably involves positive unfairness.) Because it is grounded in what is right, it is unavoidably linked to the work of legislators who are responsible for codifying (writing in Law) what is right. This is why words matter. And this is why grammar matters (including pesky little things like commas and apostrophes which can inadvertently change the entire sentiment of a law).\\nGive justice to the weak and the fatherless;\\nmaintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.\\nThe Scriptures speak a lot about the need for those people of influence to defend those less fortunate from abuse and oppression. The need for justice is viewed in Scripture as especially needed for the vulnerable – widows, fatherless, disabled, and the destitute – who are most susceptible to have it denied to them. In the late 17th century in England, a person could be imprisoned for missing a repayment on a loan, or, even if it was only alleged (even falsely) that they had committed an offence, and there was no judicial process for them to get justice – and no release from their imprisonment – until they had paid the jailer for their time in remand. One of the reasons we should all thank God is for a legal right called Habeas Corpus which was introduced by the British Parliament in 1679, and has since been adopted by most western countries. It now means that someone cannot be imprisoned unless they have been charged with a crime and had their case heard in a court of law. Habeas Corpus is fundamentally grounded in a Christian worldview which regards all people as being equal under the law and entitled to reasonable justice. Sadly though, there are too many nations today where this is not the case and people can be held in prison – and even tortured – without being charged with an offence or the due process of having their day in court. Saudi Arabia is one of the worst such human rights abusers of any nation according to Amnesty International. Obviously they are not the only nation which do not recognise Habeas Corpus as a human right. China, Yemen, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Russia, and Turkey, each fail to provide reasonable justice to its citizens. Because I regard the unstoppable light of the Gospel through Spirit-empowered Christ-ambassadors to the transforming force for good in the world, I expect that eventually each of these nations will succumb to the message and influence of the Gospel and that they will subsequently embrace a Christian worldview in the justice systems. I therefore expect that there maybe teens reading this whom God has called from birth (they would have already become known for their keen sense of justice and concern for human rights globally) to become lawyers, or barristers, or attorneys, or judges, or justices, who will play a role on the international stage of diplomacy by using their trained legal minds to become the agents of such national transformations.\\nHow blessed are those who promote justice,\\nand do what is right all the time!\\nPsalm 106:3 NET\\nWHY DOES JUSTICE MATTER?\\nJustice matters for three important reasons. Firstly, it is the express will of God our Creator and an expression of His heart of love for all mankind. To promote true justice is to invoke God’s blessing (Psalm 106:3; 112:5). Secondly, it fulfils the second of God’s two great commandments for all people – to love your neighbour as yourself (Matt. 22:39). Thirdly, it becomes the framework for the Gospel to be understood and heightens men’s consciences to their unworthiness and need for a Saviour (Rom. 7:7).\\nHave you sensed the call of God on your life to be a minister of justice? I’ve already mentioned lawyers and judges as ministers of justice, but there are also those who serve as police and in the military. In addition to these public service roles, there are other ways to minister which you may not be familiar with and while some of them are ‘front-line’, many are invaluable behind the scenes roles. For example –\\nThe International Justice Mission – works to free slaves around the world by working with local law enforcement. IJM Officers are usually seconded from experienced ex-Police and Military personnel. They rely on public donations for their vital work. Did you know that there are more people in slavery today than at any other time in human history?\\nCompassion Australia – is a Christian based organisation which is working to break the cycle of poverty in the Two-Thirds World. On their website they state, “Worldwide, 385 million children live in extreme poverty. Poverty robs children of their basic rights to learn, play and grow. In its ugliest form, poverty can lead to exploitation, child labour and even death. It’s unacceptable. That’s why our Child Sponsorship Program exists. Because more powerful than poverty is the hope of Jesus, the care of a local church and the encouragement of you: a loving sponsor.“\\nWorld Vision is possibly the world’s largest child sponsorship ministry. In Australia, under the leadership of Claire Rogers, they have made a significant re-mission focus back toward being a Gospel support ministry.\\nThe Alliance For Defending Freedom is based in the USA and has a team of attorneys who take up the legal cause of Christians who are being ill-treated because of their faith in Christ. There are moves afoot to launch a similar ministry in Australia.\\nWHAT IT’S GOING TO TAKE\\nFor those called into the frontlines of the judicial system as lawyers and barristers, and for some of you, as justices, your pathway necessarily involves you reading the classics and studying history, theology, English, philosophy and rhetoric – before you embark on your law degree studies. Chances are, that if God has already called you into the legal fraternity, you have already met practising lawyers and law students. Your road ahead is going to hard. It will require you to become highly self-disciplined and determined. You might be surprised how God will use you once you have qualified as a lawyer – it may not be in the courtroom where He will use you and your training!\\nIn recent times in America, and in other countries, radical social change has taken place when just one unelected judge made a ruling that changed the law and thereby the course of history! We need lawyers and judges who fear the Lord and understand the Christian worldview is not about imposing religious ideas, but about upholding reasonable justice and th truth for all – especially the most vulnerable. For those of us, and that’s most of us, who are not called into the frontlines of administering and ensuring justice, we can play our part in three vital ways:\\n1. At the ballot box – don’t waste your vote! If any political party or candidate promotes injustice (especially where the most vulnerable will be abused) do not vote for them! No political party or candidate is perfect, but whenever a party scandalously boasts about having a policy where they will fund the termination of a person’s life – whether it be a baby in the womb, or grand-parent in a nursing-home – do not vote for them!\\n2. Over coffee – whether it be catching up with your girlfriends or mates, or even around the water-cooler at work, when injustice is innocently and ignorantly promoted in conversations, be prepared to offer a winsome, reasonable, correction. This might be in the form of two questions- “Do you believe the unjustified taking of an innocent human being’s life is wrong?” “Did you know that without exception, those who work in the field of Human Embryology all regard a foetus in a mother’s womb as a human being?”\\n3. On your knees – those in the political and justice spheres often feel that the Christian community are not fully behind them – and often feel that many in the Church simply do not care about the big issues confronting our society. As someone who is frequently the beneficiary of other’s prayers, I well know the difference between having people praying for you and no-one praying for you. It is my desire to inspire and help many more Christ-followers into politics and law, and it is equally my desire to muster people who will pray for them to be strong in Christ and His Word, and filled with courage to do what is right.\\nCan I count on you to do these three much needed things? If you are one of the few whom God has called into the sphere of Law, you are destined to play an important role in defending the rights of the vulnerable, and uphold the reasonableness of the Christian worldview. And this is a role we need more lawyers and justices who know the love of Christ to fulfil.',\n",

I haven’t tried them yet, so this isn’t an endorsement, but I thought I’d do a quick mention here in case you’re in the same situation and have been looking for a tool to help.\\nThe problem is that in the meantime, I’m not sure anymore that I want to migrate, because recent improvements to Apple Music have increased how much good new music I discover on the service… ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\\nI’m considering running both services in parallel for a while, a kind of cage-fight of music streaming, to see which emerges victorious.\\n🤬 I know why they do it, but I still hate the \"help me fill out cell D12 in my spreadsheet\" types of questions during earnings calls.\\n🤔 Remember the panic about blood clots a few months ago?\\n✍️ Muphry\\'s law:\\nMuphry\\'s law is an adage that states: \"If you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written.”\\nThe name is a deliberate misspelling of \"Murphy\\'s law\".\\nThis is perfectly illustrated by this Twitter account which tracks the typos made by another account solely dedicated to pointing out typos and errors in the New York Times.\\nh/t friend-of-the-show Alex!\\n💚 🥃 Rather than try to convince you to become a paid supporter, I’ll do something a bit different today. As a follow-up to my jargon thing in edition #166, I’ll just post this classic monologue by the late George Carlin (h/t to reader Kamil Ryszkowski for sending it):\\nA Word from our Sponsor: In Practise\\nDo you want to invest in high-quality businesses? In Practise is a research service for fundamental investors to learn about high-quality companies.\\nIn Practise conducts hundreds of high-quality interviews with CEOs from the best companies globally. All are available on mobile and desktop.\\nAll for the price of only $40 per month.\\n🌟 Sign up here (free plan available). 🌟\\nTwo great recent interviews you’ll love:\\nInvesting & Business\\nJeff Bezos 2004 Amazon All-Hands Meeting\\nAs told by Jeff Lawson:\\nIn September 2004 I joined Amazon as a product manager, and at the first all-hands meeting I attended, our founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, said something that has stuck with me ever since. [...]\\nsomeone in the crowd of about five thousand people got up and asked a question about retailing—I don’t even remember exactly what it was. But Jeff came back with an answer most of us didn’t expect.\\n“Amazon,” he said, “is not a retailer. We’re a software company.” [...]\\n“Jeff’s point was that Amazon was just as much a software company as Microsoft or Oracle or Adobe. It just happened that instead of being the product that we shipped to consumers, our software ran behind the scenes, allowing us to ship brown boxes with books or music or just about anything to someone’s doorstep.\\n“Our business is not what’s in the brown boxes,” he said. “It’s the software that sends the brown boxes on their way.” We monetized our software not by selling it directly, but by selling everything else—books, DVDs, and CDs. What’s more, the quality of our software would determine whether we succeeded: “Our ability to win,” Jeff said, “is based on our ability to arrange magnetic particles on hard drives better than our competition.”\\nI had heard that very last sentence somewhere in the past, I don’t know if it was someone else reporting on the same event or if Jeff just used that one a bunch of times (I’d bet on the latter — as I wrote in edition #74, Bezos is very good are compressing ideas into memorable and effective bite-sized capsules).\\nBut anyway, I’ve always loved that way of putting things. Crazy to to think that you have a huge organization, but what matters most at the end of the day is having a better sequence of 01010101000101010111010101010 than the competition.\\nI also liked this part:\\nSo at Amazon, an internal culture of API documentation arose. One team could find another team’s API documentation and start using their services, often without even needing to talk. [...]\\nIf one team ran their service on ten thousand servers, was that good, or was that horribly inefficient? And what business purpose should that cost be ascribed to? So Amazon started ascribing a cost to using these services, even internally. Some people call this transfer pricing, but in fact it’s a system of doing two things: holding teams accountable for their costs, and deciding where to put more resources in budget cycles.\\nSmall teams are accountable for the efficiency of their service, because they have to effectively publish a “price” for internal customers, and those internal customers have to pay the costs out of their P&Ls. If those “customers” aren’t happy with your costs, then you have work to do. The internal system of accountability aligns everybody’s interests and creates a natural incentive to drive for greater efficiency over time. Internal pricing also enables leaders to make good budget decisions. [...]\\nwithout an equalizing scorecard across your initiatives, it wouldn’t necessarily be clear what teams need more investment. So that’s why adding a pricing function, even for internal customers, is tremendously useful.\\nAmazon is known for the two-pizza teams and for the API culture for interfacing with internal and external orgs that was decreed by Bezos himself, but this second part is less well-known.\\nPutting a price on internal resources certainly has had to contribute to better capital allocation and efficiency than if the only real “cost of capital” was what you could convince a manager to sign off on…\\n‘Amazon cloud executive Charlie Bell is leaving [AWS] after 23 years’\\nSpeaking of Amazon, I wonder where Bell will go next.\\nAny cloud company looking for a CEO right now?\\nOne Does Not Simply Walk Into Gaming + My Old Apple Gaming Theory\\nGavin Baker with an interesting take on how hard it may be for big tech to compete with the gaming companies in VR:\\n1) Roughly 20 years after launching the first Xbox and making it a top strategic priority over the last few years, Microsoft still trails Sony from a units, revenue and profit perspective in console gaming.\\n2) Yet so many are quick to assume that it\\'s going be trivial for other megacap tech co\\'s to design amazing VR hardware and develop an ecosystem that can compete with the Xbox/PC and Sony gaming ecosystems whenever they decide to get serious about VR. Might be 2022 for Sony.\\n3) I promise the first party VR AAA exclusives from Sony and Xbox will be more compelling to gamers than any Oculus exclusive so far. And post Bethesda, this is going to include a lot of top 20 titles.\\nEverybody assumes that they can just walk into gaming, but it\\'s a different culture (not always in a good way, ugh) and requires many specialized skills that the big tech companies may not have, or that may conflict with other priorities.\\nF.ex., Apple has everything it needs on paper — great hardware and human-interface skills, great software skills, a huge distribution channel — but they just never got it (non-casual gaming). Does Facebook truly *get* (non-casual) gaming?\\nA few years ago, I thought Apple was going to become one of the main gaming companies simply by coming out with an Apple TV that was basically a gaming console.\\nSell it with a great game controller 🎮, have great graphics and a great development platform, plug into App Store existing distribution, and devs would jump on board to have a chance to sell their games into one of the biggest and most profitable ecosystems of customers out there.\\nDay 1 they could’ve had lots of more casual titles available from iOS ports, and then they could seed the ecosystem by doing very favorable deals with the big studios to port their big titles to Apple too, and maybe acquire a studio to have some good AAA exclusives…\\nEverything could’ve lined up. But 🕹Serious Gaming 👾 just isn’t in Apple’s DNA.\\nCan Facebook pull it off? Or will they create a bunch of VR for social stuff, some casual games, and have Oculus as a PC peripheral, but the serious VR gaming will end up on Sony and Xbox (and maybe Nintendo at some point?). ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\\nThe Trade Desk’s Rule of 143 + Connected TV\\nTTD with revenues up 101% and EBITDA margin at 42%. So that\\'s a rule of 143, right?\\n(of course Q2 2020 was a very weak quarter to compare to, but still…)\\nJeff Green on the Reach of Connected TV:\\nwe reached more households via CTV in the U.S. today than are reachable through linear TV. Today, we reach more than 87 million households [...]\\nMoffettNathanson recently reported that the ad-supported video-on-demand market is growing from $4.4 billion in 2020 to about $18 billion as early as 2025 [...]\\nCTV growth in EMEA grew 11x year-over-year.\\nPretty impressive how fast this switch away from linear TV has been happening (of course, accelerated by the pandemic).\\nIf you’re differentiated, you can charge based on value, not cost…\\nI enjoyed this part of Patrick O’Shaughnessy’s interview with Segment CEO and co-founder Peter Reinhardt:\\nwe were really scared to ask for money. We sent out this apologetic email to the top 15 customers or something by volume. And we basically said, \"Hey, we\\'re thinking we need to raise the price to about $15/month. Would that be okay with you?\" And bless his heart. This guy Edwardo from Brazil wrote back and he said, \"Guys, this price is so low that I may have to stop using your product because there is no way you\\'re going to be around in a year. So don\\'t charge me more but you better raise your price.\" [...]\\nMitch stops and says, \"Peter, in this meeting, you need to ask for $120,000 contract.\" And I was like, \"Mitch, that is 1000 times more expensive than our public price listing. I don\\'t know what you\\'re smoking. I cannot go in and ask for a 1000x price increase.\" And he\\'s like, \"Well, then I quit as your sales advisor.\" It was literally our first thing. And I was like, \"Okay, I\\'ll ask for $120,000.\" So we go into this. He\\'s like, just trust me. That\\'s the base rate for any enterprise contract which in retrospect is true. As we go into this thing. And then Nat\\'s like, \"Okay, well what\\'s the price?\" And I was like, well, and I turned beet red. I was like, \"Nat the price is $120,000.\" And I was not believable in any fashion. And he looks at me and is like, \"How about $12K a year?\" And I was like, \"How about $18?\" So he agrees to $18K and became our first contract, I think or the second contract once we finally got around to signing. So he was victorious. He saved 85%. I was completely mind-blown because here we were charging 150x, literally 150x. That was a second big awakening moment for me. That the value that we were attaching in our minds was on a cost basis rather than a value basis. And then we had no understanding of the value that we were actually providing to customers but in B2B sales, value is what you should sell on and value is what matters to the customer. They couldn\\'t care less what cost basis is.\\nThis reminds me of a discussion I’ve often had about Apple, and how they can charge a lot more for CPU, storage and RAM upgrades than, say, some random PC or Android maker.\\nIf you’re not differentiated, you have to compete on price. Duh.\\nIf you charge more than what someone else who is selling something pretty functionally equivalent is charging, they’ll just switch.\\nBut if you *are* differentiated, price still matters, but a lot less, and you can charge closer to the value provided.\\nDoubling the storage on my iPhone from 128gb to 256gb may not cost Apple anywhere close to $100 in parts, but the value it provides me is more than $100 (storing more photos and videos of my kids, more podcasts, apps, TV show episodes, whatever.. not having to worry about running out of space and having to deal with that. That’s worth a lot more than $100 in utility to a lot of people).\\nThey can charge for it because if I’m not ready to pay, all that’s available to me is pretty different and may not be what I want.\\nThink of it this way: If your partner wants to upgrade their old iPhone and asks you to go buy a new one, and you come back with a Samsung Galaxy and tell them you saved $100 on the storage upgrade, what will they say?\\nMario Gabriele wrote about crypto-exchange FTX, and this part stood out to me:\\nPart of FTX’s popularity is due to the leverage it offers traders. Thanks to the risk engine described above, it is able to provide a higher margin with less work, relative to other exchanges.\\nFor most of its brief history, FTX has offered 101x leverage. Hypothetically, that meant that if a trader added $100,000 to their account, they could invest $10.1 million. While winning trades can make a huge sum of money thanks to this leverage, losers can find themselves quickly buried by a bad bet.\\nAfter its most recent fundraising round, FTX noted it was reducing the available leverage on the platform to 20x.\\n‘what a round trip’\\nScience & Technology\\n‘perhaps the most successful cyber attack in the history’, Belarus Edition\\nFound this via Eliezer Yudkowsky, and his tweet provides good context:\\nAny time you propose giving a government surveillance powers, you need to keep in mind how awful almost every government is at computer security. Also, holy snarkleroys they made off with what sounds like the entire secret police database.\\nHere is the thread. The whole thing is worth reading, it’s just bonkers.\\nFirst they’ve downloaded the entire “АИС Паспорт” database which contains all personal details of every Belarusian citizen including passport photos, home address, place of work (including those with restricted access who work in KGB and other special services) [...]\\nCyber-partisans hacked the entire police database and got access to cameras (at police stations, prisons and even police drones), restricted information about the work history of every police officer (their cases, offences they committed etc). [...]\\nperhaps most importantly they got access to terabytes of tapped phone calls of regime opponents as well as its supporters (can’t be too careful, right?) Here Luka’s spokesperson asking the head of Minsk SWAT to cover them while she’s out “human hunting” opposition activists\\nStill a lot of work to do…\\n‘Scammer Service Will Ban Anyone From Instagram for $60’\\nWe’ve seen the rise of ransomware-as-a-service recently, with groups that will provide the support infrastructure for black-hat hackers to do their extortion, and take a cut for their trouble.\\nBut there’s all kind of assholes out in the world who will build businesses around being dicks to individuals and companies.\\nThis “ban-someone-as-a-service” stuff is an example:\\nScammers are abusing Instagram\\'s protections against suicide, self-harm, and impersonation to purposefully target and ban Instagram accounts at will, with some people even advertising professionalized ban-as-a-service offerings so anyone can harass or censor others (Source)\\nThe Arts & History\\n🎵 Kalaido — Lo-fi Instrumental Hip-Hop Beats + Japanese Flavor + Jazzy Late Night Vibes\\nThis one is for those who enjoyed the recommendation for Elijah Nang in edition #165.\\nKalaido has many similarities, and I’ve enjoyed the two albums pictured above.\\nHere’s a short video of the artist performing some of the instrumentation. I always like to see this behind-the-scenes stuff.',\n",

       " 'You have no items in your cart. Want to get some nice things?Go shopping\\nPromise yourself: If they catch you, you’ll deny it. Decide that you will play dumb. Practice seeming confused, insisting genuinely to an invisible supervisor that you were looking for a different file, one that you were asked to get. Realize while laying in bed after your fourth day of work that if you end up doing this, you should do it within the first month, so it’ll be more believable if you do get caught. Reach for your phone on the nightstand and look up Virginia state laws for accessing unauthorized medical records. Read about a podiatrist named Zhang Liu Jie. Wonder how you would do in prison for four months. Start Googling whether prisoners are allowed to have tampons. Fall asleep with the thought that probably you should just avoid it altogether.\\nLate at night on Wednesday of your second week, spend hours flinging yourself into different but equally ineffective positions on your bed. Feel at least two itches on some part of your body at any given time. Become uncomfortably aware of your breathing for what feels like a solid hour. Open your eyes and stare up into the darkness. Make a face like you are looking at someone who has chosen intentionally to piss you off. Get up.\\nHave a glass of wine at the kitchen table from a mostly-full bottle in the fridge. Have another. Take the bottle back to bed without a glass and finish it, knowing that this was what you planned the moment you got out of bed to open the fridge in the first place. Fall asleep around four or five in the morning. Wake up at your last alarm at 6:25am, absolutely still drunk. Put on a brown dress with a high collar that makes your neck itch. Don’t put on any makeup. Call a cab. Get to work and walk through the hallways staring at the floor. Try to focus your vision enough to see the thin silver lines that divide up a white speckled desert of linoleum tiles. Get to your desk.\\nLean down over the side of your chair and squint to confirm that yes, the silver lines are there after all. Straighten up. Turn on your monitor. Listen to the quiet of the building, since you’re here actually rather early after not showering or putting on eye-shadow. Log in. Settle into the scratchy neck of your dress. Idly open the hospital mega-database network icon. Idly go through three more login screens. Peer doubtfully at a black line blinking at the beginning of a long white text bar.\\nLook up a name.\\nIf you type in “Mallory Dunn,” open a page with the correct birth year listed and let your eye wander down a table of dates and doctors and pronouncements of the body given in capital letters, strange abbreviations and unknown terms. Bounce off a few words that are staring out from the mass of black-on-beige text, each one like a hostile yet familiar face in the crowds of a foreign market. Like the assassin in a 50s movie you watched once in a dim hotel room. He painted himself orange as if it would disguise him among Moroccans, and chased the man who recognized him down alleyways to send him staggering out into the sunlight, a knife unreachable exactly in the center of his back. Realize just how drunk you still are.\\nClick print for the one crowded page of the summarized file before you can think about how stupid that is. Rip it from the jaws of the printer. Stuff it dramatically in your bag. Spend all day sobering up and ruminating on horrors of the abdomen. Feel like each woman around you knows by heart a history that is only hers, the details of a long-term relationship, with first occurrences made into legends and knock-down drag-out fights and hard-won victories and silent burdens and the bitter pride of old battle scars. Find yourself stealing glances at shirt fronts: the blank wall of loose blue scrubs, a gentle suggestion of hill and belly-button through pink cotton, rolls of fat jiggling smoothly under a skin of teal jersey. Give up. Sit on the bus without your headphones and listen to your silent abdomen.\\nOnce you get home, remember one Halloween that she spent talking to a tall man in a dapper black coat with a large, elegant nose. Cut out everything but the nose until she is talking up to a tired literary reference. For some unknown reason, go looking for the hat you wore that night. Find it in a downstairs closet at the bottom of a box of gloves, its cheap white fur faded grey, small round ears permanently crumpled. Put it on. Tie the sides under your chin. Sulk, and unknowingly do a pretty good impression of how you looked most of that Halloween. Have a flashback of explaining to the nose that you and a friend (who had left the party) were dressed as characters from a cartoon.\\n“Is the character a bear? A small white bear?” he wondered.\\n“No,” you said, “He’s a boy.”\\n“Did you maybe put on the wrong costume?” ran the nose.\\n“No, he’s just a boy who wears a hat with ears on it.” No one knew what you were.\\nSit at your desk on Friday and repeat under your breath a Biggie Smalls lyric you can’t get out of your head, as you send out some tedious office-logistic-type emails. Sing it as, “I know my mother wished she got a fuckin’ smishmortion.” Tell yourself you’re singing it like that because it makes you laugh. Imagine you and her, still in love, walking to the zoo with a perfect three foot-by-two-foot shmishmorted Biggie. You are each holding one of his hands.\\n“I’ll make your motherfuckin’ brain warm!” he sings happily as he swings between the two of you. Wonder how much attention that might attract on the streets of San Francisco. Plan to get the whole family discreet wide-brimmed hats. Wonder what the rent is like in her neighborhood. Look up on Google maps how far away the west coast is. Change the route to “Walking” and drop the little orange street-view man at the beginning of a 3,079 mile line stretched across America. Click “begin route.” Stare down a blurry, pixelated arbor of trees.\\nIf you do not type “Mallory Dunn,” type “Louisa Gurman.” Know the exact date of birth because it is an annual source of guilt. Click the only possible file and skim through relatively bare sections until finally you get to a long list of ophthalmologists, the last one from a visit a few months ago, near her current listed address, in Maine. Scroll through a column of appointment dates aligned with a column of myopic prescription diopters that decline against each other in a pattern as exact and unchanging as the glide ratio of a crashing airplane. Stare dumbly at the staggering cost listed for the first two weeks of guide-animal training. Note that, at the very least, her astigmatism has still not shifted since she was fourteen.\\nThe next day at work, walk past a woman wearing a thin tortoiseshell headband. Turn to look at it. Get an odd glance in return. Get to your desk and think suddenly of the smell of new paint and the cold draft from a window blowing directly onto your left side as your sister showed you her first pair of glasses, which were striped bright green and yellow, a child’s tortoiseshell, with bendable rubbery frames so they would not be broken by anyone as small as both of you. Remember a twenty-two-year-old miracle: being handed the glasses unprompted, her uttering, “Put them on.”\\nLook up at her. Put them on wrong. Sit still when she tells you to, and try not to flinch away as she puts them on for you and then smooths your thin toddler hair out from under the ear hooks. Feel alien weight on your face and look out into twin basins of a warped and sharp-cornered world. Remember how precious and rare it was to be even in this madhouse version of her room. Stare at the space between your computer monitor and your keyboard, the whole world undone under a blur of wine and exhaustion. Picture blinky brown eyes behind increasingly thick glass. Push your tongue into the gap tooth you developed right after she got hers fixed. Wonder what her hair looks like now.\\nHave a song stuck in your head. Get as far as, “I know my mother—” Put some headphones in and listen to the Talking Heads instead.\\nRe-check her current address after lunch. Panic when you realize how close she could be to fleeing up into Canada. Picture a black stone house on a hill with a smoking chimney, half-buried in snow. Picture a polar bear creeping bare-toothed up the expansive white towards the house. Never quite realize that you have pictured a cartoon polar bear. Remember what she looked like wrapped up in winter garb, stamping deliberately out into a blizzard, curly hair flying from the sides of her hood. Feel nostalgia for a hard-fought childhood in Alberta together that never happened. Picture her aiming down the sight of a rifle. Make sure each movement is practiced. Keep her hands steady. Leave a squint ambiguously as either anger or concentration. Throw the arrangement of four black lines and a nose that is now the polar bear into an open roar. Place her finger on the trigger. Wait for her to fire. Wait.\\nIn a box of junk from the last room you shared with her, find a photo that has slid sideways in a nickel frame of clunky filigree hearts, and immediately start crying. It is early-ish digital and the details are slightly grainy and wrong—in one spot the pixels have failed to delineate where an incisor disappears into an upper lip. Hold the frame in your lap like a crystal ball and look down into it. Witness your sister at seventeen leaning back against the rail of a boat, the bow cutting pure-white against waves a mess of every possible blue, the island of Crete like a painted tile behind her and her skin more deeply olive than it ever was with you and your parents at home. She is half-smiling. She is wearing a pair of dark sunglasses.\\nWear real pajamas to bed that night. Spend the next day doing everything you’re supposed to do for your superiors. Get lunch with some nurses your age. Work in that office for seven years, and get pretty good at your job. Look up only the names of strangers, given to you by other people. Drink wine early enough in the evening that you are never drunk by morning. Befriend a cardiologist named Bill, and eventually name him as the godfather of your son. Never think about small rubber glasses, or a white boat off Crete, or the charging speed of a polar bear up an incline. Work on a computer all day. Never find yourself staring down an arbor of blurred trees. Never map a trail up to Maine.\\nAnna Bernstein is an undergraduate student at Macalester College where she studies English and Arabic.

       " \"My name is: Mahesh Natarajan.\\nMy stomping ground is: Delhi, India, with all the hustle and bustle of a big Indian city. I’m lucky to be in a quieter neighborhood with large public parks providing a welcome break. And, as often as I can, I’m on property at Ananda, which is a four-hour drive or a 40-minute flight for some rest, reflection and healing.\\nI’m known for being: I am the Chief Operating Officer for Ananda, one of the world’s most holistic wellness retreats, located in the Himalayas in India. Besides broader business responsibilities, I lead and am actively involved in our wellness programs, design, research and future growth.\\nI’m talking about: Our Dhyana Meditation program, which is a deeply immersive approach that guides guests through pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from the mind), dharana (focusing of the mental awareness) and awareness of the journey towards the experience of dhyana (continued meditative awareness).\\nYou can find it at: Offered throughout the year at Ananda.\\nBefore I started this mindfulness work, I was:\\nMy career began in the early 90s as a luxury hotelier and then across several industries as a brand and marketing strategist. Now, for the last 15 years, Ananda’s healing journey and my own are reflective of mindfulness and emotional healing which is of critical need today.\\nMy interest was sparked when:\\nAs a holistic retreat, our approach has always been to arrive at a harmonious balance between mind, body and soul. Physical well-being is targeted through Ayurveda to balance each individual’s bio energies through therapy and food as a medicine. The energy or prana and mental well-being are addressed through a combination of traditional yoga, breathwork and meditation. But the beginnings of the idea to create a deeply immersive program came a few years ago when I started to see a significant shift in the needs of our guests. Most of our clients are living fast-paced lives as leaders of industry, as entrepreneurs and in the corporate world, but, increasingly, this success is not translating to a sense of balance and harmony. There was a need to explore a much more spiritual journey rather than just experience this at the surface. Following a traditional meditative mindful journey, personally mentored by yogis with a wealth of experience, and being able to bring this into one’s daily life, was the answer.\\nHow it works is:\\nThe various concepts of Dhyana (meditation) and its practice originated in the Vedic era and have been influenced over the ages by various schools of study including Buddhism and Hinduism. The practice of meditation is one of the key tools that helps harmonize the mind and also taps into the full potential of the higher mind. By overcoming negative tendencies, it helps harmonize the whole personality and gives an overall sense of calm.\\nTopics related to the philosophy of yoga, the structures of the yogic system, the yogic and meditative lifestyle, the positive effects of mantras (sound vibrations) and self-study are discussed during these sessions. Daily personalized pranayama sessions promote breathing techniques that lead to control of pranas (energy) and the mind. Personalized yoga sessions focus on asanas accompanied by an awareness of one's energy. Soothing and healing therapies complement the mindful meditation and yoga sessions.\\nWhat makes it different is:\\nThe yogic system has referred to the mind not just as “mind,” but as the “mental body.” Because there is intelligence in every cell of the body. When your mental state is in balance, you feel a connection to your sense of self and your mind. Your behavior is confident and aware; you are by nature inquisitive and intelligent. You take ownership of your actions. However, when your mental state is out of balance, the tendency to become self-obsessed and egotistical takes hold and your behavior becomes insecure and unsure. Your sense of self either becomes too strong and you constantly put your own needs ahead of others, or it becomes too faint, creating weakness and insecurity.\\nAnanda’s unique Dhyana meditation program harmonizes the physical, mental and spiritual faculties, balances chakras leading to spiritual enlightenment, stimulates reflex points to restore energy flow in the body, reduces stress, boosts immunity, improves memory and normalizes sleep patterns.\\nMy favorite lesser-known detail is:\\nMantra meditation is such a powerful part of the mindfulness journey. It relieves the mind from its own obsessive nature. Mantra’s highest power is in its vibrations which impact the mind in several ways. In Kundalini Yoga, chakras are centers of energy. Each chakra is in the shape of a flower, with a different number of petals. We can also think of these chakras as an entire microsystem of nerves and impulses. Each of these nerves plexus are impacted by certain sounds or vibrations. Each petal has a certain “seed” mantra, which activates it. For example, the om (aum) mantra either on its own or when part of a larger practice is what activates the agya chakra or the third eye.\\nIn the early morning, the mind is rested. When we recite mantras in the morning, the resolve goes deep and positively influences the emotions, thoughts and actions throughout the day. So at Ananda the Mahamrityunjaya mantra is chanted each morning specifically for well-being. After that is the Gayatri mantra for creative power or energy. It’s my favorite element of the mindful journey. And, along with our yogis, we go deeper into understanding and teaching the intricate nuances of this ancient wisdom.\\nI hope our guests walk away feeling: More connected with their positive mental state, balancing emotional as well as spiritual growth. The program teaches practices that can be incorporated into daily life back home to ensure continued, long-term results. It does require effort and, for the true effects of a mindful, conscious journey to be reaped, three essentials are regularity of practice, practice for a sustained period of time and, lastly, faith in your own ability to transcend challenges to lead a fulfilled and blissful life.\\nMindfulness is so much more than a trend because:\\nMindfulness has been in practice for more than 5,000 years in the vedic system in India. The mental body is a retainer for all of the patterns we have accumulated, all the ways that we go about living our lives based upon our experience and upbringing. These patterns can propel us forward or hold us back from attaining full potential. So, a mindful journey is not a brief experience or a trend. With life getting increasingly fast-paced and digital advancements making us more disconnected in society, it is only by creating an authentic, lifelong journey of such practices that we can see true difference.\\nOne moment when mindfulness helped me was:\\nThe first time I started mantra meditation, it was a revelation. Each chant took me deeper into a very subtle part of my being. This was a time when I was navigating through several issues both on the work as well as personal front. I remember each mantra chanting practice creating so much clarity of thought, connection and belief in myself. It really helped me and has been helping me ever since.\\nThe words I live by are:\\nThe best gift I can give to myself and to everyone I am connected to is to create purpose and contentment. The answer lies in small everyday steps, whether spiritual reflection, chanting or immersion in uplifting classical music, which is a personal favorite.\\nOne truth that is so important, but people don’t always realize is:\\nThat mindfulness is a journey and not something to jump on and master like a competitive sport or a business deal. From becoming self-observant to focusing attention on a single point, extended periods of concentration naturally lead to meditation and ultimately to a state of being keenly aware without focus. At this stage, the mind has been quieted and, in the stillness, it produces few or no thoughts at all. While this may seem like a difficult if not impossible task, remember that all of this journey is a process. Even though we may not attain the picture perfect pose or the ideal state of consciousness, we benefit at every stage of our progress.\",\n",

While the automobile is our most-reported mode of transportation, attention is shifting to the socio-economic value for Niagara of building a seamless region-wide transit system linking efficiently to provincial GO transit.\\nThings We Are Doing Well\\n- Diverse groups in Niagara are working to inform planning for seamless regional transit, linked to GO train and bus service with capacity to connect Niagara to the GTA and New York State.\\n- Significant steps were taken in the fall of 2014 to advance toward a seamless, sustained regional transit system supported by regional government, local municipalities, post-secondary students, and poverty reduction and economic development networks in Niagara.\\n- Awareness is building about the value of planning for Active Transportation by looking through lenses such as economic development, Age-Friendly Community principles, accessibility, health and wellness, recreation, tourism and the environment.\\n- Niagara’s iconic waterways draw domestic and international traffic, for both recreation and business. A total of 8 marinas on the Great Lakes in Niagara draw significant boat traffic during spring and summer. The Welland Canal portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway allows large lakers and ocean vessels carrying bulk cargo to navigate to and from the heart of North America\\n- Multi-faceted linkages between transit availability and accessibility in Niagara and economic development, poverty reduction, wellness, employment and education are being described and quantified.\\n- We are gaining increased awareness about students’ and tourists’ role in financially supporting and utilizing public transit in Niagara, along with the economic benefits of making transit available and accessible for them.\\n- Growth in our cycling infrastructure and Active Transportation (AT) assets are geared toward creating a viable transportation network that keeps people involved in AT and motorists safe. Niagara’s cycling assets are increasingly being promoted to and appreciated by tourists.\\n- The “Getting There” initiative is exploring centrally-dispatched access to health and human services for Niagara’s most vulnerable people.\\n- Action to address environmental sustainability and alternative energy through transportation is apparent. Examples include ride and car sharing programs; the existence of 17 Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations around the region; and promotion of the comparative fuel efficiency and low carbon footprint of marine transportation for shipping bulk cargo.\\n- Some efforts are underway to reduce border crossing traffic congestion in Niagara by addressing complex issues around completing secure truck pre-inspections at the Peace Bridge crossing, to reduce overall truck and auto congestion, and improve traffic circulation.\\nSuggested Action Steps\\n- Increase our understanding of how students, tourists and people going to work utilize transit in Niagara, as important context for transit’s value to the region.\\n- Advocate for increased prioritization and funding of transit initiatives across the Region by local municipalities in partnership with the Regional Municipality of Niagara, to create a seamless and viable regional transit service.

Sometimes, I get so excited about trying new trends and putting my own spin on them that my wardrobe can end up looking like a pile of trends that don’t always stay in style for longer than a season or two. This summer, I have two missions: to shop smarter and to buy pieces that are versatile and can be worn over and over again. Naturally, this journey towards timeless, chic pieces that I’ll be styling all season long led me to a deep dive on Nordstrom’s site for the best basics I could find. I went in with a few things in mind: great shoes that can go from day to night, jeans that I’ll keep for years, and dresses that can go from the office to happy hour. As always, Nordstrom had everything that I was looking for and more, from all of my favorite brands like COS and Levi’s, and styles that feel fresh and elevated.\\nWhile I may be focused on shopping smarter, that doesn’t mean I’m willing to sacrifice style.

       " '(Lecture given in Montevideo, March 20th, 1939 by Carlos Bernardo Gonzalez Pecotche*)\\n\"I will address in this conference interesting aspects of the evolution of the thoughts, and I will also explain how the cultivations made by the student of Logosophy in the laboratory of his mind come to mature.\\nDue to the broad and profound nature of this topic, I will have to address it in parts, using as a reference some aspects related to the central image of the conference.\\nIt can be generally observed, and quite frequently, that the majority of people seek to resolve their problems or find solutions to complicated situations, or difficult occurrences that appear in the course of life, only during the brief moments that their minds deal with them and when the threat of danger already coerces them and urges an immediate and final decision.\\nLogosophy defines this position as inconsistent, unreasonable and illogical, comparing it, for example, to a person who seeks to eat the fruit before planting the tree, living in a house before building it, or reaching his destination before starting out. The same could be said of a man who would desperately try to accelerate the growth of a tree to obtain the fruit long before its time, or hastily build a house disregarding the solidity of its structure and shape just to live in it even before the roof and doors are put up, or even curse the vehicle that carries him to his destination just because it does not speed ten times faster to satisfy his whims and affliction.\\nAs already mentioned, this occurs quite frequently because one forgets that one has a mind which, once organized, can resolve all situations happily and protect one against disagreeable changes that affect one\\'s sensitivity so much. In other words, I would not exaggerate by saying that what the common man uses least are his precious mental faculties, the only ones capable of allowing him to live life consciously and breathe in peace.\\nSeveral times I presented to some advanced students problems or cases, asking them for a solution; in other words, I proposed to their minds such problems or cases to observe how each one would resolve them.\\nAfter a prudent waiting period during which an exchange of ideas would take place over the subject matter, I decided to suspend the conversation, for the time being, to be pursued later.\\nI proceeded in this manner two or three times..., addressing the proposed topic selected for the experiment.\\nAs expected, in nine out of ten cases, I was able to confirm the point being made tonight in my dissertation.\\nIn fact, during the second or third time around, pretending to be distracted, I addressed another topic before getting around to the one that was selected. I could notice during the conversation the facility with which the topic was now being addressed and how there suddenly appeared clear and satisfying conclusions to the problems or cases whose solutions were so difficult to reach during the initial conversations. At that moment they were shown the observations and solutions they had noted initially, and the surprise was unanimous.\\nI will now explain how this process of maturity is produced in the mind.\\nThe investigator of Logosophy, who has already acquired certain cognitions on the action of the thoughts as autonomous entities, does not force the free exercise of his mental faculties as would a person seeking a hasty and sudden magical formula to resolve the problems that unexpectedly coerce him. He stimulates them continuously, allowing them to absorb all pertinent elements while protecting them as much as possible from external perturbances that impede the process toward the solution that is elaborated in the mental area.\\nFrom time to time the topic in question is addressed mentally by each of the participants in the experiment in order to maintain in readiness the thoughts that were used and to stimulate the faculties to perform their function of preparing the specific elements which, when absorbed by the thoughts in charge of this mission, will produce the finding.\\nThis is how, in many instances and without undue effort, the needed solution emerges by itself, having matured after thorough and discernative labor totally exempt from any haste.\\nNaturally, this should not constitute for the student of Logosophy a motive of personal glory because it is unwarranted; he knows its origin, that is, the source which he uses to obtain these results and he knows also that such results are a consequence of a lucid and correct application of the cognitions that Logosophy places within his reach.\\nThe current academic disciplines in the universities, schools and classrooms in general use the system of mnemonic repetition of the topics that constitute the program or courses being taught.\\nThe objective is to etch images of these topics, but the results obtained only achieve reproducing them in the mental retina where they remain from that moment onward immobile and unable to be moved, since they lack a life of their own or the power originating from their original source.\\nLater on, when the student starts to use these images, he finds himself obliged to correct in each case the defects they present, not the defects of the original images but the defects of the reproduced images, because he ignores how they were constructed in the first place. He then experiences in practice the need to create new images which gradually substitute for those stored in his memory, which by now have become mostly worn out and useless.\\nThe new images - in this case cognitions - that he carefully places in his mind become achievable and display an array of living colors because they were made of the same element that exists within his own mental sphere. The common university student does not know of this process because he ignores how thoughts act and how they form nuclei to constitute the results or solutions being sought. Nevertheless, in spite of doing it unconsciously he achieves the objective; I refer to the process of reproducing images by his own experience.\\nI notice that some of the students present here have started only recently the study of this new science. For their own benefit I would like to say that I find it logical for those who are not familiar with the Logosophical literature or, better still, its specific terminology, to encounter initially certain difficulties in understanding the truths exposed by Logosophy in spite of its simple and easy language...\" - to be continued\\n*Excerpt from the book \"An Introduction to Logosophical Cognition\"originally published in Spanish.

The 1972 Aston Martin DBS was discovered in a barn in Surrey, England, in February 2015 and went on to fetch £45,000 ($69k) at a Coys auction in London.\\nThis 1960 Jaguar XK150 S had sat in a barn since 1996 after its owner had lost control of the car on a \"wet day\" and crashed it into a tree. Owned by the same person since 1969, its owner has since passed away and the car came up for auction this May. Incredibly, it sold for $127,552 (£90.3k), six times its estimate, even though the car is in need of expensive repair. The high price is down to a combination of a booming classic cars market and the rarity of Jaguar XK150s, especially of the high-performance S model.\\nIn 2007, antiques dealer Jeff Bidelman of Rare Collectibles was asked to look through an abandoned house by the late daughter\\'s owner, who heard rumours in her childhood that treasure was buried in a hole in the wall. It turned out the rumours were spot on. Bidelman discovered a haul of old coins worth a very respectable $200,000 (£101k).\\nNot only do these two rare Pontiac Firebirds date back to 1967, they were the first two of the classic cars ever to be made, used as a prototype so that the manufacturers could decide if they wanted to produce it. Found in a Connecticut barn in 2014 by Richard Rawlings, the host of Discovery Channel\\'s Fast N\\'Loud, they were restored and sold for $650,000 (£389k).\\nWorkers renovating a winery building in the Champagne region of France got the shock of their life in 2012 when they chanced upon 497 gold coins minted between 1851 and 1928 which were worth a total of $980,000 (£615k). In a surreal moment of discovery, the coins literally rained down through a hole in the rafters, drenching the astonished workers in gold.\\nBelieve it or not, this 300-year old statue, estimated to be worth £1.4 million ($1.9m) in 2016, was being used as a doorstop when it was discovered. The bust, created by French sculptor Edmé Bouchardon in 1728, was discovered in 1998 on an industrial estate in Balintore, Scotland by Councillor Maxine Smith. In 2016, it was reported that the former doorstop sculpture would be going on display at the Louvre. Talk about going up in the world.\\nWhen Connecticut-based artist Francis Hines passed away in 2016, he left behind hundreds of works of art in a barn he used as a studio. Known as New York\\'s wrapper – he famously wrapped the Washington Square Arch in 8,000 yards of synthetic fabric in 1980 – Hines worked until his death aged 96. The pieces were discovered in 2017 by mechanic Jared Whipple, who received a call from a contractor who thought he might be interested in the works that featured painted car parts. Whipple spent four years researching Hines\\' art and has been told the collection could be worth \"millions\", with some individual pieces worth up to $22,000 (£16.7k) each. He\\'s been given permission to keep and sell the artworks by Hines\\' family but plans to keep the majority. Around 40 of the pieces will be going up for sale from May this year.\\nMichael Rorrer was clearing out his late great aunt\\'s home in Virginia when he stumbled upon a collection of 345 comics in the basement. The collection belonged to his late uncle Billy Wright, who had never told anyone about his hobby before his death in 1994. The carefully-arranged collection included rare comics such as Detective Comics No 27, the first comic to star Batman (pictured). Unsurprisingly, the rare magazines fetched a whopping $3.5 million (£2.9m) at auction in New York in 2012.\\nDo you own any of these valuable modern comics?\\nAn unsuspecting French heir got a bigger inheritance than he\\'d bargained for in 2016, when the rickety house he\\'d inherited turned out to contain a huge stash of gold. The hoard, which had been there for around 70 years, was worth $3.8 million (£2.7m), and was distributed throughout various hiding places in the Normandy home. It consisted of 5,000 pieces, two bars and 37 ingots of gold.\\nNow read: The largest gold nuggets ever found\\nSpeaking of unusual wills, a family who inherited a garage in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, were shocked to discover it contained this super-rare car. The 1937 Bugatti 57S was discovered in the garage in 2007, after the passing of 89-year old Dr Harold Carr, along with a Classic Aston Martin, a Jaguar E-Type and a Type 57S Atalante. To the family\\'s delight, the car sold for a staggering £3 million ($4.3m) in February 2009.\\nBetween 1985 and 1988, workers in the Polish town of Środa Śląska uncovered a hoard of gold and silver coins and precious jewels during a renovation project on an abandoned telephone exchange. The treasure, which includes this medieval gold crown, was confiscated by the authorities. It was valued at a massive $100+ million (£53m) in 2005.\\nNow read about the \\'treasures\\' that turned out to be worthless\\nThis rusty sword, which dates back to between 600 and 800 BC, was found by farmer Ambrose Owens in 1965 on the banks of the Arney River in Northern Ireland. Not realising its significance, Owens dumped it in his barn, where it remained for more than 50 years. Owens\\' brother Maurice rediscovered the artefact in July 2016, and had it appraised by experts – only to discover it was a priceless 2,600-year old artefact!\\nNow discover some amazingly valuable treasures that were bought for peanuts',\n",
       " 'Looking for the perfect Siberian Husky dog name for the newest addition to your family? Adopting a new furry family member is as exciting as it is stressful! Not only will you need to buy the right toys for your Husky, but you’ll also need to get them the perfectly-sized Husky harness and feed them a properly balanced Husky dog food. As if this is not enough to think about, finding the perfect name for your pup is often one of the things a new dog owner frequently struggles with.\\nIf the dog you’re adopting happens to be a Husky, you have the added pressure of choosing a name suitable for both their heritage and their personality. If you’re not one to stick to what everyone else is doing, that’s okay. There are plenty of other sources of names for your new Husky friend. You can look at popular culture, books, movies, TV shows, music, and more. You can also look into the heritage of the Husky breed to find the perfect name.\\nHuskies are one of the most commonly used dogs in mushing, which can be an excellent source of inspiration for a name. Huskies are also known for their stubbornness, loyalty, and intelligence. They often outsmart their owners and get out of situations that you wouldn’t expect your average Fido to figure out. You can take these things into account when trying out names. Even if you’ve adopted a Siberian Husky mix, many of these names will work just as well for your mutt. Let’s find the perfect name for your Siberian Husky pup!\\nPopular Siberian Husky Names\\nAn easy jumping-off point for finding Husky names is looking up the most popular options. Similar to naming other popular breeds like the German Shepherd, there are plenty of commonly used names for Siberian Huskies, both male and female. Some people don’t mind if their Siberian Husky’s name is a little more common, especially if it fits their personality.\\nHumans often look to the world of music when choosing a name for a new baby, and that same approach can be applied to finding pet names. Choosing a name based on your favorite band or song is a great idea, but make sure that name makes sense with a Husky regarding breed norms. Musicians and their tunes can make a great name for your Husky, provided their personality fits the name. There are endless options for male and female Husky dog names that come from music.\\nAs we mentioned with musical names, finding a name in a book that is synonymous with intelligence, class, or stubbornness makes a lot more sense for your Husky than just choosing any old character. Huskies are fierce but also loyal and loveable. Take the personality of your dog into account when selecting a literary namesake. Of course, you can always pick a name from a book or character that means something special to you and share that love with your new Husky pup.\\nFilm & TV-Inspired Names\\nFilm and television-inspired names are fun and a great way to find unique and nostalgic names for both male and female Huskies. It’s possible that naming a dog after a TV show or movie will result in your pup’s name becoming an oddity down the road, but for some owners, that is just part of the charm. Names from popular, multi-season shows or classic movies are easy to recognize, but there are also plenty of names in lesser-known pieces. Some owners would argue that the most appropriate name on the TV and movies list for your Husky is the last one, given MacGyver’s notoriously quick thinking and ability to get out of almost any situation.\\nHuskies are similar to MacGyver in how they think since they are known for escaping their crates, fences, and anything else standing between them and their freedom or doggy dreams. We’ve compiled a list of our very favorite names based on TV and movies to help you name your beautiful pup.\\nAlaskan Sled Dog Names\\nWhen it comes to naming your dog, it’s sometimes nice to honor their heritage or what makes them popular. Huskies are synonymous with sled dogs and mushing, which means naming your husky after a popular sled dog or mushing term might be a great choice. We’ve come up with 20 names that honor your Husky’s sled dog heritage for your consideration.\\nHuman-Inspired Dog Names\\nSometimes no traditional dog names sound right for your fur baby, and that’s okay. It’s becoming more and more popular to name dogs using traditionally human names. This trend probably has something to do with our greater societal trend toward treating dogs as full-fledged members of the family, but we can’t say for sure.\\nRegardless of the reason for choosing a human name for your Husky, we’ve come up with 20 incredible options to help you narrow down your search.\\nMaybe you want to give your talented and intelligent dog a name associated with a true champion. If that’s the case, you can always choose a name from the sports world. The world of sports offers popular inspiration for many dog owners, so thinking through your favorite player or sports team is always a great option. The sports world provides vast inspiration for male and female Husky dog names.\\nWolf Ancestry-Inspired Names\\nOne thing that makes Huskies unique is how closely they still resemble wolves. You can use that heritage to find the perfect Siberian Husky dog name by looking into names that mean wolf in other languages or relate to wolf characters in pop culture. A wolf-like dog name might be the perfect fit. We’ve come up with 20 names associated with wolves to round out our top 200 Husky names.\\nSiberian Husky Naming Tips\\nNaming a dog is both a science and an art. You’ll need to understand some basics about dog behavior, but you’ll also want to feel the emotions and see the beauty and strength in the name you choose. There’s a lot to learn before you take on the task of finding the perfect Siberian Husky dog name.\\nTip #1: Syllables Matter\\nExperts recommend using two-syllable names to add inflections that are more difficult with single-syllable names easily. For example, if your dog’s name is Paisley, you can emphasize the “Pais” portion with upward inflection and then slide your tone down on the “ley” portion to show affection.\\nTip #2: Kit Sounds Like Sit\\nYou should also avoid names that sound like basic commands. For example, you’ll notice confusion in your dog early on if you choose to name it Cake and then try to teach it to shake.\\nTip #3: The Back Door Test\\nFinally, we recommend the “back door test” for your Siberian Husky dog name. Narrow down your list of names using other criteria, and then take your favorites to the back door. You’ll literally yell the names out the door to test and see if you like saying them out loud. The back door test helps to eliminate any awkward or inappropriate names before you bring the dog home.\\nRemember, Huskies are highly intelligent, stubborn, and loyal. They are working dogs and get bored easily. Try to choose a name that honors their personalities or heritage in some way. Every dog is unique, so you’ll probably want to meet them before settling on the perfect Siberian Husky dog name.\\nHusky names don’t have to have any connection to sled dogs or Alaska, but they can if you’d like. You can also base your dog’s name on your favorite activities, sports heroes, or even your dog’s size, which is always fun when naming a bigger dog. Naming your Siberian Husky after other physical traits, like their blue eyes, can also make great names. This is one of the best parts of owning a dog – naming it is entirely up to you!\\nNaming a dog is an art in that you can pull inspiration from anywhere. It’s also a science in that there are ways to help your dog respond faster and create a stronger connection. Utilizing both sides of the naming process will help you choose the best name possible for your Husky.\\nShare The Infographic Below On Your Site',\n",

       " 'DEARBORN, Mich., July 16, 2019 – Ford and Roush Performance today unveil the 2019 “Old Crow” Mustang GT, a charity collaboration project which pays homage to World War II triple ace pilot Colonel Bud Anderson of the U.S. Army Air Force and the legendary P-51 Mustang fighter planes he flew in combat – nicknamed “Old Crow.”\\nThis one-of-one Mustang will be auctioned at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s 2019 AirVenture air show on July 25 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

A custom Roush grille with P-51 Mustang badge adorns the front, the words “Old Crow” are written on the hood and an authentic Eighth Air Force emblem badge adorns the decklid panel.\\nPerformance in the “Old Crow” Mustang GT comes by way of a Ford and Roush Performance TVS R2650 supercharger, which boosts the 5.0-liter V8 engine to 710 horsepower and 610 lb.-ft. of torque. Other performance upgrades include a Roush Performance cold air induction system and X pipe, plus a custom active exhaust system from Ford Performance.\\nThe “Old Crow” Mustang uses Ford’s MagneRide® damping system and puts power to the ground through a set of custom 20-inch lightweight Roush wheels wrapped in 275/35R Continental ExtremeContact sport tires.\\nExterior enhancements include Roush rear fascia aerofoils, Ford Performance front racing spoiler, 2020 Mustang Shelby® GT500® rear spoiler, custom heat extractors on the hood and blue rainbow tinted exhaust tips that emulate the exhaust on the P-51 Mustang planes.\\nInside the cabin, a fully custom, aircraft-inspired interior features unique military-themed green leather and canvas and red shifter nob and door handles. “P-51” is written on the passenger-side dashboard.

Anderson achieved more than 16 aerial victories in Europe during World War II. He flew 116 combat missions, including a six-hour mission on D-Day.

       " 'Vrooom…Jawa & Yezdi Bikes proudly Ridden by Owners Mark 17th International Jawa Day in City\\nMangaluru :Jawa and Yezdi bikes, which had ruled the roads way back in the 70s and the 80s, vroomed in and around Panambur Beach- Mangaluru to mark 17th International Jawa Day this Sunday morning (8 July), amidst rain and shine. Every year, people all around the world, get together and get their beloved Czech made motorcycles – the indomitable proud JAWA, or Czech-inspired motorcycles such as the YEZDI in India – out on the roads ! Why you may ask? Well its a day when the owners and riders would love to show off their possessions, show the world that these grand machines – that possibly once ruled the roads, not just in India, but in countries of Europe, as well as other continents – are still in use and after all these years, can still mark their presence.\\nOn the lighter side, some feel that the owners all round the world would like to make a circle of blue smoke, if just for a little while. But whatever it is, some like to ride in groups, some like to ride solo, some prefer to have city based events – its all a gathering of people and public, who can appreciate those beauties from an era gone by. Close to 80 bikes, including 14 from Bengaluru, 50 from Mangaluru, 18 from Udupi, 2 from Mysuru, 1 each from Moodbidri, Kasargod, Madikeri (rode by a female), and Puttur, converged at the Panambur Beach Parking area, with special emphasis on Road Safety Awareness complete with a quiz programme, competitions and a presentation, to help educate the members of the Motorcycling Community of the importance of Road Safety in their daily lives.\\nBack in 2003, when the idea of having an International Jawa Day, by the Jawa CZ Owners Club in the UK, was first born – with the thought of showing everybody that “look, these motorcycles are still in use, and people still love riding them”, they might have never thought that in the very second year, the fever had already spread across continents to the Czech Republic, Germany, the US, South Africa, Australia and Canada ,even if it was just 3 -5 serious riders. They might never have thought that in the 17th International Jawa Day, the numbers would have shot dramatically to such an extent, that India itself was religiously celebrating in almost all major cities and metros – today – the 14th July – the name Jawa & Yezdi that has stubbornly stood against all odds, so much so that the Jawa made its presence felt in the market, with its new-gen bikes, that still felt like Classics!\\nMaybe bigger cities like Bengaluru have the opportunity and the numbers that made them anticipate around 700 Jawa & Yezdi motorcycles in their Jawa Day celebrations. But cities like Mangaluru and Udupi, are no less, even if their numbers are small. As per Shawn Fernandez, the coordinator of Mangaluru Jawa Yezdi Motorcyle Club, “The Udupi Jawa Yezdi Motorcycle Club (U.J.Y.M.C.) decided to have their celebrations on Saturday evening – the 13th July and invitations were sent to all clubs and friends and riders around. For this, around 11 members from the Mangalore Club, got ready at 1.30 pm and rode out in the rain to join their friends in Udupi. With their prominent chief guests from the Manipal Auto Club, among others, the entire event was well taken care off, especially since they stressed on the importance of Helmets and other safety aspects. There would have been easily around 45 Jawa & Yezdi motorcycles for this evening session, following which the Mangaluru riders all rode back together!”\\nBut on Sunday morning, for one, the riders from Bengaluru, part of the Kings Raid team, had decided to ride down and be a part of the celebrations in both the twin cities. Together with them a couple of riders from Mysore and Madikeri had also come down, plus a team from Udupi were on their way by now. By around 8.30 am, the venue was ready and available at Panambur Beach parking, thanks to a number of key people. Refreshments were served to all, following which, as soon as the 18 + member riding team from Udupi had joined in, mementoes were handed over to the Circle Inspector Mohan and his associate Raghavendra, Yatish Bykampady, Director of the Panambur Beach Development Authority Project and his close friend Raju, A warm welcome was given to all riders, especially the out-of-town ones.\\nWithout wasting time, what immediately followed was an interesting session, compered by Ahmed – a rider from Bengaluru, who was technical based and had in-depth knowledge about these motorcycles. Common issues and problems faced by riders and owners were discussed and questions and answers went back and forth, making it quite an interesting session. When the rains came down, and pushed everybody back into the Golden Reef restaurant, the outdoor activities were kept on hold and instead, a dumb charade combination was held under the shelter. Five teams were selected and each team was given 2 minutes to speak about any particular item of importance. While one person would explain details, importance and need of this, the other person would enact the dialogue, mono acting style.\\nThis of course led to quite a hilarious display of explanations, but the key riders who took first place were Vinay and Keshav from the Bangalore team, on their demonstration of helmets and riding gears, while riding! The rains gave a respite and the people were once again ready for the next round outdoors.\\nEvent 1 – Push your bike – as a team -……..backwards – this showed the importance of teamwork together with skills. The bike faces in the reverse direction and the pillion rider also faces backwards. On cue, they set off, pushing the bike with their legs on the ground, while firmly seated and the rider who is seated facing forward has to navigate using his skills and the directions of his pillion rider. The winners here were riders from the Jawa tribe – the new gen 4-stroke 300 cc motorcycles, Ajesh and Sachin.\\nEvent 2 – the evergreen slow race, but different categories for both new as well as old bikes. Roshan Shetty from Udupi won first place in the old Jawa & Yezdi motorcycles, while Ajesh won in the new-gen motorcycles. Prize winners were awarded mementos, together with riders from other cities who had come in. A total of around 80 motorcycles were present, among which were 6 – Old Jawa 250 and 1 Jawa 350 – one of the oldest Jawas was a 1966 model, immaculately owned by Prem Rasquinha, complete with snow guards; 2 – Yezdi 350s; 9 – new Jawas and Jawa 42’s assorted models of the Ideal Jawa Company from Mysuru – B-type, D250 Classic, Deluxe 250, Cl 11s, Roadkings.\\nThe event ended on a high note – with all riders lining up and riding out in single formation, so as not to inconvenience the public as well as locals, while heading towards Chitrapur Beach, Kulur, where everybody lined up together for a group picture against the beauty of the stormy beach, before everybody dispersed towards their respective places! Definitely a day well spent – that was the 17th International Yezdi Jawa Day celebrated in fun and frolic in the vicinity of Panambur Beach! !\\nWith inputs from Shawn fernandez- coordinator of Mangaluru Jawa Yezdi Motorcyle Club',\n",

       " 'Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.\\n~ Donald Knuth\\nYou’ll never appreciate the true complexity of a mundane, everyday task, until you’ve tried explaining it to a computer.\\nContrary to popular perception, computers are not smart. Actually, they are stone dumb. Given a lengthy set of precise instructions, your computer can follow them well enough, most of the time, but when asked to exhibit the tiniest bit of reasoning or creativity, your cutting-edge laptop PC is helpless and hopeless. Ditto for the Mac. Sorry, Linux won’t help either.\\nConsider the simple act of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You can teach the average six year-old child this skill in a few minutes; writing the equivalent instructions for a general-purpose computer could literally take weeks or months of effort.\\nKnowing all this, I was amazed by the concept and promise of Spike TV’s new show, Deadliest Warrior:\\nIn Los Angeles, CA, we’ve created a high-tech fight club, with scientists, martial arts experts, and lots and lots of weapons. It’s all here to create a virtual battle between two legendary warriors. We’ll test their weapons and fighting techniques on high-tech dummies—stand-ins for human victims. Based on this data, a battle simulation program will stage a true-to-life fight to the death. The winner will be The Deadliest Warrior.\\nCould it possibly be true? Would the endless debates over the ultimate fighting style finally be put to rest, by indisputable scientific evidence?\\nAs it turns out, Deadliest Warrior devotes the majority of its screen time to slashing, stabbing and smashing test dummies with period weapons. The remainder is split between historical reenactment scenes, and bull sessions with their resident martial arts historians. Sadly, for those of us with an interest in the simulator itself, the show never describes its operation.\\nSlitherine Software UK, creators of Deadliest Warrior’s battle modeler, would not agree to an interview. So instead, I will take a wild stab at assessing how the software works, and whether it meets its promise as a scientific and objective judge of human warriors.\\nThe Genesis of the Deadliest Warrior Sim\\nAccording to the SpikeTV’s producers, a team of programmers spent five years developing the Deadliest Warrior simulation engine. This is not precisely correct. Slitherine Software created a real-time strategy game—The History Channel’s Great Battles of Rome—and later tweaked this game for the specific use of the Deadliest Warrior program.\\nGreat Battles of Rome is a role-playing game, with some references to true historical events. It does not, and is not intended to simulate the reality of ancient warfare in authentic detail. As in other RTS games, the game player serves as general over an army of semi-autonomous battle units, each possessing unique strengths, weaknesses, and methods of attack. Play consists of directing strategy and tactics, advance and retreat, to capture territory and defeat the forces of the opponent.\\nTroop types in GBoR include light and heavy infantry, archers, cavalry and war elephants. Cavalry presumably move faster than elephants, but are less powerful against a lone soldier; archers can attack safely from longer distances, but are handicapped by forest terrain; and so on.\\nThese game rules were reworked for use on Deadliest Warrior. Instead of pitting two groups of one thousand warriors against each other in one giant battle, the software matches up two single warriors—an archetypal ninja and Spartan, or samurai and Viking raider—for one thousand consecutive matches.\\nWhy repeat the same match one thousand times? Why can’t this high-tech computer simulation compute the correct results on the first try? The simple answer is that neither the simulation, nor its creators know how to do so.\\nEnter the Monte Carlo algorithm. Instead of dictating fixed values for each fighter’s metrics—their speed and agility, the range and power of their weapons, et cetera—the programmers define a range of possible values. The computer then runs a series of test cases, using random numbers that fall within those ranges. After sufficient test cases have been run, the computer aggregates the results to guess the most probable real-life conclusion.\\nWith a random number generator determining the outcome of these battles, one might assume fairness and objectivity; but that would be a mistake. Underneath the Deadliest Warrior’s fancy wire-frame graphics and state-of-the-art ballistic weapons measurements, lies a set of flawed assumptions that destroy the show’s claims to scientific validity.\\nNinja vs. Spartan\\nAs any experienced martial artist can tell you, the fighting tactics shown in the final reenactments are laughable. On the show, “computer whiz” Max Geiger explains these episodes as dramatized composites of a sober statistical analysis; but in fact, the analysis itself is probably no closer to reality.\\nRandom numbers alone do not make a battle. Remember that the computer does not know how to fight, nor is it capable of learning this independently. In the end, it can only follow instructions.\\nCan you guess who wrote those instructions? (I’ll give you a hint: it wasn’t the International Ninja Council.)\\nUltimately, these “scientific rules” of warfare were written not by experienced warriors, but by a group of programmers; and with the initial constraint that they should be simple enough to produce an entertaining computer game (Great Battles of Rome).\\nTheoretically, the Monte Carlo method might compensate for the programmers’ inability to identify the single most important factor in these warriors’ battle. (If we knew the answer to that question, there would be no need for a simulation.) Instead, they attempted to identify twenty different factors that could affect the outcome, and all the paths through which these factors can interact. In other words, they attempted to reduce mastery of the martial arts to a straightforward mathematical equation, and draw “scientific” conclusions from the use of that equation.\\nUnderstand that the art of fighting is not an output from this simulation; it is an input. It is not an experimental result, but a set of assertions written by software engineers. Whether or not these assertions are prima facie reasonable is irrelevant; dojo novices quickly learn that “reasonable” is not a working martial art. (Incidentally, this may explain why no computer scientists have yet won a UFC title.)\\nConsidering the hidden complexity of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you might assume that a proper martial arts simulator would require many years of careful design, with input from experts in the fields of software engineering and martial arts. You would be correct.\\nDoes Spike TV’s Deadliest Warrior reflect this disciplined approach to the intractable problem of single combat?\\nI can answer that in three words: severed pig carcasses.',\n",
       " 'Rewriting History, Wiki Style\\nMartial arts are systems of codified practices and traditions of training for combat. While they maybe studied for various reasons, martial arts share a single objective: to defeat a person physically or to defend oneself from physical threat.\\nWikipedia’s simplistic definition begs the question: martial arts are martial arts. The statement itself is neither true nor untrue—it is a game rule—but it does reflect an ignorance of, or perhaps a malevolence towards historical facts. Taken at face value, it encourages a dismissive, one-dimensional analysis of the arts’ tremendous potential.\\nTo avoid limiting our achievement in the martial arts, we should begin with an honest and dispassionate accounting of the past. What was the real original purpose of various “martial arts”?\\nThe first clues may be found in our forefathers’ own speech and writings.',\n",
       " 'Open Container Law in Texas\\nThe current open container law in Texas was part of a push to make the laws around drinking and driving stricter. Moreover, they had to comply with the Federal Transportation Equity Act to ensure the state received funding.\\nFor over a decade, there have been no significant changes to the open container law. However, many Texans remain confused about what the law covers. When you receive an open container ticket in Houston, TX, it’s not always easy to navigate the legal system.\\nWith an experienced criminal defense attorney, you have someone to guide you through it. Schedule a free case evaluation today to learn more.\\nWhat Is an Open Container?\\nThe term “open container” seems simple at first. However, the penal code is not so easy to interpret. The Texas Penal Code, Title 10, § 49.031 covers possession of an alcoholic beverage in a motor vehicle.\\nPer the penal code, a person commits this offense when they knowingly possess an open container in the passenger area of a vehicle on a public highway. This applies whether the vehicle is in transit, stopped, or parked.\\nFor many Texas, the open container law leaves them with many questions.\\n- Can a passenger have an open container or is that against the law, too?\\n- Does an open container ticket go on your record?\\n- If the open container is in the trunk, is that illegal?\\n- Is it legal to drive with an open container of alcohol anywhere in the car?\\n- What are the consequences if I unintentionally violate this law as a driver or passenger?\\nAt first, you might think you understand what qualifies as an open container, public highway, and passenger area. However, many Texas drivers don’t realize that these laws are stricter than many believe.\\nFor instance, “open container” applies to a bottle, flask, or other container with any level of alcohol in it that is currently open or has been opened. Put simply, a previously opened bottle of whiskey counts under the open container law in Texas.\\nThe only exclusions are containers that have never been opened or still have an intact factory seal.\\nWhat Counts as the “Passenger Area”?\\nThe “passenger area” of this law is also a point of confusion. Essentially, any area where a container of alcohol is visible to the driver and within reach counts. However, the law specifically excludes open containers in the following areas.\\n- A locked glove compartment\\n- The trunk\\n- Areas behind the back row of seats in cars without trunks\\nLastly, while the penal code refers to “public highways” specifically, this includes more than interstates and freeways. In reality, it applies to any container on a publicly maintained road.\\nAdditionally, it includes areas immediately around any public road. So, if you park on a quiet back road, it’s possible to violate this law.\\nWhat Are the Penalties of the Open Container Law in Texas?\\nOn its own, possession of an open container in a vehicle is a Class C misdemeanor. The base penalties include a fine of up to $500. It carries no mandatory jail time.\\nSo long as you and your passengers violate no other laws, you receive a ticket and pay a fine. However, a violation of the open container law enhances the penalties of other crimes.\\nFor instance, if you face DWI charges, an open container in your vehicle increases the fines and jail time you face. Oftentimes, we refer to this as an “open container enhancement.”\\nIn such a case, this violation of the open container law is open to treatment as a Class B misdemeanor. This level of misdemeanor carries fines of up to $2,000 with potential jail time of up to 180 days.\\nSimilarly, if you receive a charge for an open container while on DWI probation or with a suspended driver’s license, the potential penalties grow yet more severe. No matter the penalty, it’s important to understand how far-reaching the consequences can be.\\nWhile the state’s punishment is limited to a relatively minute fine, it goes on your record. Often, this has a negative impact on academic and career pursuits. For example, you might have a harder time attaining financial aid.\\nAdditionally, many employers check criminal records. Moreover, when you need a professional license or security clearance, these records come under consideration. Lastly, car insurance companies often consider people with open container law convictions a higher risk. That leads to higher monthly premiums.\\nFighting an Open Container Charge\\nWhether you face basic open container charges or an enhancement to your DWI, you have an opportunity to fight the charge. If an officer pulls you over, the law requires that they have reasonable suspicion and sufficient cause to search your vehicle.\\nIf your charges stem from an illegal stop or an unlawful search, you need an experienced criminal defense attorney on your side. At The Martinez Law Firm, our DWI defense attorneys have a great deal of experience and expertise.

       " 'Photo: Martin at his desk, March 2009, from the film The Rescuers\\n800 words / 4 minute read\\nFrom my first days as Churchill’s biographer in 1968 I began to receive letters from people who wanted to tap my imagined expertise. Sometimes I get as many as a dozen such letters a week. Most people want me to confirm a Churchill story or to verify a quotation. This, though seemingly simple, can take hours, even if it can be done at all. Auction houses seek confirmation that a Churchill signature being offered for sale is genuine (it is surprising how often it is not). Many of those who write to me hope that I may be able to date a photograph, or to identify the people who appear on either side of Churchill. Some want to know if Churchill stayed at their homes, or had some connection with their region or their professional work, with a view to putting up a plaque.\\nEvery facet of Churchill’s life, from the most profound to the most bizarre, has crossed my desk in the form of queries. The most frequent are about his cigars, his brandy and his cats.\\nA few of those who wrote to me claimed to be Churchill’s illegitimate children. Several others asked me to confirm that Brendan Bracken, his friend and wartime Minister of Information, was such a child. In no case did illegitimacy seem at all possible, despite the uncertainty of paternity. I was able to give a decisive reply to the woman who said that Churchill and her mother had had an illicit liaison (Churchill had then been a married man for seven years) on board a troopship in the eastern Mediterranean in the summer of 1915, nine months before her birth. Throughout that summer Churchill had been in London and, at weekends, at Hoe Farm near Godalming, in Surrey.\\nThe desire to have some link with Churchill in distant lands was a regular feature of enquiries. When I was in the Crimea in 1989, I was offered a trip to “the grave of Churchill’s father”, killed in action, it seems, during the Battle of Balaclava in 1854, twenty years before Churchill’s birth, and buried within sight of the Black Sea. In fact, Lord Randolph had died in London in 1895, and was buried at Bladon, within sight of the towers of Blenheim Palace. Also in 1989, as the Soviet Union turned from communism to glasnost, the Lvov Medical Institute, a branch of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, asked the British Embassy in Moscow to confirm that Churchill had gone to the Carpathian spa town of Skole in the 1930s “with the aim of restoring his health”. A new medical centre was being developed there; no doubt the institute had hoped to put up a plaque: “Britain’s war leader took the waters here,” a good advertisement in the changing times. But there was no evidence that Churchill had gone anywhere in Europe east of Munich in the 1930s, let alone into deepest then-Polish Galicia.\\nIn 1985 I was approached by the Attorney-General’s office of Alberta, Canada. The province was seeking to put on trial a teacher who, in denouncing the malign influence of the Jews, had quoted Churchill as an authority. The quotation he used was well known to me, and as it was also taken out of context, I was able to provide the court with the full quotation, and an explanation of Churchill’s views.\\nAs cited by the teacher, Churchill had denounced the Bolshevik Jews controlling the Soviet regime in 1920, and had likened them to a worldwide “sinister conspiracy” of Jews who worked to undermine democracy. Churchill’s actual article, published in the Illustrated Sunday Herald of 8 February 1920, had set out his thoughts on three very different types of Jewish involvement in national life: the Bolshevik involvement, which he abhorred; the assimilationists, of whom he approved; and the Zionists, about whom he wrote with both fervour and prescience: “If, as may happen, there should be created in our lifetime, by the banks of the Jordan, a Jewish state under the protection of the British crown, which might comprise three or four millions of Jews, an event would have occurred in the history of the world which would, from every point of view, be beneficial.” This was written in 1930. In 1992 the Jewish population of the State of Israel reached four million.\\nThe queries of readers, fellow historians, other writers and even schoolchildren stimulate the search and keep the focus sharp. Churchill will always be the object of curiosity and controversy. To every enquiry there is an answer and to every controversy there is a truth. It is the search for truth that has made the quest so exhilarating. I suppose that letters will keep reaching me long after my Churchill pen is laid to rest. I shall certainly not complain if this is so.\\nAn excerpt from In Search of Churchill\\nRead: In Search of Churchill',\n",

       " 'The year is 1960, and the scene is Great Falls, Montana. A real town which, like Richard Russo’s fictional Empire Falls, Maine, seems chosen for the irony in the name given the story to be told. The protagonist and narrator here is Dell Parsons, a fifteen-year-old boy who is earnest but rootless, with a father in the military whose rank isn’t what it once was, a twin sister who’s light years ahead of him developmentally but lacks his passion for school or chess, and a mother and part-time schoolteacher who is hostage to her lowly and itinerant circumstances. “We were a family who didn’t travel,” Dell tells us, “unless we were moving to a new town.”\\nThe general contours of the disaster to come, we learn on page one:\\n“First, I’ll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later. The robbery is the more important part, since it served to set my and my sister’s lives on the courses they eventually followed. Nothing would make complete sense without that being told first.”\\nThis is confident, even audacious storytelling—not because it’s showy, but because it refuses to show off at all. In the early going, Ford leaps forward on occasion, teasing out what’s coming, sometimes narrating from the perspective of an earnest fifteen-year-old, other times with the benefit of adult hindsight. Some of this is hardly even noticeable, and all of it works.\\nTo some extent the suspense lies in how these crimes will come to be committed. But far more than this, the story is driven by how these events come to shape a young man trying to find his way in a young life; how he sees what is happening to his family and himself; and what he makes of life under extreme circumstances, after he’s driven by his aunt north across the border to avoid becoming a ward of the state. There he lives with shady characters in a sparsely populated backwater that has a lodge where Americans come to hunt ducks and Dell works for his keep. Dell makes of it what he can.\\n“It would never be a place with big oak trees and a football field and boys my age to accept me—the way I’d almost had it in Great Falls. This would never be what I wanted. It was Canada.”\\nDell’s father, Bev Parsons, is a man burdened by limitless imagination, endless optimism and an astonishing lack of judgment, who finds a silver lining in any omen. When the bank he cased for a heist at nine o’clock one morning turns out to be far busier than he’d seen before on the day in question, he convinces himself all this will serve as some grand diversion. Needless to say, it doesn’t.\\nThe first of two or three beautiful endings—at the close of Part One, two hundred pages in—has Dell’s twin sister leaving the house after their parents are jailed and nobody’s yet come to take them away.\\n“To concentrate on Berner leaving would make all this seem to be about loss—which isn’t how I think about it to this very day. I think of it as being about progress, and the future, which aren’t always easy to see when you’re so close to both of them.”\\nPart Two begins shortly thereafter and just in time, with a friend of their mother coming to take Dell before the child welfare services people descend. She drives him north for hours, crossing the border and dropping him into his new life. He grows up in a hurry, and meets some indelible characters in a once-grand duck-hunting lodge, though the parts Dell lives in are spartan to say the least. The grand character at the center of it, one Arthur Remlinger, owns the lodge and his own mysterious background, which has him living so far from anything that feels like civilization or normal life. Dell will finish growing up here, and one wonders what will become of him.\\nIn Part Three we meet the adult Dell has become, a middle-aged secondary school teacher in Canada. We learn what he’s made of all that went on before, and what’s become of his twin sister, who has lived a lowly life and taken their father’s name, Bev, as hers some years back.

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO, CA — May 1, 2012 – With Mitt Romney now the presumptive Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election, Maven, the Global Knowledge Marketplace, has released the results of its most recent presidential election tracking survey. The results show the power of the incumbency weighing heavily in Obama’s favor.\\nNational polls published last week showed Obama and Romney almost dead even. However, Maven’s fifth survey of political insiders shows Barack Obama with a commanding lead, beating Romney by nearly 40 percent on the queston of who is likely to win in November.\\nIn the Maven survey, 69 percent of respondents believed that Barack Obama will win reelection in November 2012, up from 60 percent in the January survey and 48 percent in the October survey. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, who was neck and neck with Obama in October, slipped to 31 percent in April.\\nThe survey’s respondents included political consultants, lobbyists, and government relations professionals from Maven’s extensive microconsulting network.\\n“Perhaps the most interesting outcome of this month’s survey is the fact that slightly over half of all respondents indicated that they voted for John McCain in 2008 – and nearly half of them believe that Obama will win this year,” commented Maven Co-Founder and CEO Wyatt Nordstrom. “ In other words, Republican insiders seem to believe that Romney will lose. Whether this is the result of lingering sour grapes over their preferred Republican candidates’ primary losses to Romney or a true indication of serious doubts of Romney’s ability to confront Obama remains to be seen.”\\nAs in previous surveys, participants were asked to comment on the reasons for their selections. Highlights include:\\n- Respondents cited the power of an incumbent President as the main reason Obama will be re-elected in 2012. One respondent summed it up as follows:\\nObama enjoys the benefits of incumbency. He has no significant opposition in his party’s nomination process, and is therefore able to raise money for use in the general election rather than versus primary opponents. Even with the Republican Party’s nomination effectively decided, that party has not yet coalesced around its candidate, and is unlikely to really do so before the fall.\\nAnother respondent added:\\nThe power of incumbency brings with it percentage points – perhaps 5 – of advantage almost by default. If oil prices go down, economic trends continue to improve, and more troops are brought home, the incumbent is nearly a lock. The presumed challenger does not bring enough enthusiasm, particularly from the most conservative blocks, to sway enough voters to create an upset in 2012 barring unforeseen changes.\\n- An additional factor – Obama’s fundraising skills – was cited as a reason for an Obama victory, according to the political Mavens surveyed. One Maven said it this way:\\nI believe Obama will have a sufficient money advantage and will once again show his skill as a good campaigner to win reelection. I do not feel the Republicans will field a candidate with the appeal to overcome the Obama ‘mystique.’\\nAnother respondent added:\\nObama will likely win both the popular and delegate votes. He spends much time and money on campaigning and most of his base will vote in the same fashion.\\n- On the contrary, others predicted that Romney will win the general election due to lingering economic and other domestic issues. As one respondent noted:\\nThe present state of the economy and lack of recovery will negate President Obama’s popularity… Romney has a more concise energy plan. He understands that we need to develop a comprehensive energy policy…\\nThe economic recovery will continue to be sluggish through the fall. Many independent voters are looking for an alternative to President Obama, and will support the challenger if they can be persuaded that he can meet a baseline competence threshold.”\\nThis is the fifth in a series of surveys conducted by Maven leading up to the November 2012 election. Results are tracked to illustrate how sentiment among the respondent population changes as events unfold.\\nMembers of the news media interested in speaking with the Survey respondents should contact Maven at email@example.com.\\nMaven is a global network of industry professionals, thought leaders, and experts who connect, share knowledge, and help each other address business challenges of all sizes. Maven’s proprietary “microconsulting” platform provides instant access to highly qualified experts from every background via paid knowledge sharing interactions, including:\\n- Telephone Consultations\\n- Electronic Surveys\\n- Extended Consulting Projects\\n- Intelligence Markets\\n- Business Education Workshops & Seminars\\n- Strategic Advisory\\n- Knowledge Communities, powered by Maven\\nMaven – Faster Insights.

This summer we want to run TWO CAMPS !!!\\nBoth camps will be for 4 days (3 nights) at Rotbav in the county Brasov.\\n- The first is for children (aged 7-11) and will take place between 18th and 21st July\\n- The second is for teens (aged 12-15) and will take place between 1st and 4th August\\nWhy are we running two camps this year?\\nThe simple answer is that there are more children! The work has grown over 5 years! In years gone by we raised money to take children and teens from Bodesti away each summer. While this was great for them, there were children in other places where we work that were not able to go on a camp.\\nThe vision this year is to have two age-related camps that each accommodate up to 34 children from Bodesti, Bargauani and Piatra Neamt. This way, all children who come regularly to our weekly programs will have an opportunity to go on a camp.\\nWhy do we do camps?\\nIt would be far easier to sit at home this summer and relax! Running a camp is really hard work. But we do it...\\n- To give poor children a chance to have a holiday (many children in the villages never go away on family holidays)\\n- Because the Bible tells us to scatter abroad our gifts to the poor (Psalm 112 v 9), that faith should be accompanied by action especially towards the poor (James 2 v 17), and that Jesus loves children! (Luke 18 v 19)\\n- To build relationships between children, between leaders, and between children and leaders\\n- To have a unique time in which the Bible message can be shared with young lives\\n- To strengthen the ongoing work with children and their families in the places we work\\n- To work together (both here in Romania and also with churches and supporters across the globe)\\nHow can you get involved?\\nIt is wonderful that we can achieve such projects together! Sharing the load makes it easier for the individual to contribute and make a difference! You can share in this project together by helping us with the following:\\n- Praying for these two camps, for preparation, leaders, participants, accommodation, travel, activities, finance, welfare etc\\n- Giving financially (see below)\\n- Inspiring us with ideas of how we can fundraise here as a church on the ground in Romania\\n- Sharing this email with somebody else\\nHow much do we need to raise and how are we going to do it?\\nEach camp will cost about 2,500 Euros. That includes transport, accommodation, food, activities and all the necessary materials. In total, we need to raise 5,000 Euros. How do we plan to do this? There are 4 ways:\\n- The money the Church has already received\\n- Admission fees. We are going to ask children who can, to contribute something towards their own cost\\n- Local fundraising\\n- Support from overseas\",\n",

       " 'Transcatheter interventions get more love in updated valvular heart disease guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA).\\nPatients with severe aortic stenosis who have choices for intervention should be included in shared decision-making that considers the lifetime risks and benefits associated with type of valve and type of approach, according to a class I recommendation in the guideline, published online in Circulation.\\nThat said, when aortic valve replacement is indicated, the surgical approach continues to be recommended for most groups. Notable exceptions are people age 65-80 years for whom shared decision-making is emphasized, and people over 80 years old (or younger patients with short life expectancy) for whom transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now recommended.\\n\"Current research and new technology continue to transform the treatment of heart valve disease, as updated lifestyle and medication guidance evolve, and less invasive procedures have replaced traditional surgery for many patients,\" said guideline writing committee co-chair Catherine Otto, MD, of the University of Washington in Seattle, in a press release.\\nWith the new guideline, ACC/AHA reviewers incorporated evidence from 2019 that people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk have clinical outcomes that are on par with or even better than surgery. The indication for low-risk TAVR was FDA approved within months of the PARTNER 3 and Evolut Low Risk trial presentations.\\nGuideline authors noted that the timing of treatment for aortic stenosis should be based primarily on symptoms or reduced ventricular systolic function. For some with severe aortic stenosis but no symptoms, aortic valve replacement may be reasonable.\\nAs for people with valvular regurgitation, Otto\\'s group determined that the indications for intervention are for symptom relief and prevention of the irreversible long-term consequences of left ventricular volume overload.\\nOther class I recommendations call for aortic valve surgery in symptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation, regardless of left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and LV systolic dysfunction. Aortic valve surgery may be considered in other asymptomatic patients meeting certain criteria.\\n\"Thresholds for intervention now are lower than they were previously because of more durable treatment options and lower procedural risks,\" according to the authors.\\nAnother important addition to the guidelines is the class IIa recommendation for mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (previously dubbed \"transcatheter mitral valve repair\") to treat patients with chronic severe secondary mitral regurgitation related to LV systolic dysfunction who remain severely symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy.\\nSupporting this decision was evidence from 2019\\'s COAPT trial showing quality of life benefits of MitraClip therapy in these patients.\\nOtto and colleagues also handed a small boost to mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair for people with severely symptomatic primary mitral regurgitation who are at high or prohibitive risk for surgery.\\nThe old class IIb (weak) recommendation for this procedure was bumped up to class IIa (moderate) when mitral valve anatomy is favorable and patient life expectancy is at least 1 year.\\nThe ACC/AHA guideline was developed in collaboration with and endorsed by the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the American Society of Echocardiography, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.\\nOtto had no disclosures.\\nSource Reference: Otto CM, et al \"2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines\" Circulation 2020; DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000923.',\n",

Consider converting a portion of the lawn into a flower or vegetable garden.\\nIf you have a healthy lawn, your soil is probably in good shape. Simply edge the area you plan to convert into garden.

Top this with shredded leaves, herbicide-free grass clippings, evergreen needles or woodchips.\\nThe newspaper or cardboard layer provides an additional barrier to the weeds. And, as it breaks down and the grass beneath dies and decomposes, they add organic matter to the soil below.\\nYou can plant immediately, but you’ll need more effort to dig through the paper layer and freshly covered turf. Or wait a few months for everything to decompose for easier planting.\\nA bit more information: You can also remove the existing sod with a sod cutter or flat shovel. Use healthy sections of grass to repair damaged areas in the lawn. Or place it in the compost bin, grass side down.

Life would be so much easier if we had more money, more time, more people around us, fewer people around us, if we could go out to work, if we didn't have to work ................ Life is rarely exactly as we want it to be and a diagnosis of dementia highlights the loss of all those plans we had for the future, all those unfulfilled dreams and all those wants and wishes we now daren't put into words. HOWEVER is life ever all bad? Personally I find it easier to look for the silver linings in my life than to dwell on the things that are now missing or won't happen and my upcoming birthday is, I think, a case in point. If you've only just joined us or haven't been paying close attention you may have missed the fact that I have a big birthday arriving very soon and a few years ago when I thought about it I had lots of plans and ideas. We could go somewhere exotic on holiday; we could have a party in the garden with a band on the patio; we could hire somewhere big and fancy and invite everyone we'd ever met..... I do quite like to be the centre of attention so any of these would have been more than acceptable but then dementia struck and it seemed that my big birthday was going to be so very boring and I was full of disappointment. Gradually though I've worked my way through the fog and decided that it's up to me to decide whether life, and birthdays, are to be boring or as exciting as they would be if life was normal. With that in mind then I began to make different plans for my birthday and came up with the idea of a new car. Then I decided to arrange to pick it up on the actual day and suddenly the birthday was fun again. Since then friends, of whom there are many and every one of them wonderful, have been popping up with ideas so that now the birthday which had gone from huge and potentially glamourous to small and flat now consists of several days of fun including a long walk followed by lunch at a favourite coffee bar; sunrise at the beach followed by breakfast; a trip to Jake's and lunch out with the nearly 7 year old and associated adults; car collection with Ash, a drive round the countryside and possibly lunch out if he's up to it; tea on the field in front of the house; another lunch and on and on it seems.

Vegas’ sprawling tunnel system is home to 300 to 400 people who have built lives for themselves underground.\\nIn the 1990s, the city began construction on storm-drainage tunnels to prevent against flash floods. Two hundred miles of flood tunnels were built, and today they house much of Las Vegas’ homeless population. Many of them are veterans suffering from PTSD. Others came to Las Vegas in search of a better life and fell onto hard times. The tunnels are largely ignored by police, and a peek inside shows evidence of life at every turn. One section has been transformed into something of an art gallery with detailed graffiti filling the walls. Another space houses a couple who have fully furnished the 400 square-foot room with a wardrobe, a double bed, and a bookshelf that holds a small library of salvaged books.\\nSuch elaborate living spaces become problematic whenever the flood tunnels are used for their original purpose. Rain water can flow through the tunnels and wash away the residents' belongings, which one dweller referred to as “flushing the toilet.”\\nAfter journalist Matthew O’Brien discovered the Las Vegas tunnels when reporting a story, he founded the Shine a Light project to provide food, clothing, services, and more to the city’s underground homeless population. Together with HELP of Southern Nevada, they set up people in desperate situations with alternative housing and the attention they need.

The phone pouches were not advertised when I bought the tickets. Had I known that my phone would be locked in a pouch, I would've passed on this concert. Shame on everyone for not making the phone pouch announced ahead of time.\\nIf you are a die hard fan of jack white, show up. If you enjoy being treated with dignity and enjoy a good sounding show... Do anything else\\nMike from Tulsa, Oklahoma\\nMOST UNDERWHELMING CONCERT I'VE BEEN TO.\\nI guess I USED to love Jack White but this concert fixed that. The first half felt like a\\ngarage jam session, not a paid concert. When the musicians left the stage I've NEVER\\nseen so many people leave a performance at this point. Usually there is a demand\\nfor an encore. Not this time. I read that Jack doesn't use a set list. Maybe he should\\ntry that. First concert I've attended where the artist sounded better recorded than\\nlive. Honestly, I still don't even know who the opening act was. They never said,\\nwhich is OK because they were awful, but still....overall a waste of an evening.\\nTim Emineth from Portland, Oregon\\nWHY SO LOUD\\nBought my tickets the first day they went on sale. Got pretty good seats for 60 dollars, which I thought was a good deal. Was looking forward to the show, very excited and happy to be going. But when he came on it was so loud that even though I had planed ahead and brought ear plugs, I just couldn't handle it. I am 60 years young and will always go to see live music but at what price, do I have to go deaf. I already am heard of hearing because of past concerts when I was younger and didn't know better and stood in front of the speakers so we could get closer. sorry you drove me away Jack I was looking forward to it\\nBlastinB from Detroit, Michigan\\nTERRIBLE ALL THE WAY AROUND\\nLet me just say I'm a big fan of Jack White.\\nThat's said, that was the weakest showing of\\nhim that I've ever experienced and I've seen\\nhim five other times... from the strange\\nopening bands and techno house DJ\\nsomething played too 1/3 Full Arena left the\\nsound very echoing and cavernous.\\nEverything doused in blue and aimed at the\\naudience reminded me of those horrible\\nChristmas lights that give you a headache as\\nyou drive by...

I don't mean a bit louder than you might like, but ear-bleedingly loud. This wasn't so at all for the first two bands, so I don't understand why it Jack's set was like this. But it was like they didn't do a sound check to ensure the volume was at a tolerable level. Truly a terrible pity, because it literally ruined the show for me (and my girlfriend too). I left mystified at how such a brilliant musician and seasoned pro could have made such a fundamental mistake.\\nCc from Toronto, Ontario\\nCOME ON JACK..\\nPlease fire your sound people. Worst concert I have seen in a while and I love Jack White. It was so loud you could hardly tell what song he was playing. We left after the 3rd song.\\nJim from Seattle, Washington\\nWHAT’S WITH THE TERRIBLE DISTORTED SOUND ???\\nI went to see Jack White, and to make a long story short, unless you were sticking your fingers in your ears you couldn’t make out anything he was playing it was truly awful !

       " \"'Scandal' TV Show: How It Teaches the Benefits Of Loyalty\\nLoyalty is in short supply this day and age, as Americans are at each other’s throats as partisanship has spread from Washington into our daily lives\\nFor the past several days, I have rifled through a number of episodes of Scandal , an ABC series. It features Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope, a “fixer” of political and personal problems in the nation’s capital. Admittedly, my attraction to the show is partially because of the star character’s beauty and charisma. However, the storyline contains another important theme that most viewers should appreciate: loyalty.\\nEvery one of Pope’s employees has a very complex and dysfunctional history including insider trading, domestic violence, black ops, and murder. These people are loyal to Pope, who recruited each one of them during low points in their lives. She is the mastermind of her business, and when she speaks it is gospel.\\nPope is loyal to her subordinates to an extreme, a trait that is certainly becoming less prevalent in our society. She loves her co-workers and protects them. Her firm is a well-oiled machine where each employee does his or her job with enthusiasm and great skill. But the most important thing that binds them is loyalty.\\nScandal is sensational and unrealistic at times. But, the underlying importance of loyalty to the program is something worth dwelling upon in our lives. And so, here are eight aspects of life where loyalty is important.\\nFidelity to one’s life partner is probably the most intimate form of loyalty. It’s what solidifies a relationship between lovers. How can two people share their most private thoughts in an environment devoid of trust? When one party steps over the line, the bond is broken and is forever lost. It is the beginning of a slippery slope that is impossible to reverse. Can a person in a relationship ever forget betrayal? I don’t believe so.\\nThere are many among us who are unhappy with our government. Young people today believe they are unique in this regard. Discontent in American history is not a new phenomenon. Nevertheless, most protesters believe America continues to be the greatest place on earth. Loyalty comes into play when malcontents resort to violence to make their point. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. never encouraged physical confrontation, and he was responsible for some of the most important social changes in America. When anyone crosses the line, from peaceful to violent protest, his relationship with this country is marred forever.\\nThe bond that exists between a company and its employees is critical to the success of the enterprise. There are very few more important symbiotic relationships. In fact, every company proclaims its workers are its most important asset. Yet, the two have experienced many strained moments since the Industrial Revolution. At different times, the pendulum swings and one group dominates the other. But, when an advantage becomes abusive, unfair work rules or excessive compensation demands, loyalty and partnership are lost and both sides suffer.\\nGenerally, if every American strove to be “fair” in their dealings with others, the country would be a better place. However, cheating on taxes, cheating on medical reimbursement, stealing from others, taking advantage of customers, and so on, erodes the loyalty and trust we have for each other. The resultant society is one that is more dysfunctional each year and far less efficient. If medical fraud vanished, the savings would likely be large enough to finance universal health care.\\nAmericans must obey the law, if our society is going to persevere. Every misdemeanor and felony weakens our nation and must be dealt with aggressively by the courts. Those that abuse others, create havoc, commit crimes against humanity, etc. must be punished with little mercy. And those who threaten national security are among the worst offenders. They are in effect attacking our way of life and each American’s chances to be happy.\\n6. Ethics and morality\\nBehavior is also affected by our personal standards. Americans must be ethical and moral. We should make decisions that are righteous and fair, with empathy for others. Standing by and watching Americans starve for any reason is immoral. Not providing an education for all children in America is unconscionable.\\n7. Hard work\\nAmericans must be able to work. It is the responsibility of the federal government to create jobs if the private sector cannot. Many of the political and social problems we face as a nation have evolved from a system that does not demand that every able-bodied person work. Giving people aid who are not handicapped is a form of enslavement. It is unfair, as the recipient’s dependence grows with each dollar of aid, and it is unfair to working Americans who are taxed to finance inappropriate financial benefits.\\nEvery person has a constitutional and God-given right to be happy, so long as it is not at the expense of others. Gay marriage is a perfect example of this issue. There is no public policy benefit to prohibit two people of the same sex to formally express their love for each other.\\nOlivia Pope is loyal to her employees, and her employees are loyal to her. It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement. Americans should be loyal and expect it from others in return.\",\n",

       " 'When considering window treatments, there is a wide array of choices for homeowners, including curtains, blinds, shades, and drapes. Yet, among these options, the plantation shutter distinguishes itself with its enduring elegance and practicality. Renowned for centuries, these versatile and timeless window treatments have maintained popularity for good reasons.\\nAt Mike’s Flooring & Design Center, we collaborate with top-notch manufacturers of plantation shutters to guarantee that the windows in your Ocean Pines, MD home or business exude their utmost charm.\\nWhy Choose Plantation Shutters For Your Property in Ocean Pines, MD?\\nAesthetics and Versatility\\nPlantation shutters, with their wide louvers and clean lines, add a touch of sophistication to any room. Their classic design complements various architectural styles, from traditional to contemporary. Available in a range of materials such as wood, vinyl, and composite, these shutters can be customized to suit the unique character of your home.\\nLight Control and Privacy\\nOne of the primary advantages of plantation shutters is their exceptional light control. The adjustable louvers allow you to regulate the amount of natural light entering a room, providing a versatile solution for different times of the day. By tilting the louvers, you can enjoy soft diffused light or create a private sanctuary, shielding your interiors from prying eyes.\\nPlantation shutters are not just a decorative element; they also contribute to energy efficiency. When closed, they act as an additional layer of insulation, helping to regulate indoor temperatures. This can lead to reduced energy consumption by minimizing the need for excessive heating or cooling, ultimately saving on utility bills.\\nDurability and Low Maintenance\\nInvesting in quality plantation shutters ensures long-lasting durability. Unlike traditional blinds or curtains that may wear out over time, these shutters are built to withstand the test of time. Their sturdy construction makes them resistant to warping, fading, and cracking. Additionally, maintaining plantation shutters is a breeze; a simple wipe-down with a damp cloth is often sufficient to keep them looking pristine.\\nIncreased Property Value\\nHome improvements that enhance both functionality and aesthetics can significantly increase the value of your property. Plantation shutters, being a permanent fixture, are considered an attractive feature by potential buyers. The timeless appeal and durability of these shutters can make your home stand out in the real estate market, offering a return on investment that extends beyond personal enjoyment.\\nEvery home is unique, and plantation shutters can be tailored to suit individual preferences and requirements. From choosing the material and color to deciding on the louver size, homeowners have the freedom to customize these shutters according to their style and functional needs. This level of personalization ensures that the shutters seamlessly integrate into the overall design of the home.\\nFor individuals with allergies, plantation shutters present a practical solution. Unlike curtains and blinds that can trap dust and allergens, shutters are easy to clean, minimizing the accumulation of irritants in your living space. This can contribute to a healthier indoor environment, particularly for those who suffer from allergies or respiratory issues.\\nWhat Makes Mike’s Flooring & Design Center the Best Choice For Plantation Shutters?\\nIf you’re committed to having plantation shutters installed, come and see us at Mike’s Flooring & Design Center!\\n- We have been serving the areas of Delmarva and Sussex County, DE, and Ocean City, MD, since 1996—more than 25 years!\\n- We carefully choose the contractors we work with—all of our contracting partners are highly skilled and experienced.\\n- We care about customer service, and we will work with you to ensure that you’re 100% satisfied with the job we’ve done.\\n- We continue to offer customer support after installation, and we’re happy to help you troubleshoot any problems at any time.\\n- We are serious about community outreach and have supported numerous charities and local organizations.\\nWhich Manufacturers Provide Products For Your Plantation Shutters in Ocean Pines, MD?\\nContact Mike’s Flooring and Design Center For Plantation Shutters in Ocean Pines, MD\\nPlease feel free to contact us through our online contact form, call us at 302-537-1899 or email us at firstname.lastname@example.org, and we will be more than happy to assist you with your project.

       " \"We are in the heart of the city, more precisely at 1, Via San Spiridione, to discover a gem that opened its doors just a few weeks ago. And who could be behind this marvelous and ambitious project if not Walter Gustin himself who, with his 040 Group, counts several venues scattered around the city? From 040 Social Food to...shall I refresh your memory? The list is long! There's DRAW, LOFT, PIER, all the way up to the more recent BOA BEACH.\\nYet Walter was missing something. Yup, missing from the roll call was a little place designed for staying in town, where he could welcome guests from outside Trieste. Said and done: he transformed 320 square meters of his property into four suites and two rooms, right in the middle of Borgo Teresiano.\\nI had the chance to see them in advance for you and I was happily surprised. The finishes are truly marvelous and follow the common thread that unites all of Mr. Gustin's little places: wood, iron, plants, and the recovery of modern-day furniture revisited and repurposed by turning everything upside down. One example? An old record player can turn into a nightstand.\\nSeen that we’re talking about record players, here in every room you will find vinyls, ready to play impressive and intriguing background music. The beauty of this lies in the fact that the sound comes out of super modern speakers, resulting in a clean and crystal-clear sound.\\nThe wood of the floor blends perfectly with the warm colors of the walls, from sage green tones to blue ones, to the anthracite gray that characterizes some rooms: they mix in a successful combination with the satin-black bathroom fixtures.\\nIn room N1 you’ll find the private SPA consisting of a whirlpool shower and waterfall. Isn’t it crazy? What’s wonderful about this place is that no two rooms are the same, they all differ in some detail. Which is quite tasteful, I might add.\\nThe hanging beds give the room a clean and essential feel, yet they still give a sense of great hospitality. A kettle and a coffee capsule machine are the common element of the rooms. Some spaces are even equipped with a hot plate, which is ideal for chefs, who never go on vacation! The courtesy kits are also very well-finished, with super-soft bathrobes 🙂\\nThe finishes are refined and never mundane, as I already mentioned: designer lamps alternate with modern antique pieces, and light, white curtains complement a fitting system of interior shutters, the perfect solution for those who sleep in total darkness. As for the silence element, there’s no problem: triple-glazed window frames will not let even the slightest noise in from the busy Carducci and San Spiridione streets. Some rooms have small balconies from which to admire charming views of the city such as the Roman Theater and Piazza della Borsa.\\nA parking space for the car? Again, it’s no problem here. The nearby Park San Giusto will be the ideal solution.\\nThe rooms are mainly doubles, but some also have a double or single sofa bed.\\nI think these shots (taken on a rainy day!) speak volumes.\\nAnd now we come to the point of the article. Since this is a brand-new project, the website is not yet active. So if you want to book a room you will have to write an email to: email@example.com or resort to Booking.com by clicking here\\nHow much does it cost? Obviously, it varies depending on the season. In November (which is considered low season) the room prices range between 110 and 130 euros per night for two people, a price I think is absolutely in line for a place like this.\\nTo recap: you've asked for a few videos on my social medias, you have a small article with photos...I'd say you have no excuse but to go!\\nFoto Michele Grimaz\",\n",

       " 'Time, order, and the ethical in the production of ethnographic knowledge\\nby Nathaniel Roberts\\nSince coming to Max Planck I have begun to measure my readings in inches. Today I gathered the articles I have read over the last 4 weeks; combined with the pages of hand-written notes I have taken on both readings and seminar presentations, the stack was 4.5 inches high. Without the underlinings and marginal notes I have made, these printouts would soon be useless to me. While I have a good memory for overall arguments and conclusions, the pencil markings I have made are the threads that will lead me back to the empirical details and interesting side arguments. But what to do with the stack itself? If I just pile it atop the previous months’ reading and notes I will become once again lost. The chances of finding a dimly remembered title in which some precious argument was made grows less and less certain as the stack grows ever larger. Nor is any physical filing system adequate to the task. Thematically, any documents will seem to belong equally well in at least two different files. To organize them arbitrarily by author’s surname represents only a minor improvement over the chronological stack.\\nThe problem is one anyone who has conducted ethnographic fieldwork will instantly recognize. Collecting reams of data is the easy part, figuring out how to organize it so that the relevant bits can be retrieved at a later date—that is the problem. I once met a fellow anthropologist on the field who told me proudly that he had recorded 200 hours of interviews. On cassette tapes! None of it had been transcribed. He hadn’t even made notes during the interviews to tell him what each tape contained. Poor fellow. So far as I know his dissertation remains uncompleted.\\nBattling my own field notes—that was how I spent the two hottest hours of the day, gnawing on caffeine pills and dripping sweat onto my notebooks, as everyone else in my slum enjoyed their midday nap. I was never entirely successful. Often I felt like the aphasiacs described in Foucault’s Order of Things who, “when shown various differently coloured skeins of wool on a table top, are consistently unable to arrange them into any coherent pattern.”1 But though I never hit upon a foolproof system for ordering my data, the consistent effort to do so bore unexpected fruit. I began to amaze slum dwellers with my apparently wizard-like power to recall the details of quotidian events from many months ago. And in the favorite slum pastime of trying to decipher the hidden meanings of other people’s actions (in a milieu where everyone was sure something was being hidden from them—why did she speak that way to her sister? why is she accusing that boy of trying to seduce her daughter when he is clearly innocent?) I became an acknowledged seer, even despite my imperfect command of the language and the fact that privacy concerns meant I could not reveal all I knew. But it was easy. For I had not only heard the same stories told from dozens of different perspectives, but was able to “remember” them in all their every detail, perceive even the tiniest inconsistencies in stories that would normally go unnoticed in the flow of events, and discern unmistakable patterns in the concatenation of minor details.\\nThus I smile at the question, of perpetual interest to anthropology students and others who know fieldwork only secondhand: “As an outsider, how can you be sure you really understand the people you studied? How do you know they weren’t just saying what they thought you wanted to hear?” Of course people shape what they say to what they think you want to hear—or to what they want you to think. But what they in fact tell you is not always what they think they are telling you, and is always much more than what they say.\\nIt is often said that the special knowledge claims of the fieldworker depend on the immediacy of their physical presence in the field—of having actually “been there.” While some ethnographers may have actually implied such a thing, I do not think this is an accurate or helpful description of what we do. Ethnographic knowledge, like all knowledge, is necessarily mediated. And this is no less true for the ethnographer having “been there.” Nor does the fact that it is mediated through elaborate (and inevitably) incomplete notes and other records make it any less reliable. The ethnographer’s knowledge is always partial, of course, but that is true of all knowledge. And it is also therefore true of the knowledge “natives” have of one another. To ask how an “outsider” can really understand natives is to picture culture as a bounded, internally transparent whole. Before asking how the outsider could understand natives, one should ask how natives understand each other. What we call “culture” does not involve a mystical mind-meld joining insiders but excluding others. It is itself mediated through language and through other publicly observable signs and actions. “Insider” and “outsider” are not neutral categories that simply describe positions relative to some already existing totality. They are themselves signs whose meanings are variably applied within different language games (including that of the anthropologist), and their social salience is not always what North American identity politics would predict.\\nThe defining feature of anthropological knowledge is thus neither the spurious immediacy of ethnographic authority, nor the fact that it is in reality highly mediated, but the sorts of questions and concerns it addresses. That and the manner in which it is produced. As my previous comments on sweat and caffeine pills suggest, there is no golden road to science. At the same time, to be freed from the practical struggles of daily life in order to spend all one’s waking moments simply collecting and processing information is itself an immense privilege—as Pierre Bourdieu has reminded us—and one that is possibly only with serious economic backing. Thus although I lost some 20 pounds while living in the slum, this was due entirely to the rigors of fieldwork and not (unlike many of those around me) for lack of sufficient food to eat. And it is by recognizing this difference, I think, that the ethical relationship of the social scientist to those she studies, and to the world around her, is most usefully approached.\\nIn the case of my own research, what this meant was attempting to build a picture, not only of these Dalit slum dwellers’ “culture,” but how that culture is produced, what it hides from view, where its fault lines lie, who it helps and who it hurts, and, perhaps most importantly, what can be said about the relations between the slum and the dominant society around it that serve to render slum dwellers so abject. To get a handle on these sorts of questions was not so easy as the parlor magic I described above—mindreading and such. It required me to work long hours, seven days a week for over a year after returning from the field: sifting through and coding data, searching out patterns, trying out one interpretation after another (only to have each bump up against some inconvenient datum, forcing me to abandon it), until finally I hit upon an explanation that really made sense to me. Writing an ethnography need not be so arduous; I recall the late Olivia Harris once advising fieldwork returnees to “write everything up as fast as possible, because it is only when you first return that you understand it all.” It all depends what you are looking for, I suppose… and not all of us possess Olivia’s intuitive ability to synthesize disparate ethnographic data. But even in the case of the fieldworker who “sees it all in an instant,” as it were, this intuitive leap should not be mistaken for immediacy. The road to instantaneous insight is always paved by many months and even years of very hard work.\\n* * *\\nOh, about the problem of ordering my stack of readings and handwritten notes, with which this essay began. Although the problem here is not fundamentally different from that of ordering fieldnotes, the stakes are somewhat lower; whereas all one’s field data must be accounted for, if I forget an argument in some paper I have read, this will not prevent me from forging ahead with my own arguments in quite the same way. Whenever my stack of reading and notes grows too big, I simply scan the whole batch, and store the resulting PDF files on my computer. Unlike paper files, these can be multiply indexed using keywords within a free bibliographic program like Zotero. I then take the whole stack, and toss it in the recycling bin!\\nNathaniel Roberts, January 2012\\n1 Such aphasiacs, Foucault continues, “will create a multiplicity of tiny, fragmented regions in which nameless resemblances agglutinate things into unconnected islets; in one corner, they will place the lightest-coloured skeins, in another the red ones, somewhere else those that are softest in texture, in yet another place the longest, or those that have a tinge of purple or those that have been wound up into a ball. But no sooner have they been adumbrated than all these groupings dissolve again… and so the sick mind continues to infinity, creating groups then dispersing them again.”',\n",

       " 'Merike Estna has discussed and tested the limits of painting as both idea and action over a long period of time. With her expressive style, the Estonian artist unites an abstract visual language that seems to be taken from our digital age with motifs from myths and folk tales. In her work, an inviting openness converges with an understated sense of humour, examining the tradition-laden structures that have come to be associated with the medium of painting in particular.\\nThe painterly medium is allowed to expand beyond frame and canvas, taking over both the exhibition space and the human body. The works occasionally function as props or objects and take the shape of benches, tables, floor or wearable items of clothing. Through social and performative elements, the viewer is coaxed into mutual, at times subtle participation.\\nMerike Estna also introduces handicraft techniques, such as ceramics, into her installations. Through her choice of motifs, creative processes, materials and poetic titles, the viewer’s understanding and interpretation is led in several different directions including philosophical, political and personal dimensions.\\nIn Merike Estna’s work, painting becomes a living, fluid substance with unforeseen possibilities, and where the spiritual meets the material. Her work seems to be as much about the specific medium itself as the attitude and freedom that permeates both the process and the social structures that come out of it.\\nMerike Estna (b. 1980) lives in Tallinn where she is associate professor at the Estonian Academy of Arts. The exhibition at Moderna Museet Malmö is the artist’s first solo exhibition in Scandinavia.

       " \"If you are like me, sometimes it feels like our hair is going nowhere: no change, no improvement, no growth. However, watching old pictures of our hair often makes us gasp! Sometimes, it's a happy discovery: when your current hair is longer, stronger, has more density than in the picture. But other times..., it is rather quite a shameful and discouraging experience to see your hair has deteriorated...\\nBut how can you ensure your hair keeps growing? It’s simple. Do those 3 things and you will see results. It's guaranteed.\\nKEEP THE MOISTURE IN\\nThe main challenge with our curly hair is that it looses its moisture very quickly. I mean, very quickly. Everything we do seems to remove moisture from our hair: touching it, friction (hello pillows and scarfs!), synthetic material (collective side-eye to hair extensions…). However, luckily for us we have products and techniques that help boost moisture in our hair and keep it in.\\n- Hair butters will help seal-in the moisture in your hair. Put some just before you jump in the pool or swim at the beach to protect your hair from the dryness caused by the chlorine or the salty water. Also, this is a must if you wear hair extensions: apply some just before you braid your hair. It will keep your hair moisturized and protected during even when you wear extensions for extended periods of time.\\n- Try to reduce friction every time you can: satin bonnets, satin pillow cases, lining your winter hats with satin are your go tos\\n- Reduce manipulation with protective hair styles : braids, wigs, plaits, twists. Anything that will keep your hands out of your hair!\\nSTRENGTHEN YOUR HAIR\\nMoisture gets all the spotlight, rightfully so. However, if your curls get spongy, is over-elastic, look limp, lack definition, then it is because your hair needs protein.\\n- Protein deep treatments will help reconnect the protein chains inside the hair, giving the structure back to each hair strand.\\n- To prevent weakening your hair; reduce the usage of heat because it breaks the structure that gives the curl pattern to your hair. This is why heat damaged hair will look straight and limp even when wet... It's summer girl... so take a break with that air dryer!\\nLet’s make one thing clear: your curly hair grows. Yes it does. All hair grows between 0.5- 1 inch per month. The reason why you do not see the length is simply because when it grows, it creates a new curls instead of appearing longer. But the good thing is that if you stretch it, you will see the length! So the lesson is to leave your hair alone. Stretch your hair (only a few times thought) just to see how much it has grown. But it is all about being patient and letting your hair live, be and create that next curl.\\nNext time you wonder if your hair is growing, just remember that it is growing beautiful, strong, healthy, glorious curls!\",\n",

       " 'Most of the news this year has been dominated by stories about Covid-19. Because of this, some other important news either doesn’t get reported or doesn’t get much notice. One such news item appeared in late March, and it is a report that Arkansas parents need to be aware of.\\nA car insurance comparison site conducted an analysis of publicly available data on teen alcohol use and driving behaviors. It then ranked 15 states based on these criteria. According to the report, Arkansas had the highest rate of teen drinking and driving among the 15 states studied.\\nThe data analyzed was from 2017, which is the most recent data available. The report found that just over 25 percent of Arkansas teens anonymously surveyed admitted to drinking alcohol within the past 30 days. More worrisome was the fact that 10.7 percent of teen respondents in Arkansas admitted to having driven a car after drinking (within the previous 30 days). This is more than three times the number of adults who drove after having too much to drink (3.1 percent).\\nTo be sure, it is very possible that most teens who drove after drinking were not legally drunk by adult standards (having a blood-alcohol concentration at or above 0.08 percent). However, as novice drivers, teens are already at higher risk of crashes. Driving with even small amounts of alcohol in their systems would greatly increase the risk of an injurious or fatal crash.\\nAnd from a legal perspective, teens who drink and drive have a much lower threshold for legal consequences. Under Arkansas’s zero-tolerance law, any driver under the age of 21 can be charged with DWI if their BAC is at or above 0.02 percent. In some cases, that can equate to consuming a single alcoholic drink.\\nIf you are the parent of a teen driver, please have a serious talk with them about the dangers – physical and legal – of drinking and driving. And if your son or daughter has been charged with underage drinking and driving, contact an experienced criminal defense attorney as soon as reasonably possible.',\n",
       " 'Heading to the market in Orvieto? First, you have to get there\\nIn some respects, reaching Orvieto (located in the southern part of the region of Umbria, Italy) is much like visiting an island because it takes some effort to get there. The medieval walled city sits on a high plateau of volcanic ash stone (Tufa) about 1000 feet above the valley.\\nAlthough you can drive up hairpin-curved roads leading to the town, the chances of finding a parking spot are iffy and all the discoveries seem to be in pedestrian-only squares and alleys. As a result, many tourists leave their cars in the public lot below and ascend a series of underground ramps, steps and escalators by foot (taking approximately 10 minutes) to reach the top.\\nIn addition to being able to see all the town’s architectural, art and crafts treasures, one of the rewards of emerging from underground on a Thursday or Saturday morning is being able to visit the bustling outdoor market held in the Piazza del Popolo.\\nSet on cobblestone streets, the square is anchored by the Palazzo de Popolo (The People’s Palace), a Romanesque-Gothic palace that now serves as a conference center.\\nWhat you’ll find at the market in Orvieto?\\nOn market days, the square and surrounding streets are filled with haphazardly arranged trucks and stands as shoppers weave their way around them. Many cooking classes for tourists also begin here with students shopping with their chefs.\\nThe mix of finds at the market in Orvieto\\nThis centuries-old market offers a mix of food, vestiti (clothes) and home goods.\\nThe region of Umbria has been dubbed the “green heart” of Italy because it is so rich in wine and agriculture; farmers and artisanal producers from the surrounding countryside arrive at the market in Orvieto early in the morning to sell their products. They close up just in time for the lunch hour.\\nLike many in Italy, the market in Orvieto is far less manicured (and costly) than those in France.\\nUmbrian cooking is characterized as being simple in recipes and technique but made with outstanding ingredients. Walking through the market with all the local, seasonal food products, we only regretted that our hotel room didn’t have a kitchen.\\nThe main event\\nIf we had to name the one standout of this colorful market, it would have to be the truck just inside one of the alleys leading to the square that sells porchetta. Often sold in roadside stands throughout Italy, porchetta is a boneless, moist pork roast stuffed with herbs and traditionally cooked over wood.\\nThe meat is usually eaten as part of a warm sandwich (panino) with a crisp piece of fatty skin adding to the savory taste. Every time we see one of the white porchetta trucks on the road, my husband lusts over this dish that is so popular with working men across the country. Because it was too early for lunch, we ordered two panini wrapped to take home to our hotel.\\n- It’s always better to arrive early in the morning when the crowds are less dense.\\n- Be sure to have your Italian dictionary and some knowledge of metric measurements if you are planning to purchase fruits, vegetables or nuts.\\n- Cash only, of course.\\nIF YOU GO\\nPiazza del Popolo Market in Orvieto\\nOpen Thursday and Saturday mornings from 7AM-12PM\\nPreviously on MoreTimeToTravel.com\\n- Public markets offer a taste of a city and its culture\\n- Tips for visiting public markets\\n- Great markets travel bloggers love to visit\\n- Market visit – Coquimbo Fish Market in Chile\\n- Market visit – Mercado 23 in Cancun, Mexico\\n- Market visit – Carnot Market in Lyon, France\\n- Market visit – President Wilson Market in Paris\\n- Market visit – Saint Antoine Market in Lyon, France\\n- Local markets make for perfect Saturday morning getaways\\n- Only on Sundays – Marche des Quai',\n",
       " 'For those of you who know me, you know I’m an audio nut, I guess that’s what happens after spending almost a decade at Sonos. Yes, I have more speakers in my house than rooms and more headphones than devices to plug them into. Along with loving music and listening to it just about every minute of the day (yes we have Sonos all over our office too!) I also love good sound for movie and tv shows.\\nBut I have something to admit that seems to baffle most of my friends, it doesn’t bug me that Apple removed the headphone jack from their new iPhone. I pre-ordered the iPhone, can’t wait to get it, and don’t think my life is going to be a complicated mess in any way in the absence of a 3.5 mm headphone jack.\\nAcross the Interwebs the removal of the headphone jack definitely struck a nerve, here are some examples:\\nEither way, the burden was decidedly on Apple to convince users that they wouldn’t miss the headphone jack. And now that we’re a few days removed from the event, we can calmly ask: did Apple adequately justify its decision to remove the headphone jack?\\nUnfortunately, the answer to that question is resounding no.\\n(Source – BGR)\\nWhile it’s tough to make the case that dropping the headphone jack is better for consumers, the benefits for Apple are much easier to see. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones. Apple profits from both. (Source – The Verge)\\nApple’s iPhone 7 has no headphone jack.\\nInstead, Apple wants people to use its proprietary Lightning connector to attach headphones — or, better yet, to buy Apple’s new $160 wireless AirPods.\\nIf that sounds like a major frustration to you, don’t worry — there’s a very silly-looking dongle that you can plug into your phone so that standard headphones will work. (Source – Business Insider)\\nSo why I am not grabbing my pitchfork and heading for Cupertino? To be honest with you there are three simple reasons why this doesn’t but me at all, and sorry in advance if my reasoning bugs you but here they are:\\n- I actually think it will drive innovation and move consumers towards wireless headphones faster. While the act of a removing the headphone jack from a device isn’t innovative, the fact that it got so many people talking about it and thinking about wireless headphones I do think will move consumers away from wired and into wireless faster. Wired headphones have been around for 100+ years, wireless is quickly becoming the norm and the more we can thrust it into the focal point of conversation the faster that transition will take place. Yes, Apple as the owner of Beats headphones and a newly minted “expensive” set of earbuds will benefit in the process but let’s be realistic, there are a zillion other companies that make wireless headphones and the iPhone 7 works with all of them.\\n- I do think that Apple will benefit from having more space for hardware inside the iPhone 7 chassis. As someone that spent a great deal of time with microelectronics (I’m an Electrical and Computer Engineering Major) I know that every millimeter of space counts. Simply put, the headphone jack took up space, and without it there’s more space for other more innovative/useful things inside the chassis.\\n- The audio quality through the lightning port is higher quality. Like I said, I’m an audio nut, and I like great sound quality, so connecting my wired headphones to a port that provides for higher sound quality is a-okay by me.\\nAlso, just one last point and then I’m done here…Apple does include a free dongle that you can use to still plug wired headphones into the iPhone 7 so it won’t cost anyone a penny more to listen to their current wired headphones.\\nSo that’s my two cents, what do you think? Comment and let your voice be heard!(Image source – 9to5mac)',\n",
       " 'ALBANY — The Grow NY Farms Coalition has announced that the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) is in support of maintaining the current overtime threshold at 60 hours for family farms across the Empire State.\\nDuring their 2022 Legislative Conference in Albany, which took place March 14-16, NYSAC passed a resolution affirming the group’s support of the current 60-hour overtime threshold.\\nNYS Association of Counties President and Tioga County Chair Martha Sauerbrey said, “New York’s counties are proud to stand with the family farmers and farmworkers who produce the food that fills our grocery store shelves, our school cafeterias and local foodbanks in opposing this change to the overtime threshold. We need to be doing everything we can to support our local farmers as they confront challenges from increasingly erratic weather and rising costs of feed and fuel, not adding additional burdens that threaten their ability to feed our communities and power local economies.”\\nNYS County Executives Association President and Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro said, “New York’s counties have sent a clear message that we cannot let our farmers and farmworkers lose income, hours, or the ability to continue providing local milk and food to our communities. These multi-generational family-run businesses are essential, and can’t stand by and allow them to go out of business, while their employees leave to work more hours in competing states. Nourish NY, food pantries, local grocery stores, school districts – all of our programs and food hubs depend on our local supply chain. Any reduction in the overtime threshold will only put family farms and New York’s food security at risk.”\\nNY Farm Bureau Vice President, and Partner at A. Ooms & Sons Dairy Farm in Columbia County, Eric Ooms said, “New York State’s county leaders have made their voices heard, and we hope that Governor Kathy Hochul is listening. We’re grateful for NYSAC’s support and partnership as we continue to advocate for the viability of New York’s farms and protection of the state’s local food supply. We cannot ignore the more than 70% of participants who asked to maintain the threshold during Farm Laborers Wage Board hearings. University researchers, industry experts, local and state officials, in addition to farmers and farmworkers, have asked to keep the threshold at 60. If we want to protect these family businesses for the next generation of farmers and farmworkers, the threshold must remain at 60 hours.”\\nNortheast Dairy Producers Association Chair, and Partner at Ideal Dairy Farms in Washington County, John Dickinson said, “Now is not the time to increase costs for an industry that cannot pass these increases on to consumers. Family farms are having to decide between filling the tractor’s diesel tank at more than $5 a gallon to start planting in the fields, or purchasing feed for their herd which has also skyrocketed over the past year. Any reduction in the overtime threshold is a lose-lose – for our employees, the Nourish NY program, the diversity of the state’s agriculture industry, and the viability of the future of farming in the Empire State. We’re asking Governor Hochul to stay at 60.”\\nNew York State Vegetable Growers Association President, and Partner at Reeves Farm in Onondaga County, Brian Reeves said, “Our employees want to work. They understand the need to plant and harvest when Mother Nature allows, and they have a passion for caring for the land, each other, and the fresh produce that results from all our preparation, efforts, and teamwork. Unfortunately, farms are already feeling the unintended consequences of the 60-hour threshold, as employees choose to work for our competitors in order to get the hours they’re looking for. At the same time, our margins are increasingly razor-thin and we’re unable to donate as much food as we used to. If we have any chance at retaining our skilled workforce and continuing to provide to our neighbors and families across the state, Governor Hochul must keep the overtime threshold at 60.”\\nClick here to view the resolution online, found on page 14.\\nThe Resolution Supporting Maintaining the 60-Hour Work Week for Farm Workers:\\nWHEREAS, agriculture is New York State’s largest industry; and\\nWHEREAS, the Farm Laborers Wage Board has proposed to lower the farm labor overtime threshold from 60 to 40 hours; and\\nWHEREAS, farmers are critical components of our regional economy and are necessary to ensure supermarkets are stocked with food; and\\nWHEREAS, New York State is frequently number two in the nation for agricultural products in pounds donated to foodbanks, including the Nourish New York program; and\\nWHEREAS, donations of New York-grown products would be negatively impacted as a result of lowering the overtime threshold for farm workers; and\\nWHEREAS, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, farmers have stepped up and ensured their operations continued and were responsible for donating thousands of pounds of food to local food banks at a time of significant need; and\\nWHEREAS, New York farmers face a tremendous number of challenges outside of their control, including changes in consumer demand leading to price changes, obtaining labor, climate change, land management policies, foreign market competition, and livestock and crop disease; and\\nWHEREAS, in addition to the practical issues related to growing and selling food products, New York farmers must contend with government regulations, including changes in wages and overtime threshold; and\\nWHEREAS, New York grown agricultural products would be at a competitive disadvantage in neighboring states as a result of increased labor costs associated with lowering the overtime threshold for farm workers; and\\nWHEREAS, since the adoption of the 2019 Farm Laborers Fair Practice Act, one of the more pressing issues for the farming community has been mandated overtime requirements which currently grant farmworkers a right to overtime after sixty (60) hours of work each week; and\\nWHEREAS, New York farmers are reliant on migratory work forces during New York’s short growing season, as workers are here for only a few months in the spring and summer and have limited hours each year to get the work done; and\\nWHEREAS, the Act does not prohibit the wage board from arbitrarily decreasing the overtime threshold again, further increasing costs on local farms and their use of seasonal workers; and\\nWHEREAS, the provisions of the Act would negatively impact the farming community by either increasing costs for farmers, who are operating under very tight margins, or will cut into work opportunities for migratory workers and the intended beneficiaries of overtime wages; and\\nWHEREAS, cutting budgeted support levels and drastically increasing costs through government interference should be avoided whenever possible; and\\nWHEREAS, together farmworkers and farmers oppose the overtime threshold limit, with 70 percent of all testimony opposing any change and most of the testimony provided in the hearing process requesting “NO CHANGE” to the overtime threshold.\\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the New York State Association of Counties (NYSAC) hereby supports the farmers and migrant workers who do not want their hours reduced; and\\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that NYSAC hereby supports maintaining the 60-hour work week for farmers and recommends stopping the implementation of a reduction in the farm labor overtime threshold; and\\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of this resolution be sent to the counties of New York State encouraging member counties to enact similar resolutions; and\\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that NYSAC shall forward copies of this resolution to Governor Kathy Hochul, the New York State Legislature, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, and all others deemed necessary and proper.\\nVisit GrowNYFarms.com to learn why family farms and farmworkers are asking Governor Kathy Hochul to #StayAt60.

       " 'Discover the digital Leitmerkmalmethode, which is based on developments by the BAuA and various scientific partners. Learn more about the differences, origins and advantages of this method compared to traditional approaches.\\nThe digital Key Indicator Method determines the instantaneous physical stress during manual work. At present, the (digital)Key Indicator Method can be divided into six variants: 1. manual lifting, holding, and carrying of loads (LMM-HHT), 2. manual pulling and pushing of loads (LMM-ZS), 3. manual work processes (LMM-MA), 4. the exercise of whole-body forces (LMM-GK), 5. body movement (LMM-KB) and 6. forced postures (LMM-KH). The digitaö Key Indicator Method is available in German and English respectively. These methods can now be performed and used in a digital manner (digital master feature method). In addition to the digital Key Indicator Method, physical loads on the body can also be determined with the help of EAWS. EAWS can also be performed in digital form. In the following, the origins, procedures, and reasons for the digital reference trait method and EAWS will be explained in more detail.\\nThe guidelines for the digital Key Indicator Method are based on the Council Convention of 1990. The decision includes the minimum requirements for the protection of employees during manual handling of loads, in particular through the manual load back injuries can not be excluded.\\nThe digital Key Indicator Method method is based on joint developments by the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) and various scientific partners in coordination with the State Committee for Occupational Safety and Health and Safety Technology (LASI).\\nThe (digital) Key Indicator Method LMM-HHT was first published in 2001, and the (digital) guidance feature method LMM-ZS and the LMM-MA appeared over the next 11 years. In October 2019, the BAuA last published the three extended leading characteristic methods \"LMM-HHT\", \"LMM-ZS\" and \"LMM-MA\" and additionally the three new leading characteristic methods \"LMM-GK\", \"LMM-KB\" and \"LMM-KH\".\\nThe digital Key Indicator Method was developed to meet the requirements of the load handling regulation and to be able to organize the activities of the employees in a way that is suitable for humans.\\nThe digital Key Indicator Method enables an evaluation of the risk in the case of physical stress while manual movements such as lifting or carrying loads, pulling and pushing loads or similar are carried out in the work process.\\nFinally, the evaluation of the individual sub-activities is carried out from the assessment of the determined key characteristics on the basis of a characteristic value and the determination of the weightings of the key characteristics, after the final multiplication with the time weighting.\\nHidden optimization potentials are uncovered within the scope of Motion-Mining® ergonomics analyses. The solution approach allows an evaluation of manual work, specifically the posture, and movement of employees, using wearables and a deep learning algorithm, better known as artificial intelligence. Work processes are automatically and anonymously recorded, processed by artificial intelligence, and converted into key performance indicators. Currently, we distinguish between more than 60 different movement sequences in our ergonomics analyses. Critical movements such as bending from the back, carrying, lifting, holding, overhead activities are considered in the ergonomics analysis. These movements are recorded in movement intervals, during the ergonomics analysis. In addition to the typical movements, vibrations and repetitions in particular can also be detected. Based on the data from the ergonomics analysis, overloads and permanent stresses can be identified and measures to avoid them can be derived. Methods such as EAWS are used as part of these analyses.\\nOn average, the physical resilience of men is about 2/3 that of women. This difference between women and men is primarily due to a wide variety of factors, including different body proportions. In order that, for example, these factors can also be included in physically demanding activities for preventive health reasons, the weighting of loads in the manual lifting, holding and carrying of loads (LMM-HHT) Key Indicator Method is surveyed separately for men and women according to the corresponding LMM table; with the same load weighting, women receive a higher rating. On the other hand, different multipliers apply to the various leading characteristic methods to compensate for the given differences, e.g. LMM-ZS: the intermediate score for men, is multiplied by a factor of 1.3 for women.\\nThe digital Key Indicator Method for the ergonomic assessment and evaluation of workplaces and processes makes it possible to provide a precise, generally understandable explanation of the strain on employees at specific workplaces with comparatively little effort. The digital Key Indicator Method offers improvement approaches that can be derived directly from the collected data in order to integrate them into one\\'s own work planning at an early stage.\\nThese methods, although initially conceived as analog versions, can now also be carried out and used in digital form (digital Key Indicator Method). Implemented with the latest software development tools, EAWS-digital, for example, can record and evaluate all the information required for the process in a simple and intuitive way.\\nHuman simulation (digital human models) is also used in planning for the digital factory to clarify and scrutinize manual activities in 3D as early as the planning phase. In planning, simulation is used to assess manual tasks both in terms of time economy (MTM process modules) and ergonomics (EAWS process). Human simulation for the investigation and optimization of assembly processes, time expenditure, and ergonomics is thus increasingly finding its way into everyday operations.\\nFor example, increasing economic competition worldwide and declining population growth in Europe is forcing the economic design of workplaces and process flows to include human performance. A corresponding ergonomic instrument is EAWS (Ergonomic Assessment Worksheet), which includes all stages of the life cycle of goods (developed by MTM and IAD). In cooperation with well-known European companies as users of EAWS, a continuous improvement of the ergonomic assessment takes place. EAWS can be used to optimize the ergonomics assessment with regard to posture, handling forces, manual load handling, load frequencies for the upper limb areas, e.g. in the form of the EAWS quick analysis or the automatic determination of movement data and forces (motion capturing).

       " 'What to Clean When Moving In and Out\\nWhen you’re preparing to move out of your home into a new place, there are a lot of things you have to do. You have to pack all your belongings, find the right Boston moving services, make sure everyone knows your new address, and so much more. It’s easy for things to fall through the cracks. Something that people often forget about is cleaning. If you rent, you will have to clean the house or apartment to get your deposit back. But even if you sold your home, you should clean the house as a courtesy to the new owners. Before you move into your new home, you’ll want to clean the place before you move in.\\nHere’s a basic list of everything you should clean after you move out and before you move in.\\nThe Old House\\nBefore you leave your old home for the last time, you’ll want to do a thorough check of the house or apartment to make sure you haven’t left anything behind. Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to move to get cleaning.\\n- Walls: Remove any nails or screws from the walls and spackle over the holes. In most circumstances, it’s not necessary to repaint. The landlord or new owners will take care of that.\\n- Floors: Sweep, mop, and vacuum all your floors. This isn’t just a courtesy to the new owners, it’s also a good opportunity to double-check that you haven’t left anything behind.\\n- Surfaces: Dust and wipe down all surfaces, including window sills, doorknobs, and baseboards. You should also clean all the outlets and light switches. You’d be surprised at how grimy those can be, especially outlets that were behind furniture and weren’t regularly cleaned.\\n- Windows: You may have already cleaned the windows when you were preparing to show your home to potential buyers. However, it’s a good idea to give them another once-over.\\n- Bathrooms and kitchen: These will be the center of your cleaning focus. You should allow enough time to thoroughly clean your bathrooms and kitchen. Pay special attention to your kitchen appliances, particularly the stove and refrigerator.\\nThe New House\\nHopefully, the previous owners of your new home were as considerate as you when they moved out. But no matter how well they cleaned, you’ll want to give certain areas a quick clean before your family is ready to move in.\\n- Kitchen and bathrooms: Moving in can shake up a lot of dirt. So you’ll want to make sure your kitchen and bathrooms are clean before you’re ready to use them.\\n- Garage: If the house has a garage or shed, you’ll want to sweep it out before you fill it with your stuff. You’ll never get a better opportunity!\\n- Floors: Finally, sweep, mop, and vacuum your floors before you set up your furniture. There are corners that you may never get to reach again.',\n",

You could listen to your iPod (probably the same playlist over and over again). You could pay attention to the road (if you drive, definitely choose this option). Or you could actually further your film career by listening to a movie-centric podcast.\\nWhether you’re into screenwriting, cinematography or special effects (or all three), there’s a podcast suited to your interests. So look upon this list of 10 great podcasts—all of which are available on iTunes—as a starting place. After all, it’s better than sleeping on the subway. People could steal your shoes.\\nwww.slashfilm.com/filmcast • /Filmcast snags some pretty big-name directors as guests, including recent episodes with Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) and James Cameron (do we really need to list his filmography?). In addition to /Filmcast is /Filmcast: After Dark, where the hosts discuss totally unique film-related issues, such as whether DVD special features can be too good and the ethics of theater seat-saving.\\nwww.battleshippretension.com • In addition to having arguably the best name of any film podcast out there, Battleship Pretension hosts Tyler Smith and David Bax really know their movies. In a far-reaching discussion of Shakespeare film adaptations they easily move from voicing controversial opinions on Laurence Olivier to the Macbeth adaptation Scotland, Pa., in which the characters fight over a fast food restaurant. The tone of the podcast makes it a really fun listen, too; put perfectly by the podcast’s press kit, BP “approximates the type of laid-back, free-flowing conversation had by lovers of film around the world.”\\nwww.creativescreenwriting.com/podcasts/main.html • This companion podcast to Creative Screenwriting sees senior editor Jeff Goldsmith interviewing such scribes as Oscar-winner Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker) and Michael Haneke (The White Ribbon). Gain insight into how some of the most successful screenwriters of today tackle their assignments—whether it’s adapting an existing work (as in the case of Joe Penhall and John Hillcoat, the respective writer and director of The Road) or coming up with new material.\\nwww.directorsnotes.com • With the tagline “The What, How & Why of Independent Filmmaking,” Directors Notes doesn’t focus on huge Hollywood blockbusters. Nope, there’s no talk of the latest Michael Bay actionfest here. Instead, independent moviemakers are interviewed about their craft and how they saw their ideas through from conception to production. What makes this podcast unique is that while one episode may feature an interview with a moviemaker, another could feature clips from the film being discussed, so the audience won’t be in the dark if they haven’t seen the film in question.\\nwww.film-method.com • Film Method’s first season was devoted to all things development, from networking to financing to cultivating the director-producer relationship. Now it’s well into season two: Pre-production. Featuring interviews with production designers, script supervisors, assistant directors and cinematographers about what their jobs entail and how pre-production should go, Film Method is a valuable resource for moviemakers who want to jump into the moviemaking business with some idea of how to actually, you know, make a movie.\\nwww.revision3.com/filmriot • Okay, so I’m kind of cheating on this one: Film Riot is as much a sketch comedy show as it is a lesson in moviemaking—an unlikely combination, true, but one that totally works. As funny as the podcast is, it actually does have useful information for aspiring auteurs, including tips on how to make a believable alien hand and how to make it look like it’s snowing. Another episode offers reviews on cameras that cost under $1,000. Each podcast is relatively short (even with the commercials), making it ideal for a quick lunch break fix.\\nwww.filmspotting.net • Each edition of Filmspotting is full of film reviews that really make you think. It doesn’t hurt that hosts Adam Kempenaar and Matty Robinson make the podcast fun to listen to—after all, what’s the point of listening to a podcast if it makes your mind go numb? Top five lists cooked up by the hosts include “Worst Date Movies” (Adam: The White Ribbon; Matty: Antichrist) and “Most Overrated Movie of 2009” (Both: Avatar).\\nwww.ifc.com/news/podcast • Hosts Alison Willmore and Matt Singer know a little something about film. They compile lists of films that fall into certain, uber-specific categories. For example, one episode sees Willmore and Singer discussing “Evil Twins, Doubles and Doppelgangers” (the title of the episode), including examples from films as diverse as Mulholland Dr., Psycho II and Spider-Man 3. Other episodes cover subjects like stop motion animation and guilty pleasure movies from the past decade (just to relieve the suspense, yes, American Dreamz does make the cut).\\nOn the Page\\nwww.onthepage.tv • As the host of On the Page, screenwriting consultant Pilar Alessandra brings in a variety of writers and screenwriting instructors to give useful tips on how to get your ideas… wait for it… on the page.

The mediation is a voluntary collaborative process where the parties in a conflict meet together with the help of an independent mediator in order to discuss the issues, develop options, consider alternatives, and negotiate a consensual agreement or settlement.\\nIn parallel, the local communities receive legal advice and training from Legal Aid Cambodia to ensure that discussions with the company can take place on an equal footing.\\nThe conflict between SOCFIN-KCD and the local communities from Busra is the result of the allocation of two Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) by the government to SOCFIN-KCD since 2007-08 without acknowledging the rights of the local indigenous communities who were affected in multiple ways by the investment. After years of various attempts to compensate the local villagers and solve their grievances, the company and five communities have agreed to use the mediation to try to sole the remaining issues in a systematic manner. One of the expectations of these communities is that with the conflict resolved, they will be able to apply for the registration of their land under a community land title, and thus secure their land tenure.\\nMid 2020 will mark one important step in the mediation with the signing ceremony of an agreement between SOCFIN-KCD and the communities that will settle all claims regarding the recognition of the community rights over remaining communal lands and set the final compensations related to communal lands that have been lost through the development of the plantation. The mediation is continuing in order to find a possible agreement to settle other remaining grievances and issues related to individual lands.',\n",
       " 'Common Plumbing Problems Caused By Clogged Gutters\\nGutters are an integral part of any home, and without them, there are some plumbing problems you could stumble into. It’s not just good enough to have gutters though, you need to keep them clean, too. As an experienced Maryland plumber, we wanted to take some time today to discuss some of the most common plumbing problems caused by clogged gutters.\\nWhen your gutters are clogged it means the water has nowhere to go. A gallon of water weighs roughly 8 pounds, and all of the extra weight of the water can destroy a gutter. It’s much easier to clear the clog than to repair an entire gutter system, but if your gutters are already damaged, then you’ll need some help from an Eldersburg, Maryland plumber.\\nProblems With Your Foundation\\nWhen your gutters aren’t properly draining, your home’s foundation is at risk. Water will pool in your gutters and overflow, running down the walls of your home and into your foundation. All of this excess water can cause erosion, which weakens the walls of your home and can crack the foundation.\\nThis isn’t as big of a problem during the colder months of the year, but water pooled in your gutters can lead to some troublesome mosquitoes during the summer. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant pools of water, and will gladly make your gutters their home or breeding ground. Nobody wants to have to deal with mosquitoes and their bites, so keeping the gutters clear is vital.\\nJust like with the foundation, water can also overflow down the walls of your house and seep into your basement. Once your basement is damp and has that mildew smell, it can be extremely difficult to get rid of it, as well as unsafe for the health of you and your family. That’s why your best is cleaning your gutters and preventing this from happening in the first place.\\nWork With a Professional Westminster, MD Plumber\\nHere at Michael Runk Plumbing and Heating, we’ve been providing our plumbing services to Westminster, Eldersburg, Sykesville, and many other areas of Maryland for years. If you’re having trouble with your gutters, or have any plumbing questions at all, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Our team of Maryland plumbing professionals is standing by ready to help you in any way possible. Give us a call today!',\n",

Chris Christie may be prepping for a national presidential run, but back in his home state, things do not look good.\\nAccording to a new poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind, just 30% of New Jersey voters approve of the job Christie’s doing , with the majority -- 55% -- disapproving.\\nThe Republican’s approval rating dropped six points from April, when a similar FDU PublicMindPoll showed Christie with a 36% approval rating with 50% disapproving.\\nThe lackluster numbers come as Christie has been traveling throughout the country to early voting states like New Hampshire and Iowa as he considers running for the GOP presidential nomination. He is expected to make his official intentions known within the next few weeks.\\n“The good news is that none of his potential presidential opponents have emerged with a decisive lead yet. The bad news is that he is the governor in a state where a sizable majority give a thumbs down to his leadership,” said Krista Jenkins, professor of political science and director of PublicMind.\\nWhile testing the presidential waters out of state, Christie frequently points to his gubernatorial wins, touting his ability to win over Republicans and Democrats alike. But, according to the survey, 42% said their opinion of the governor has changed for the worse since taking office, with just 13% saying they’ve grown to like him more over the years. Meanwhile, 41% said their opinion of him has not changed.\\nWhen it comes the emerging GOP presidential field, Christie is in a tie for eighth place with Sen.

Its B2B use cases, which initially were for bank and credit card identification processes, have since widened to credit-reporting companies, airlines and companies requiring user logins for websites and apps.\\nShoCard Raises Venture Funding\\nNow ShoCard has set its sights on bigger prizes, garnering $4 million in venture funding to steer its new ShoBadge platform to enterprises. This Series A capital infusion was led by existing investors Morado and AME Cloud Ventures, with new backers Storm Ventures, Danhua Capital, Correlation Ventures, Recruit Strategic Partners and Robert Tinker, founder and former CEO of MobileIron.\\nWith ShoBadge, employee ID information is stored encrypted on the employee’s mobile device, then verified through the blockchain, creating user-centric identity storage and paving the way toward a Bring Your Own Identity (BYOID) policy, the company said.\\nThe idea is to eliminate easily compromised usernames and passwords traditionally used to gain access to the network and data, instead using a blockchain-based digital identity verification and authentication process.\\n\"Eliminating usernames and passwords at the enterprise level will close the security gap in organizations\\' cyber defenses,” Armin Ebrahimi, ShoCard founder and CEO said. “Large databases filled with this sensitive information will no longer be necessary, and weak passwords, easily exploited by hackers, will no longer exist.”\\nShoCard: Partner Opportunities?\\nThe ShoBadge platform, which is intended to complement an existing single sign-on process, extends beyond employee ID management to partners, sales channels, contractors and third-parties needing access to an enterprise’s systems.\\nIt’s here where partners may have a play, depending, of course, on ShoCard’s interest in broadening the reach of its platform beyond what it can touch on its own. In that regard, the company may have somewhat of a ready-made template. Late last year, IBM launched a Blockchain partner ecosystem that includes systems integrators, independent software vendors and enterprise developers.\\nIBM’s thinking is to accelerate the goal of Blockchain networks, theoretically driving more value as each new Blockchain partner or service joins the ecosystem.\\nIt’s early but there’s promise for partners.

The Murthy Law Firm was a proud sponsor of this April 11th event, attended by founder and president, Sheela Murthy, attended along with a large contingent of attorneys from our firm.\\nThis year’s honorees include:\\n- Shireen Alihaji, the daughter of Iranian and Ecuadorian parents, now a Los Angeles filmmaker and musician, whose work explores immigrant perspectives and aims at universal understanding.\\n- Suamhirs Rivera, a native of Honduras who was brought to America as a teenager, by human traffickers, and who has become a prominent advocate for abused and traumatized children.\\n- Cristeta Comerford, who started her culinary career in the United States after emigrating from the Philippines, and worked her way up the ranks to become Executive Chef at the White House.\\n- General Colin Powell, the son of Jamaican immigrants, who has served his country for more than 50 years in several high-profile military and diplomatic positions: his appointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff capped a 35-year military career. He served as U.S. Secretary of State under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005.\\nIn a moving tribute to his immigrant parents, General Powell recounted some of the important lessons they imparted, lessons he took to heart: always work hard, and never – ever – bring shame upon yourself or your family. Looking back, General Powell said, he still finds it remarkable to have ascended the pinnacles of power as the son of immigrants, a public school graduate without family wealth or connections or elite schooling to boost his prospects. And yet, he said, in making this climb, he had a special advantage: the values instilled by his parents and his immigrant neighbors in the Harlem of the 1940s and 50s. These uplifting lessons carried him to the exalted rank of four-star General, and to the most important position in the President’s cabinet: Secretary of State.\\nAll the honorees spoke eloquently about their immigrant roots. Their stories testified to the immigrant values that continue to build this nation, and to the unique opportunities our country holds for those who work hard and play by the rules. The common thread? The honorees shared an “attitude of gratitude” for the chance to succeed here – for all the things they never could have achieved in the old country. It was a wonderful celebration of everything that makes this country great!\\nCopyright © 2013, MURTHY LAW FIRM. All Rights Reserved',\n",

This will be the first time all three cars will be displayed as a tribute to the man whose name is on the cars. Featured in the display will be the silver 1994 Callaway LM #001, a Silver 1997 Callaway C7R, and a red, white, and blue 2001 Callaway C12R. Each car is made even more special by its unique history during the legendary races, which we’re sure will be available to read about by an accompanying plaque next to the car. Finally, Saturday will have a remembrance event on the main stage at 3:00 PM local time, celebrating the life of the legendary company founder.',\n",
       " 'At the age of 24, without having seen much of the world, without having spent much time studying people, I published three works within a brief period of ten months – works that were very disparate in themselves. They were reviewed, purchased, read, discussed on many occasions, and wherever I have gone, since I stepped back on to German soil, I was not unknown. Like some beast of legend, people have sought me out, marvelled at me, admired me […]\\nIn the 19th century, Wilhelm Hauff was a kind of superstar on the literary scene. He’d become one of German literature’s classic authors. His novel “Lichtenstein” was a major hit, yet it was outperformed by his novellas “The Man in the Moon” or “From the Memoirs of Satan”. However, his fairy tales made less of a splash back then.\\nIn the 20th century, attitudes changed. To put it in somewhat polemical terms: Wilhelm Hauff – wasn’t that the chap who wrote all those fairy tales? Swabia’s answer to the Thousand and One Nights. While his novels and novellas are only rarely read these days, most people are probably familiar with his fairy tales: The History of Caliph Stork. Little Muck. Or Long-Nose the Dwarf. The stories are about being an outsider and being different, about tolerance and respect for others. Themes that have lost none of their topical relevance.\\nMuch like A Thousand and One Nights, Hauff’s fairy tales are embedded within a frame narrative. They were published in his Fairy Tale Almanac – a three-volume collection. Here’s what Hauff himself had to say about the almanac:\\nIt is intended for girls or boys of twelve to fifteen years of age, and offers seven fairy tales appropriate for that age, mostly in the oriental style. I have attempted to make them as interesting as possible, while always ensuring that they observe a strictly moral attitude, yet without allowing the tales to boil down to a practical application or “fabula docet”.\\nAs a poet, Hauff knew his target audience well. During his time as a tutor, he’d taught the sons of Ernst Eugen, Baron von Hügel, the Württemberg minister of war. Hauff fondly nicknamed his pupils “sea lions”. He wrote his first fairy tales for them.\\nAnd now? Millions of people are still enchanted by Hauff’s fairy tales, which are read almost everywhere in the world.\\nFoto: © Wilhelm-Hauff-Museum',\n",

       " '“Sam Breakstone, get out of the tub!” It’s a phrase I hear in my head every time one of my kids spends too long in the bathtub, their fingers pruny, and at least a pint of soapy water spilled on the floor. The phrase comes from a 1997 ad for Breakstone’s cottage cheese, in which Sam Breakstone has one of his signature epiphanies — this time, to take his cottage cheese out of their tubs and into individual containers, for freshness. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, Sam Breakstone entered the homes of millions of Americans through dozens of ads, but his very existence and the history of the brand touted on the tubs themselves is something of a ruse.\\nFounded in the late 1800s by a pair of Jewish immigrant brothers, Joseph and Isaac Breakstone (originally Bregschtein) from Panemuné, Lithuania, Breakstone’s dairy products — especially butter — are synonymous with Passover. To this day, their butter is the only certified kosher for Passover butter on the market. But the exact origins of this Jewish-owned brand are the subject of some debate. Despite the fact that Breakstone’s products proudly proclaim “Established 1882” on every product, the likelihood of the business being founded that year is incredibly low, according to Jordon Davis, the author of the blog “Finding Sam Breakstone.”\\nCiting Rabbi Jeffrey Marx, a scholar of dairy products and a direct descendent of the Breakstone’s family, Davis shows that Joseph Breakstone immigrated sometime between 1878 and 1882. Isaac followed in 1882. For a few years after that, the two worked as peddlers, possibly living in Pennsylvania. By 1885, they were back in New York, where Joseph opened a grocery store at 27 Orchard Street in Manhattan. Isaac continued to peddle dry goods until 1888, when he entered the dairy market, selling milk and other dairy products. Over the next couple of years, the Breakstone family built their reputation in the world of dairy, with both brothers as well as cousins Morris and Hyman, owning stores of their own.\\nIt wasn’t until 1897 when the family came together under one retail roof, with Joseph, Isaac and Morris starting Breakstone Brothers, a grocery selling fresh food, including dairy products, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. They copyrighted the name in 1906, and in 1907, they began manufacturing dairy products at a small plant in Brooklyn.\\nAccording to a 1982 article in The Anniston Star, “At a time when most American housewives were still churning their own butter and making their own soft cheeses, the brothers brought convenience to their customers. They sold butter from big wooden tubs, dipping scoops to order.” The company was among the first to use trucks to deliver their products. A “cream cheese box spectacular” manufactured by Hoover Bros and Graham Body was made exclusively for Breakstone’s.\\nIn 1912, Breakstone’s began manufacturing from a facility in Walton, NY, allowing them to ramp up production considerably. This would be the location referenced on Breakstone’s packaging for many years: “1882, Walton, NY,” though it reflects neither the true origin of the brand nor the original location. During WWI, Breakstone’s was the largest producer of condensed milk for the armed forces. Then in 1920, the family began to mass market their products to consumers, finally making soft cheeses and other dairy products affordable for the average Jewish consumer, according to Rabbi Marx.\\nIn 1925, Breakstone’s began designating their products as kosher, as mass production opened them up to a largely Jewish audience who could afford their products for the first time. “They are marketing specifically for a Jewish clientele,” Marx explains. “Even their ads in the Jewish Forward are pitched toward Jews. They’re in Yiddish, and they suggest substituting Breakstone’s cream cheese to make all sorts of traditional Jewish dishes. The ads say things like, ‘Your blintzes will taste better when you use Breakstone’s cream cheese.’”\\nThough the exact timing of the kosher for Passover designation for Breakstone’s products is unknown, Marx references his own collection of Breakstone’s memorabilia (on display at the National Museum of Jewish History in Philadelphia), citing two boxes from 1930 with rabbinic hechshers noting that they are kosher for Passover. These are the earliest examples of the designation Marx has found in his research.\\nFifth generation family member Warren Breakstone, another genealogy hobbyist and collector of Breakstone’s memorabilia echoes Marx, saying, “This was a Lower East Side brand, so they were catering to those early customers, and that became an early niche that continues to this day.”\\nHaving grown the business to a regional level by 1928, Joseph and Isaac sold the business to National Dairy Products, a huge conglomerate of dairies and distribution centers that went on to merge with Kraft-Phenix. Joseph retired at the time of the sale, passing away two years later. Isaac, however, continued to serve as the chairman of the board until his death in 1945. Under National Dairy, Marx explains, the brand flourished, finally becoming the household name it is today.\\nIn 1977, another Breakstone was born, so to speak. Sam Breakstone, the persnickety, dairy-obsessed figure that became synonymous with the brand, was created by the Richard K. Manoff Inc. marketing group for Kraft, likely to appeal to consumers by referencing the high standards of what was known as a family brand, though the family was long removed from the business by then.\\nPlayed by Sam Vale (the same actor who portrayed Dunkin’s Fred the Baker), the long suffering dairyman routinely berates his employees, attempting to make a perfect product while being attacked by his dog, a Jack Russel Terrier named Jake. “But if Sam weren’t so demanding,” the ads said, “his cottage cheese (or sour cream, depending on the commercial) wouldn’t be so good.” The commercials featured a fictitious storefront located on Sullivan Street between Houston and Prince, about a mile and a half from the original Breakstone grocery store.\\nIn 1981, Kraft published a slim cookbook called “Sam Breakstone’s Favorite Recipes,” which included just under 30 dairy-based recipes, like Mrs. Breakstone’s Coffee Cake and something called Sam’s Corny Casserole, a warmed up heart attack of corn and zucchini suspended in sour cream, cottage cheese and butter. The fictitious Breakstone continued to represent the brand well into the 1990s, until Vale retired in 1997.\\nThough the family had long since gone on to other pursuits by the time of his commercials, Sam Breakstone carried the family name and reputation forward for new generations to identify with and enjoy (irascible though he was). After several sales, mergers and reports of declining dairy sales, Kraft (now the Kraft Heinz Company) sold Breakstone’s to Lactalis in 2020, as part of a larger restructuring. No longer involved directly in the business, descendants like Warren Breakstone and Rabbi Marx still take an unmistakable tone of pride when recounting the history of this immigrant-founded family business, one known for high standards and high quality.',\n",
       " 'A vital charity who work with young people experiencing emotional, physical or sexual abuse have been fighting exploitation in Harrow for 10 years. We discover how the expansion of internet use and cultural barriers are presenting the latest challenges in keeping teenagers safe.\\nFor parents, the challenge to safeguard their children is ever increasing as social media opens the door into a world of potential exploitation and abuse.\\nOf course, the traditional hurdles that can lead teenagers into danger, self-harm – or even to feel suicidal – still exist: isolation, the breakdown of a family, crime and stress, however the WISH Centre\\'s director Rowena Jaber and her dedicated team have had to adapt to the challenges of the new age in their 10 years of working in Harrow.\\nThe charity, based in Peel Road, Wealdstone, works with 200 young people every year face to face who are struggling to cope, and have seen the landscape change first hand.\\nRowena recounts several instances of young people being pressured into performing sex acts which are filmed on a phone and then used to blackmail them in what becomes a cycle of abuse. The tragedy: Many of the teenagers which come to WISH for help are girls aged 13 to 15, referred to the charity by their school and in a constant fear of being shamed.\\nMuch of what WISH do is try to understand the ways in which young people use the internet as a way of engaging in preventative work which they feel many parents are not always capable of doing.\\n\"I think parents do not have a clue about how their children are using the internet,\" Rowena said. \"Kids and teens may be high achievers and do well in school, but when they\\'re upstairs in their room on their laptop they could be doing anything online. That is what we here try to do: keep up with the vehicles that they are using in their lives.\"\\nThe core message WISH want to convey to parents is to communicate with your children, because studies they have carried out in the streets of Harrow and Wealdstone have produced concerning evidence.\\nThe data, taken this year, showed that 64 per cent know of young people know someone who has met up with someone they know on the internet, and 39 per cent know someone who has been pressured to pose in a sexual manner.\\nWISH\\'s lead practitioner for sexual violence, Matilda De Santis, explained: \"When young people do this, they are leaning on sexual attention as a validation and they do not know what to look for in identifying a threat until it is too late. Sometimes, they are not even aware it is happening and they do not know it is abuse.\"\\nA primary concern to WISH is that they believe from their work that the cultural make up of Harrow is struggling to reconcile itself with these latest challenges.\\n\"The big thing in the media now is that it is Asian men are targeting white girls. In Harrow, it is a different story,\" Rowena added. \"Here you have Asian men targeting Asian girls, because they know and understand the culture, they know how to pressurise and manipulate them into doing what they do not want to do.\"\\nRowena\\'s message to parents is to actively communicate with children on the problems in their lives, because there is too much at stake to let them being exposed to a cycle of exploitation.\\n\"It\\'s about them not being aware that by their children doing well in school and having a good family with a respect for their cultural values and history, they are also a part of teenage culture and the pressures that come along with that.\\n\"Sexual abuse is a taboo subject among the Asian community really. Their community needs to start thinking about this issue and recognising that many of these problems stem from young men in their own community.\"\\nWISH are funded through donations from Children in Need, Sport Relief and are launching an awareness campaign called Harrow Shield through funding they have received from the Mayor of London.\\nFor more information, visit www.thewishcentre.org.uk.',\n",

       " 'Back in the old days – okay, it was just a few years ago – I would stand outside my condo in East Austin and have a few cold Lone Stars. My neighbors – the real ones, not the kind that just walk by and say, “Hi,” and pretend that’s being friendly, because they’re obviously robots – would inevitably show up to hang out, so it became the community meeting spot. Some would bring their children; some would bring their dogs. I didn’t have either, but I did have Billy Idol.\\nBilly Idol was the neighborhood cat whose top lip was permanently hitched up in a snarl on the right side, which led me to giving him his moniker. He was shaggy looking, and quite aloof. If you left your front door open he was the kind that would walk in and act like he owns the place. It was all very “Rebel Yell.”\\nOne night, my neighbors with their Big Dog in tow, got to meet Billy Idol as well. Their Big Dog saw him first, and – like Big Dogs do – growled and looked quite imposing. His only mistake was – like the rest of us, I suppose – thinking Billy Idol didn’t care. Right as I told the neighbors not to worry about Billy Idol, he launched himself through the air and landed – all four feet first – on Big Dog’s face. Needless to say, chaos ensued.\\nPoint being – sometimes you’re the Big Dog, sometimes you’re the small cat and sometimes you’re the small cat named Billy Idol.\\nAll-Louisiana Top 12\\n#1 Southeastern Lions (20-6)\\nMeet the new big dogs of our Top 12…some cats from Hammond. The Lions are ripping through everyone in their path, as the team has won 14 games in a row – the school’s longest win streak. This past week, the team followed two shutout victories, by posting 18 or more runs in their next two contests. The Lions are set to terrorize Nicholls State this weekend, and then head to the Crescent City for a major clash with Tulane next Tuesday.\\n#2 Tulane Green Wave (18-7)\\nSpeaking of which, the Green Wave knocked a big dog off their shoulder this week, as Tulane beat LSU, 7-1, in Baton Rouge for the first time in nine years. The game included this Play of the Year candidate by Stephen Alemais. Tulane has won six games in a row, thanks, in part, to an improving relief pitching staff (which now includes the surprising addition of Jeremy Montalbano). Major props to freshman pitching ace, Ross Massey, who has been lights out, sporting an ERA of 1.14.\\n#3 LSU Tigers (16-8)\\nExpectations can be rough, and expectations not met can be downright brutal. There is a lot of handwringing and “whoa-as-me” coming out of Baton Rouge right now, as the young Tigers dropped a series in College Station, and then of course got beat by Tulane in Alex Box stadium. The problem is that the bats have disappeared, and the fan base doesn’t seem to be in the mood to wait for the team to find them.\\n#4 New Orleans Privateers (17-8)\\nUNO is facing its first crossroads of the season – are they a Big Dog or little cat, the rest of the way? The Privateers suffered through their first bitter weekend series, getting swept by Lamar. My money is on more success coming from Coach Dean’s team. Either way, UNO sports fan, always remember…this team’s combined record over the previous three seasons is 32-122.\\n#5 UL-Lafayette Ragin’ Cajuns (16-9)\\nLove the name, but not loving what I’m seeing from the team. We’re just too far into the season for them to be this average. The Cajuns are running out of opportunities for big non-conference wins, and recently lost a conference series to Arkansas-Little Rock (12-12). Their win over Rice in Minute Maid Park seems like it happened years ago.\\n#6 Louisiana Tech Bulldogs (14-7)\\nThe only actual dogs on our list have had a solid campaign. Two early victories over Top 25 teams set the pace, and although its slowed down a touch, the Bulldogs have won five of their last six – including a conference series win over Charlotte, a team that was looking down at the Bulldogs in Conference USA’s preseason poll – a poll which had the Bulldogs finishing next to last.\\n#7 McNeese State Cowboys (13-9)\\nThe Cowboys swept through Abilene Christian in impressive fashion, and have won five of their last six. In related news, I met a former baseball player from McNeese State at Ancora Pizza on Freret last week. We talked about baseball, and, as always I pretended to listen as he told me about the menu. He was a cool dude, and the Neapolitan-style pizza was superb.\\n#8 Northwestern State Demons (14-11)\\nThe only All-Louisiana baseball team cool enough to rock a bifurcated tail and forked tongue hasn’t been setting the conference aflame lately. The Demons were picked to challenge Southeastern for the Southland conference title, but the two teams seem to be on different levels so far.\\n#9 Nicholls State Colonels (11-15)\\nWhile their 5-4 victory over South Alabama (18-7) is encouraging, the Thibodaux posse must still be scratching their heads over the team’s 2-7 start in the Southland conference. And next up? The Southeastern Lions. Gulp.\\n#10 UL-Monroe Warhawks (10-15)\\nEvery time I say this team’s name, I follow it with an awesome impersonation of an Eagle’s cry.\\n#11 Grambling State Tigers (10-14)\\nThe only All-Louisiana baseball school too cool to ever update their schedule with scores, which I assume the school paid for that website, so that seems like a waste of tax dollars, to which I say…Thanks Bobby Jindal.\\n#12 Southern University Jaguars (8-14)\\nThis team is starting to put some wins together. The Jaguars play a series against SWAC-rival Texas Southern, before heading across town to play LSU next week. A game that, if the Jaguars win, will make the LSU fan base’s collective minds melt.\\nWhich is exactly what happened to that Big Dog, and my neighbors, that night in East Austin. They were less than pleased, I was stifling a grin, and I swear to you that, as I watched Billy Idol walk away, his snarl turned into a smile.',\n",

Or, at least increase the likely hood of it happening. We all know negative, anxious people who are always experiencing disasters, and positive, determined people who have all the luck.\\nI believe in luck, but not in the traditional sense of the whimsical winds of fate but, instead, as a function of focused belief and action.

In the NFL, for example, they all take the same brutal punishment. Yet some guys are always getting injured and pulling their big toe or whatever, and then other guys can get absolutely creamed pullin one down over the middle and walk away like nothing happened. Actually, technically, they’re all playing injured, but some of them refuse to be distracted by discomfort.\\nAnother thing I like about the SDTS because it is the rare day when I feel like I am at at a perfect 100 percent functioning level. There’s always discomfort – *always* the potential for distraction and loss of focus. Could even just be emotional. Dealing with drama or whatever.\\nWe’re all playing injured in this life.\\nAs far as self-defense goes, no techniques and tactics in the world will save a guy who isn’t *committed.* Who doesn’t have serious *intent* with no excuses.\\nI appreciate your feedback, and your SDTS is truly a thing of beauty and simple genius. In fact, the simplicity of it makes it *easier* to focus the mind because one isn’t all confused trying to remember overly-sophisticated techniques. I may seem smart, but that’s because I love simple.\\nI’ll check out the book on the Spartans. I love reading. Here in Michigan we have the Michigan State Spartans, and I’ve always thought that the coaches there ought to make their players study the Spartans since that is quite a name to brand yourself with.

       " 'After more than 18 months of travel restrictions and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has substantially revised its approach and will no longer restrict entry into the United States based on geography. Effective November 8, 2021, the COVID-19-related travel bans have been replaced by vaccination and testing requirements without regard to physical presence in a particular region or country.\\nDespite these less restrictive entry requirements, international travel still poses risks. Due to the limited availability of visa appointments, we continue to advise caution regarding international travel for those who must apply for a visa before returning to the United States. Everyone considering international travel is urged to carefully consider the risks and be fully aware of how ongoing conditions may impact travel.\\nThe official Presidential Proclamation making this change can be found here. This new Proclamation relies on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidance for vaccination and negative testing criteria as referenced in the links below.\\nThe CDC’s general page for COVID-19 exposure related to travel can be found here.\\nThere is also a helpful CDC document with technical instructions to airlines that can be found here.\\nThis new Proclamation revamps restrictions for “noncitizen nonimmigrant” international travelers entering the United States. Travel guidance is already in place for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and remains unchanged. The new policy replaces the country-specific travel bans with a policy that applies to virtually all nonimmigrant individuals, regardless of country of origin or physical presence. In exchange for country-specific bans, this new policy will be based on vaccination status and testing negative for COVID-19.\\nVaccination Required for Nonimmigrant Travelers\\nBeginning November 8, 2021, all nonimmigrant travelers entering the U.S. must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to board U.S.–bound flights. In limited situations, unvaccinated nonimmigrant travelers may still enter the U.S., but they must meet certain exception criteria and comply with additional restrictions. The new Proclamation’s general rule is that unvaccinated nonimmigrants are not permitted to enter the U.S.\\nVaccines accepted for travel to the U.S. are listed on the CDC website and currently include:\\nThe exceptions permitting unvaccinated nonimmigrants to enter the U.S. include the following groups:\\n- Persons on diplomatic or official foreign government travel\\n- Children under age 18\\n- Those with documented medical contraindications for receiving a vaccination;\\n- Participants in certain COVID-19 vaccine trials\\n- Those issued a humanitarian or emergency exception (This category must obtain approval from the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in advance of travel)\\n- Those entering on valid visas (other than visitors for business or tourism) from countries with limited vaccine availability\\n- Members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their spouses and children\\n- Crew members traveling by sea and certain air crew members\\n- Others whose entry is in the national interest of the U.S.\\nThe vaccine-excepted categories are only those listed above. The prior exemptions to the geographic travel ban for certain family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residences, for instance, do not apply.\\nThe CDC Technical Instructions provide details of the documentation required to demonstrate eligibility for each exception category. Those who travel by air to the United States under one of these exceptions will also be required to attest that they are excepted from the requirement to present proof of vaccination. Based on the category of the exception, they may further be required to attest that:\\n- They will be tested with a COVID-19viral test 3-5 days after arrival in the United States, unless they have documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days;\\n- They will self-quarantine for a full 7 days, even if the test result to the post-arrival viral test is negative, unless they have documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days; and\\n- They will self-isolate if the result of the post-arrival test is positive or if they develop COVID-19 symptoms.\\nBased on the category of the exception, those intending to stay in the United States for longer than 60 days may also be required to attest that:\\n- They agree to be vaccinated against COVID-19; and\\n- They have arranged to become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 within 60 days of arriving in the United States, or as soon thereafter as is medically appropriate, unless (for children) they are too young to be vaccinated.\\nThe CDC website includes a helpful Travel Assessment that indicates travel requirements in response to individualized responses, which can be accessed here.\\nNegative COVID-19 Test Result Required for All Air Travelers\\nIn addition to the vaccination requirements replacing the geographic restrictions, all international air passengers destined for the United States continue to be required to provide a negative COVID-19 test result in order to board U.S.–bound flights. As an alternative to a negative COVID-19 test result, international travelers may present documentation of recovery from COVID-19, including a positive viral test result within 90 days and letter from a health care provider or public health official clearing them for travel. All passengers must present the negative test result or proof of recovery from COVID-19 before boarding the flight.\\nFor vaccinated travelers, the viral test must be on a specimen collected no more than 3 calendar days before the departure of the passenger’s U.S.–bound flight. Unvaccinated travelers must present a negative viral test result for a specimen collected no more than 1 calendar day before the departure of the passenger’s U.S.–bound flight. Note that parents traveling with children may have different testing timeline requirements based on differing vaccination status.\\nTesting requirements have been in place since January 2021, and apply to all air passengers traveling to the United States, 2 years of age or older, including U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.\\nReopening of Canada and Mexico Land Borders\\nTravel restrictions across the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico, which barred U.S. entry of nonimmigrants for travel considered “non-essential,” are also being eased. Effective November 8, 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will begin allowing fully vaccinated travelers from Mexico or Canada to enter the United States at land and ferry ports of entry (POEs) for non-essential reasons. Travelers will be required to have appropriate paperwork that provides proof of vaccination. Individuals who have not been fully vaccinated for COVID-19 will not be allowed to travel for non-essential purposes from Canada and Mexico into the United States via land and ferry POEs. Entry into the U.S. on a work visa has generally been considered “essential” travel and has not been restricted.\\nBeginning in January 2022, all inbound foreign national travelers crossing into the U.S. from Canada or Mexico via land or ferry ports of entry — whether for essential or non-essential reasons — must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and provide proof of vaccination. This delayed implementation is intended to provide ample time for essential travelers such as truckers, students, and health care workers to get vaccinated.\\nThere is no information suggesting that there will be any exceptions to the new vaccination requirements. However, note that this change applies only to entry through land or ferry ports. Air travel from Canada and Mexico would follow the vaccination guidelines for worldwide U.S.–bound air travel detailed above.\\nVisa Processing Remains Limited\\nThe lifting of geographically focused travel restrictions will substantially ease international travel, but challenges will remain. For those who do not have a valid visa for return to the U.S., either because their status was changed in the U.S. or a prior visa has expired, obtaining a new visa may still prove difficult. Some consular posts are simply not scheduling routine visa appointments, and others are allowing appointments to be scheduled — sometimes months in the future — only to cancel them. From a practical standpoint, unless one is likely to qualify for an emergency or expedited visa appointment, there is a good chance that a new visa appointment will be difficult to schedule. Individuals eligible to have the in-person visa appointment waived stand the best chance of securing visas by submitting application documents to the U.S. Embassy through drop box or courier services. Each consular post determines the criteria for a waiver of the interview requirement. At a minimum, typically, the consular post requires that the individual have already been granted a visa in the same classification.\\nThose who need to obtain a new nonimmigrant visa should verify the status of visa processing operations at the consular post where they will apply.\\nEntry into the U.S.\\nIn addition to the COVID-19 vaccination and test requirements, when entering the U.S. following international travel, foreign nationals should be prepared to answer questions from a Customs and Border Protection officer regarding the nature of proposed entry and qualifications for a designated waiver or exemption. All foreign nationals should carry documentation evidencing status as well as any documentation supporting the individual’s specific exemption from the vaccination requirement. Visit the Mintz Resources page here for details on required documents for travel.\\nFollowing entry into the U.S., it is critical for individuals to check the I-94 admission record to ensure that it properly reflects their status and authorized stay in the U.S. We recommend verifying the accuracy of Form I-94 details within 48 hours of entering the U.S. in order to correct any errors in a timely manner.',\n",

With only five picks in the 2022 NFL Draft, that seems unlikely.\\nPerhaps Olave falls to the Bears at No. 39, but that might be determined by how well he performs at this week’s NFL Combine. He said Wednesday he intends on doing all the drills and workouts in Indianapolis. Olave knows his 40-time and agility drills will be important, and he witnessed Fields go through it at Ohio State’s Pro Day last year after the 2021 NFL Combine was canceled.\\n“I thought he was going to run a fast 4.3, but he ended up running 4.4,” Olave said. “He slipped at his start so I gotta put that in there.”\\nOn draft night, Fields fell out of the top 10 and the Bears were able to trade up to select him at No. 11.

       " 'Editor\\'s note: Gabrielle Mee, a wealthy Rhode Island widow, directed tens of millions of dollars to the now-disgraced Legion of Christ between 1989 and her death in 2008. Among the volumes of court documents unsealed Friday in a lawsuit brought against the order is a July 12, 2001, deposition of Mee. In that deposition, Mee, who had just turned 90, describes her first contact with the order and her reasons for donating so profusely. This profile of Mee describes the benefactor in her own words as taken from that deposition, unless otherwise specified. See all stories in this series.\\nFor Gabrielle Mee, the Legion of Christ was a group of men uncommonly focused on serving God\\'s people. In a continuing era of personnel shortages for the Catholic church, they seemed among an ever-decreasing number willing to take up a life of service as priests.\\nMee, a native of the small Rhode Island city of Woonsocket on Massachusetts\\' southern and western borders, first heard of the Legion in August 1989.\\nConcerned about a shortage of active priests, she asked a friend at her Narragansett parish: \"What are we going to do when we have no more?\"\\nThe friend mentioned the order, saying they had a \"lot of vocations.\"\\n\"Frankly, I caught fire,\" Mee said of that interaction. \"I thought there must be some priests. So I got home and I called up my banker. I said, \\'Find out everything you can about the Legionaries of Christ.\\' \"\\nVisiting the Legion\\'s formation center in Cheshire, Conn., sometime after talking with her friend, Mee liked what she saw.\\n\"What impressed me so much was to see a chapel filled with all these young men in their cassocks,\" she said.\\nMee\\'s first meeting with Fr. Marcial Maciel Degollado, the Legion\\'s founder and duplicitous con-man who secretly fathered children and sexually abused young boys, would foreshadow a burgeoning financial and personal relationship with the order.\\nMeeting Maciel at the Legion\\'s Connecticut facility sometime after first hearing of the order, the priest told Mee that while the Legion was \"in a crunch\" financially, it would \"only ask God for what we need.\"\\n\"And the angel Gabriel came down from heaven,\" Mee replied, referencing her first name, Gabrielle.\\nThe reference to providence would be just the beginning of blessings the order would receive from the widow.\\nAn Aug. 20, 1989, letter from Maciel to Mee thanks her for a $1 million donation for construction of a Legion seminary in Rome.\\n\"I am deeply moved and very grateful for this extraordinary gift,\" Maciel wrote. \"You have no idea how much good this act of generosity will produce for the church.\"\\nPerhaps sensing Mee\\'s desire for an increase in the number of Catholic priests, Maciel also invited her to come to Rome on Jan. 3, 1991, for the seminary\\'s inauguration, which was to include the ordination of 55 Legion priests.\\n\"That the founder of The Legion of Christ has written to me is just overwhelming!\" Mee replied in a September 1989 handwritten letter of response to Maciel, whom she addressed as \"beloved Father.\"\\n\"How profoundly soul satisfying are God\\'s blessings!\" she wrote, saying she would accept the invitation.\\nThe $1 million gift would be the first of many. By July 25, 1990, a memo from Mee\\'s bank recorded another gift to the Legion of about $3 million in cash and securities.\\nAs the head of a charitable foundation and later trust in honor of her late husband, Timothy, a prominent Rhode Island banker who died in 1985, Mee would provide many more such gifts, eventually directing that 90 percent of her and the trust\\'s holdings, totaling about $30 million, be given to the order at the time of her death.\\nFor Mee, the focus on Catholic giving arose out of a life shaped by devotional practices common to devout U.S. Catholic families in the 1940s and \\'50s.\\nShe and her husband would say the rosary together \"every night.\" And Timothy, she said, \"never missed a Mass. Never.\"\\nIn the Legion, she said she found a group in which she could be \"sure of what they were doing.\"\\n\"I had extreme faith in what they were doing and they\\'re proving today what they are doing,\" she said. \"They\\'re re-Christianizing the entire world.\"\\nWhile Mee may have had that dedication to the order in 2001, she raised questions about how her money was being used several times earlier.\\nFollowing a 1997 Hartford Courant news report by Gerald Renner and Jason Berry outlining accusations by nine men that Maciel had abused them as boys, Mee handwrote a letter to her banker in March 1998.\\nMee\\'s donations to the order came first from a foundation and then a trust named after her husband, which was managed by Fleet Investment Management. Fleet merged with Bank of America in 2004.\\nHer husband, Mee told the banker in 1998, \"always took great care to ensure that the companies he invested in were not marking out cross-purpose with his moral and charitable goals.\" Mee asked for \"written assurance\" that the money given from his trust never be invested in such a way as to \"contradict the moral principles or values taught by the Catholic Church.\"\\nResponding to her March 1998 letter, Dorothy Derick, one of Fleet\\'s vice presidents, wrote to Maciel directly in September 1998 asking for the Legion\\'s \"concurrence\" with Mee\\'s request, for copies of the Legion\\'s investment portfolio, and periodic review of its continuing holdings.\\nSuch inquiries would continue for years, even after Mee\\'s death.\\nIn August 2010, after the Legion had acknowledged for the first time in a March press release that Maciel had taken \"reprehensible actions,\" the vice president of Bank of America\\'s philanthropic department, Vautina Franklin, emailed Fr. Jose Felix Ortega, a Legion priest who helped run the order\\'s operations in Connecticut, asking if the order \"continues to be faithful to the Holy Father.\"\\nWhile Ortega responded in December 2010 in another email referencing an attached letter from the Vatican on the matter, which he said would answer Franklin\\'s inquiry, the Vatican letter has not surfaced in a review of the documents released Friday.\\nBesides her donations to the order, Mee also joined its lay arm, Regnum Christi, as a consecrated woman in November 1991.\\nComposed of separate groups for laywomen, laymen and diocesan priests, Regnum Christi is akin to a religious order and asks its members to profess vows of chastity, poverty and obedience.\\nIts members can choose to become either first-, second- or third-degree members. Each layer of membership places additional responsibilities on members toward the order.\\nA March 25, 1992, certificate indicating her induction into its third degree of membership shows Mee was told her motto while in the order was to be \"Whatever You say I will do. I will comply, through God\\'s chosen instruments.\"\\nAdditionally, she was to take a walk each day, have \"arm exercises daily\" and \"obey ... my directors and those Nuestro Padre has sent as my angels.\"\\nNuestro Padre, Spanish for \"Our Father,\" was a title Legion members frequently used to refer to Maciel.\\nAs a member of Regnum Christi, Mee was also expected to hand over her assets as part of her vow of poverty.\\nAccording to a 2007 copy of its 28-page statutes, all Regnum Christi third-degree members are to \"renounce ... their licit right to use and exercise ownership over any material good without the permission of their legitimate directors.\"\\nAdditionally, \"anything a consecrated member acquires through his work or as a donation, and everything he receives as a salary, pension, grant or insurance, regardless of how it is obtained, is to be sent to the general fund of the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ.\"\\nAnd: \"After fifteen years of consecrated life, a member is to donate half of his assets to the general fund, and after twenty-five years, all of his present and future assets.\"\\nApproving a version of those statutes in November 2004, the Vatican\\'s congregation for religious life said they were a vision of Christ\\'s kingdom.\\n\"The Apostolic See warmly prays that the members of the Regnum Christi Movement by faithfully following these Statutes will make them a further and effective means to extend Christ\\'s Kingdom in the world,\" wrote Cardinal Franc Rode, then the head of the congregation, in an official letter.\\nFor her part, Mee said she had been considering religious life since she was a child, when the order of the Religious of Jesus and Mary, which to this day maintains a mission center in Woonsocket, asked her to join.\\nAfter her husband\\'s death, she said, \"I knew that I had to do something.\"\\nRegnum Christi, she said, \"were doing much of what I\\'d been doing. I was a daily person going to Mass and I got to know a lot about them and I decided, well, that was the way I was going to go.\"\\nHer story, Mee said, ends: \"And she lived happily ever since. Continuation of the bliss and happiness I had with my marriage with Tim. Joyful life. Very nice. Totally fulfilled.\"\\n[Joshua J. McElwee is an NCR staff writer.

       " 'World Bank’s Malpass Weighed Changes That Threatened China Rank\\nWorld Bank’s Malpass Weighed Changes That Threatened China Rank\\n(Bloomberg) -- World Bank President David Malpass discussed altering the methodology of a high-profile report ranking countries’ business climates in ways that threatened to hurt China’s standing.\\nThose talks came more than a year before senior officials suspended publication of the report, which was ultimately quashed last week after an outside audit cited pressure over an earlier edition by then-top official Kristalina Georgieva, now head of the International Monetary Fund.\\nThe discussions took place shortly after Malpass, a China critic while he served as the top Treasury international official under President Donald Trump, became World Bank chief in April 2019, according to internal bank documents and people familiar with the events. They came after several years in which China had surged in the annual Doing Business rankings as a result of reforms pushed by Beijing.\\nThe bank suspended publication of the often-controversial report in August 2020, citing “data irregularities” that had been found in previous years’ editions. That move also came after Malpass and other senior officials had been briefed on the rankings for that edition, known as Doing Business 2021, according to people familiar with the events.\\nThe unreleased Doing Business 2021 report, which people familiar with it said was ready for publication and was seen by Bloomberg News, showed China rising to 25th in the world, from 31st in the previous year’s report. The report showed the U.S. holding at sixth. It was originally slated for release in October 2020 before being delayed and last week shelved for good.\\nThis story is based on internal World Bank documents and interviews with more than a dozen people involved in the project over the last four years. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, and some cited fear of retaliation from bank management.\\nIn a response to questions from Bloomberg News, the World Bank said the 2021 edition had been paused due to data irregularities first raised by staff members in June 2020. It declined to confirm the rankings in the unreleased report and denied that China’s standing or other rankings had played any role in the decision.\\nIn addition, any proposed changes to methodology were part of an institution-wide review, and Malpass didn’t pressure staff to consider any actions that would have affected the rankings of China or the U.S., the World Bank said.\\n“Any changes that were considered in Doing Business methodology were developed by technical Doing Business staff, consulted upon widely within the bank and reviewed as part of a standing bank-wide process informed by years of previous work,” World Bank spokesman David Theis said. Any suggestion otherwise owes to “unnamed sources with axes to grind.”\\nMalpass declined a request for an interview or comment.\\nThe audit released last week, conducted by law firm WilmerHale, concluded that Malpass’s predecessor Jim Yong Kim and his top lieutenant Georgieva pressured staff to change the data to benefit China in the 2018 edition of the report. Georgieva has said she “fundamentally” disagrees with the audit’s conclusions; Kim didn’t respond to requests for comment.\\nThe World Bank decided to discontinue Doing Business because “trust in it as a brand and as an index was too severely damaged to repair,” Malpass said in an internal note to staff Sept. 17.\\nIn its response to Bloomberg News, the World Bank said the WilmerHale report spoke for itself. The law firm’s probe, which remains ongoing, focused on the 2018 and 2020 editions of the report. The audit said it didn’t identify any involvement in data changes by Malpass’s office related to the 2020 report, which was released in October 2019.\\nHowever, documents seen by Bloomberg News indicate Malpass was engaged in discussions about altering methodology in a way that would potentially have hurt China’s ranking in Doing Business 2021, an edition not addressed in the WilmerHale review.\\nAround June 2019, more than a year before the August 2020 decision to withhold publication, Malpass discussed a proposal to double the number of representative cities in the report to four for the three countries with the largest population: China, India and the U.S., according to internal documents.\\nHe also discussed restoring an ease of employment metric that had been dropped amid opposition from Democrats in Congress. Including that metric would have caused China’s ranking to fall four places and the U.S.’s to rise by three, the documents show.\\n“Just wanted to let you know informally that DM [Malpass] recently agreed with the Doing Business team to increase the number of cities from 2 to 4 covered by the index for countries with population over 300 million,” one of Malpass’s assistants wrote in a June 2019 email, seen by Bloomberg News, to other senior World Bank staff. “This impact [sic] China, India and United States. In China, the sample will include the third and fourth largest business cities: Chongqing and Guangzhou.”\\nIn the email Malpass’s assistant said the president would be discussing it with senior Chinese officials. She also pointed to restoring the “Employing Workers” indicator, which if included “may impact China negatively.”\\nIn December 2019, Malpass wrote then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that while the bank had been considering restoring the indicator, it decided to leave it out of the rankings after “input from you and other stakeholders,” according to a letter released by the House Financial Services Committee.\\nThe change in the number of cities was rejected for Doing Business 2021 after staff looked at the work involved, according to a February 2020 internal World Bank memo.\\nThe data for the Doing Business 2021 covered the period through May 1, 2020, with staff preparing their initial analyses and circulating them internally for discussion over the summer.\\nThe bank announced on Aug. 27, 2020, that it was suspending publication of the Doing Business report, citing “data irregularities,” and ordering reviews of the matter. This came more than two years after former chief economist Paul Romer raised questions about changes to the report’s methodology that made rankings volatile.\\nWhat the World Bank didn’t say, however, was that days before the August 2020 announcement, Malpass and other top bank officials were presented with rankings for the 2021 edition of the report showing China advancing, people familiar with the matter said.\\nIn its response to Bloomberg News, the World Bank said the Doing Business 2021 report’s release had been paused since August 2020 because concerns were raised by staff in June 2020 about data integrity.\\nThe unreleased Doing Business 2021 report seen by Bloomberg News, however, shows that its authors wrote they had addressed the data irregularities raised and that they had found no other issues amid more rigorous scrutiny than before. “All data in Doing Business 2021 received three levels of formal review and approval in the data management system, implementing checks and balances,” the authors wrote.\\nThe World Bank said in its response to Bloomberg News that the series was ultimately discontinued because the recent reviews and audits identified additional concerns.\\nThe episode has illustrated how the World Bank and IMF’s top officials are increasingly squeezed between the geopolitical ambitions of the world’s two largest economies. The U.S. has been the biggest shareholder at both institutions since their advent in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, at the close of World War II. China has been advocating for a larger role in the past decade. The two countries are locked in a trade war and are also jockeying for strategic position in the Indo-Pacific region.\\nMalpass, 65, became World Bank president in April 2019 after being nominated by Trump for the job traditionally occupied by a U.S. pick. In his previous post as the U.S. Treasury’s undersecretary for international affairs he was a regular critic of China and its growing role in the global economy. He was also a skeptic of the country’s reform credentials.\\nBefore joining the Trump administration, Malpass spent more than a decade as an economist at Bear Stearns Cos. He had served prior Republican presidents, worked as an aide on Capitol Hill and run unsuccessfully for the party’s nomination for U.S. Senate in New York in 2010.\\nIn November 2018 testimony to a Senate subcommittee while he was at Treasury, Malpass bemoaned the “substantial inroads” China had made into multilateral development banks like the World Bank.\\n“We are working with allies and like-minded countries to guide the MDBs away from what could be viewed as endorsement of China’s geopolitical ambitions,” Malpass said.\\nAs well as giving validation to its policies, a further gain for China in the rankings could have been an embarrassment for Trump as he campaigned for re-election on both what he hailed as a pro-business record and his economic war against the Asian power. It also would have likely complicated Malpass’s relationship with Trump’s White House and Treasury Department.\\nThe Doing Business series has long been both controversial and influential, with nations often lobbying for changes in their rankings. The bank has also for years conducted a parallel business selling consulting services to countries on how to improve their rankings -- a practice that reviews have flagged as a conflict of interest.\\nIn a report not released publicly but seen by Bloomberg News, the bank’s internal watchdog questioned just how much impact the Doing Business reports really had on member economies. But it also detailed the broad scope of that work.\\n“Doing Business also informs a substantial share of the World Bank Group’s projects providing financing, advice, and/or technical assistance to client countries on the business environment,” according to the report, dated Sept. 8. That “DB-informed portfolio” consisted of 676 projects worth $15.5 billion in World Bank loans from fiscal 2010 to 2020.\\nEven with the issues swirling around the report, the decision to cancel it surprised many board members and employees just weeks before the World Bank and IMF are scheduled to hold their annual meetings, the year’s biggest event for the lenders. Dozens of staff worked on the high-profile project and now need to be reassigned; almost 15,000 “local partners” in 191 economies around the world helped collect data.\\nIn addition, work on the 2022 edition of the report was largely complete but without rankings, people familiar with the matter said. They said a recent plan was to release both the delayed 2021 and new 2022 reports together in December of this year.\\nIn its response, the World Bank said it had never had a firm timeline for the release of any further Doing Business reports, as they were dependent on the outcome of various investigations.\\nMauricio Cardenas, a former Colombian finance minister who led an independent experts’ review of the report’s methodology released this week, said all of the discussions that panel had with bank officials in recent months were focused on how to reform the report rather than whether to discontinue it.\\n“We had many meetings with many different groups within the bank. There were many criticisms, but it was always focused on reforms, changes,” he said in a phone interview. “If there’s no Doing Business, something needs to fill that space.”\\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',\n",
       " 'Democrat Patrick Leahy’s announcement that he will retire after eight terms in the Senate has set off a scramble in Vermont over the rare opening in the state’s tiny congressional delegation.\\nWhile political observers expect Democratic Rep. Peter Welch to be a leading candidate if he decides to run for the seat in 2022, there is also pressure for Vermont to elect a woman. It’s the only state in the nation to never send a woman to Congress.\\nThe opening provides an opportunity for Vermont to rid itself of that distinction, said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, on Tuesday.\\n“It would be a good thing for Vermont to have some diversity in its representation in Washington to represent some of the diversity in the state,” she said. “The fact that Vermont has never had a woman’s voice representing it in Washington, D.C., with that set of life experience, with that sort of understanding of another dimension to policy questions, it’s a loss for the state of Vermont.”\\nGet New England news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NECN newsletters.\\nThe last time Vermont had an open seat was in 2006, when Bernie Sanders, then a congressman, succeeded Jim Jeffords as a U.S. senator and Welch, then president of the state Senate, took Sanders’ spot in the state’s only U.S. House seat.\\nAmong the possible candidates for Leahy’s Senate seat is Democratic Lt. Gov. Molly Gray, said Garrison Nelson, a retired University of Vermont political science professor and a congressional scholar. But Nelson noted that Gray, a former Burlington attorney who has served as lieutenant governor since January, doesn’t have much political experience.\\nOther names being floated include Vermont Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint and state Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, both Democrats. Ram Hinsdale said Tuesday that she is considering running for the House if Welch runs for the Senate.\\n“It would be a shock to Vermonters if he decided not to run,” she said of Welch.\\nWelch, who praised Leahy after his retirement announcement, said Tuesday that he will make a decision about his political future “in the coming days.” If he does run for Leahy’s Senate seat, Nelson noted that Welch is 74, not much younger than Sanders, now 80, and Leahy, 81.\\nWelch has developed a spot for himself in the House and is well-liked there, so “this is an intensely personal choice for someone like him,” said Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College.\\nRepublicans are likely to struggle fielding a competitive candidate in the liberal state, Nelson said, especially since GOP Gov. Phil Scott has said he’s not interested in running.\\nThe state Republican Party chair sent out a statement after Leahy’s announcement saying they have “an incredible opportunity to recruit the kind of high caliber candidate to win this seat and make Vermont more competitive than ever before.”\\nRepublican Scott Milne, a travel industry executive who unsuccessfully challenged Leahy in 2016, would not say Tuesday whether he is considering running again. He did say, however, that he was unsure whether Welch would be the right person to bring needed change in a “dysfunctional” Washington.\\nFowler noted that it might take a while for prospective candidates to decide whether to mount a campaign, so any speculation right now is premature.\\n“In my experience with potential candidates, they have to look at their finances, where their kids are in school and what their spouse thinks,” she said.\\nBut Fowler noted that Leahy has given potential candidates ample time to figure out what they want to do, given that his announcement came a year before the 2022 election.\\n“It’s just one more mark of the fact that he’s a very classy guy,” she said.',\n",
       " 'As the page turns and we put 2021 in the rear-view, a lot of people are asking what 2022 may hold for the occupational medicine (OccMed) industry. In this article, we’re going to look at three expected trends for OccMed that we plan to see in 2022. Additionally, we’ll share some actionable steps that organizations can take to get ahead of the curve and position themselves for success in the new year.\\n1. A Shift from Reactivity to Proactivity\\nIn the last two years, the industry has been plagued with unexpected twists and turns as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE). And while every year in healthcare brings some sort of new and unique changes, this is the understatement of the century when applied to the past two years. Unfortunately, as we move into 2022, COVID-19 and its variants show no signs of going anywhere.\\nWhile the presence of COVID-19 looks to remain a constant trend, the way in which OccMed teams react will (and should) be changing in 2022. Instead of being as reactionary as we’ve been forced to be over the past two years, we can now shift our approach to a proactive response. Yes, there are still unknowns, but we have so much more information now that we didn’t have years ago. The availability of these resources should empower teams and organizations to approach PHE planning proactively.\\nActionable Step: Put in processes to stay on top of any changes to vaccine mandates and utilize technology to better track compliance. For OccMed providers, this is a unique way to build competitive advantages.\\n2. A New Host of Injuries and Conditions\\nFor OccMed providers, keeping the workforce happy, healthy, and productive is a key component of success. Often, this requires OccMed to analyze the working conditions of their clients and offer proactive solutions to identify and mitigate potential health risks. For many workers, though, those work conditions have changed dramatically over the past two years. As a result of the PHE, many workers now work from home or are required to alter the way in which they work to meet new health-related rules and regulations.\\nAnytime we drastically change working conditions, we also alter risk factors. For example, working from home can mean uncomfortable workspaces that cause injury, changes in stress levels and emotional health, and even increases in unhealthy eating.\\nActionable Step: Make sure you’re planning to prevent as many of these new risk factors as possible to save money on future injuries. Additionally, ensure you’re not still allocating resources to risk factors that are no longer an issue due to changes in work habits or environment.\\n3. The Normalcy of New Technology\\nThroughout the PHE, we saw a big rise in the use of telehealth. As of mid-2021, over 76% of U.S. hospitals were connecting with patients and consulting practitioners at a distance through the use of mobile apps, video, and other technology.1 Prior to the PHE, there was a major barrier to acceptance between patients and providers who struggled to see the efficacy of this treatment method. As COVID-19 made telehealth necessary, many patients (and providers) quickly saw how effective and convenient leveraging this technology really was, regardless of the pandemic.\\nWhat this means for OccMed and healthcare as a whole is that we shouldn’t expect patients to want to abandon this convenience even if and when COVID-19 makes its way to the rear-view.\\nActionable Step: If you haven’t already, start making plans to explore implementing some form of telehealth into your offerings to employers. Additionally, start exploring other potential new technologies like predictive analytics or tech-forward EHR solutions that can help you separate yourself from the pack in what will certainly be a more competitive industry.\\nThe Final Word and a Bonus 2022 OccMed Trend\\nWhat we just alluded to is something that all OccMed practices need to be aware of — the industry will continue to become more and more competitive in 2022. What this means is that it’s critical OccMed providers that want to survive and thrive need to be on the cutting edge of the industry as much as possible.\\nIf you’d like to learn more about how you and your team can do just that, we’d invite you to read our free e-book titled—6 Tactics to Grow and Expand Your OccMed Business. Including insights from Gene Howell, CEO of Reliant Urgent Care, which serves hundreds of patients a day at Los Angeles International Airport, the ebook provides real-world actionable steps you can take today to best position your organization for 2022 in response to these trends.\\n6 Tactics to Grow and Expand Your OccMed Business\\nScale up quickly to guide employers in improving worker health\\n1.

       " 'Rival teams will play second of two Twenty20 matches on Tuesday.\\nImad Wasim took four wickets to spin Pakistan to a 13-run victory over Zimbabwe in the first of two Twenty20 internationals at Harare Sports Club on Sunday.\\nAlthough Zimbabwe put in a disciplined performance with the ball after losing the toss and restricted Pakistan to 136 for eight, they were unable to contend with Wasim’s bowling on a slow pitch and crumbled to 123 for nine in reply. The 26-year-old Wasim finished with figures of 4 for 11 from four overs, and was named man of the match having also contributed 19 runs from just 12 balls.\\n“Everything I touched turned into gold today,” Wasim said. “I tried to bowl wicket-to-wicket and the basics paid off.”\\nSuch a comfortable victory was not always on the cards for Pakistan, who slumped to 29 for three early in their innings as seamer Chamu Chibhabha grabbed three wickets in six deliveries. Their recovery was led by Shoaib Malik, who scored 35 from just 24 balls before he was bowled by a skiddy Sean Williams delivery, and was finished off by Mohammad Rizwan’s unbeaten 33.\\nChibhabha finished with figures of 3 for 18 from three overs, and also took an outstanding catch in the outfield to dismiss Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi late in the innings. That helped Zimbabwe prevent the onslaught at the death that their bowlers have been vulnerable to this year, but they lost in-form Chibhabha to Wasim in the first over of their reply.\\nHamilton Masakadza’s steady 25 kept the hosts in the game as they headed towards the halfway stage of their chase, before Wasim returned to take a wicket in each of his remaining three overs and leave Zimbabwe’s lower order with too much to do.\\nCaptain Elton Chigumbura’s 31 took the match into the last over with Zimbabwe needing 16 to win with two wickets in hand, but debutant Imran Khan held his nerve to secure the win for Pakistan. “We just lost too many wickets at the end,” Chigumbura reflected. “The wicket was a bit slow and difficult, but requiring six runs an over, it was good enough to bat on. We have come close on many occasions but we keep on losing.”\\nThe second T20 international takes place at the same venue on Tuesday, and will be followed by three one-day internationals.',\n",

       " 'More power, faster rollouts, lower costs\\nWind remains one of the most popular and stable sources of renewable energy. In fact, wind is among the world’s fastest growing renewable energy sources, expected to provide 12% of global electricity demand by 2020. Compared to other technologies, from nuclear power to coal, onshore wind can offer energy at the lowest Total Cost of Ownership, taking into account everything from development to maintenance costs.\\nToday, global installed wind energy capacity is almost 487 GW. The European Wind Energy Association expects 320 GW of wind energy capacity will be installed in the EU by 2030, of which 254 GW will be onshore.\\nThe falling cost of wind power, efficiency increases, and attractive policies are expected to boost growth even further. What’s more, the 2015 Paris Climate Summit (COP 21) saw a broad coalition agree to halt global warming at 2°C, or even 1.5° - an important driver for renewables. In addition, wind energy continues to show solid global growth. In many regions around the world, onshore wind is seen as an essential component to the energy transformation, often together with solar energy.\\nCompared to alternatives (nuclear, coal), the CAPEX and OPEX are very attractive. Of course, the faster an installation is completed, the faster it can start producing energy – and generating Return on Investment.\\nWhy wind ?\\n- Wind offers the lowest Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) available. The Annual Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis from leading financial advisory and asset management firm Lazard (November 2017) indicates that wind offers the lowest energy cost of all current technologies – and that’s without factoring in subsidies.\\n- Onshore wind can compete with fossil fuels and other renewables on price – and it is becoming even more so as fossil fuel power costs increase.\\n- Increasing yields thanks to longer blades, taller towers and more powerful generators.\\n- Once wind turbines are up and running, their carbon footprint remains extremely low.\\n- Impact on the environment is limited. It’s possible to farm around onshore wind turbines, which emit no toxins or waste.\\n- Onshore turbines typically have an uptime around 98% and require limited maintenance downtime.\\n- Current turbines already extract almost 50% of energy conveyed in wind.\\n- Technological advances include the ability to harvest energy at low wind speeds.\\nLevelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) makes it possible to compare the cost of energy from different sources. LCOE is calculated by adding up all costs incurred throughout the generating technology’s lifetime divided by the units of energy produced during the lifetime of the project. The result is expressed as units of currency per kilowatt hour.\\nToday, the main challenge is to optimize the layout of a wind farm in order to minimize CAPEX and OPEX while simultaneously maximizing the power output. To do this, we need to examine four questions:\\n- How to build and arrange the Medium Voltage Alternating Current Collector network that connects turbine substations in a way that minimizes CAPEX?\\n- How to decrease OPEX by minimizing the number of joints?\\n- How to maximize output power in a given investment?\\n- How to optimize the cable supply together with the laying process?\\nNexans offers an integrated approach to ‘Balance of Plant’, combining engineering, installation, cables and interconnect product supply. We participate from the earliest stage of your project, offering engineering support to optimize network engineering, based on our expertise in cables and cable laying. From the outset, Nexans Engineering Service Department works with Project Developers and Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) stakeholders to find optimization possibilities.\\nUsing GPS position data, site surveys, soil examinations and data on power generation from each turbines, ampacity of cables and trenches cross-section design, network layout and configuration are optimized. The main outcome is, in most of our projects, a reduction of trenches and cable lengths. The ideal connection and branching points are precisely determined, based on fixed turbine positions. Precisely determining the optimized cable mix, cross-section balance, joint locations, optimized trenches sizes and filling rate make it possible to reduce CAPEX and OPEX whilst maximizing output power generation. Today’s high loads can be transported over greater distances to substations without difficulty.\\nTotal solutions provider utilizing group and partner resources\\n- Engineering competences to support your own engineering team\\n- CAPEX savings based on optimized trenching & cables lengths\\n- OPEX savings based on optimized number of joints\\n- Cable and interconnection solutions compliant with relevant International and Local Standards\\n- Reduction of overall number of joints\\n- Point-to-point circuits for the most effective solutions\\n- Longer cable length per drum\\n- Long length single core cables trefoil on site\\n- Many years of experience in laying very long cables to substations\\n- Single system warranty\\n- Single point of responsibility and liability combines product supply and laying: peace of mind for installers, owners, operators and other stakeholders.\\nInnovative installation methods, combining fully-integrated drum carrier, cable binding and laying solution allows single core cables, trefoiled into three-core cable on site, to be continuously laid together with fiber optic and earthing cables. This unique one-step cable installation solution reduces the number of drums, jointing sections and joints and on-site installation days. It also generates tangible installation cost savings while reducing the number of potential service interruption during plant operation.\\nOur fully integrated solution comes with a single warranty and liability document. It doesn’t only optimize costs and maximize efficiency right away, but also makes sure you’re ready to accommodate ever-increasing turbine output levels.\\nSelect your country to find our products and solutions',\n",

       " 'While turboprop manufacturers are reporting positive growth in sales and turboprops have remained a major component of regional air carriers flying in the world, the United States has not followed world trends. Turboprop fleets and sales are down significantly since the mid-1990s. As of mid-2017, there are no signs indicating that trend is reversing. U.S. air carriers do not have any turboprop airplanes on order; to date, only 300 are currently flying in the country, with an average age of 21 years. Meanwhile, in 2013, total orders for turboprop aircraft only reached 164 aircraft between ATR and Bombardier (a number consistent with industry forecasts for 2014-2033), causing Brazilian manufacturer Embraer to forego re-entry into the turboprop market. However, reports at the 2017 Paris Air Show suggest that the company’s stance might change, with a 90-seat turboprop potentially in the works.\\nRecently, European airframer ATR tried to pitch its turboprop fleets to North America as a low-cost option for shorter routes, potentially replacing regional jets as well as existing turboprops. Currently, their only U.S. customer is FedEx; the last major order by a U.S. firm was placed Mesaba Aviation, a Minneapolis company, in 1996. However, lowered costs of fuel could lead to an eventual resurgence of turboprop craft. Average variable costs per hour, including fuel, tend to run slightly lower for turboprops compared to jets, although so do their carrying capacities and ranges.\\nExisting turboprop fleets worldwide have seen a growing number of safety concerns. In China, the Modern Ark 60 (MA60) has had a poor safety record, with frequent brake, steering, and landing gear failures. Over 11% of such vehicles have been damaged beyond repair since their inception, clouding China’s aviation future. Furthermore, the production company allegedly failed to disclose certain safety information to buyers, despite legal obligations. Meanwhile, in Australia, an incident in 2014 involving a pitch disconnect in an ATR72 has led to greater scrutiny of turboprop manufacturers Virgin and Toll, including monthly reports to the Civil Aviation Safety Agency (CASA). These mechanical issues suggest closer examinations of turboprop planes on the whole.\\n- NTSB noted lack of regulatory requirements or regulatory oversight as a probable cause or contributing factor to several aircraft accidents operated by part 135 commuter air carriers:\\n- Northwest Airlink 5719 (Express II Airlines) – December 1, 1993 (CFIT)\\n- United Express 6291 (Atlantic Coast Airlines) – January 7, 1994 (LOC-I)\\n- American Eagle 3379 (Flagship Airlines) – December 13, 1994 (LOC-I)\\nLoss of expertise and know-how, know-where\\nThe FAA published a final rule requiring most part 135 commuter operators offering scheduled service in turbojets or turboprops with greater than nine seats to operate under 14 CFR part 121.\\nAverage age of the U.S. turboprop fleet is increasing, leading to greater risk of maintenance and safety hazards.',\n",

The natural ingredients in green drinks help to break down food more easily and provide more energy throughout the day.\\nCommon ingredients such as ginger and turmeric have been shown to have positive effects on digestive health, aiding digestion and helping to prevent bloating. Although green drinks can be beneficial for digestive health, there is also a risk of over-consumption. Too much of any one type of green drink can lead to an upset stomach or dizziness, so it's important to consume them in moderation. It's also important to use fresh ingredients when preparing green drinks, avoiding added sugars or preservatives that could potentially be harmful.\\nNatural sweeteners and spices can be added to make green drinks more enjoyable. In order to get the most out of green drinks, it's important to incorporate them into a balanced diet. Regular consumption can lead to a variety of health benefits, such as improved digestion, increased energy levels and improved overall health. Green drinks can also help to reduce the risk of certain diseases and illnesses, so it's important to make them part of your regular diet.\\nIn conclusion, green drinks offer a variety of digestive benefits that can be beneficial for overall health. Different types of green drinks provide a wide range of nutrients, vitamins and minerals that can help to improve digestion and increase energy levels. However, it's important to consume them in moderation and use fresh ingredients when preparing them. Regular consumption can lead to a variety of health benefits, so incorporating green drinks into your regular diet is highly recommended.\\nPotential RisksWhen it comes to green drinks, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with them.\\nOver-consumption of green drinks can lead to an imbalance in the body's natural electrolyte levels, which can cause dehydration, fatigue, and muscle cramps. Additionally, some people may be allergic to certain ingredients in green drinks, such as wheatgrass or barley grass. If you experience any adverse reactions after consuming a green drink, it is important to stop using it and seek medical advice. It is also important to be mindful of the sugar content in green drinks.\\nMany commercial varieties contain added sugar, which can increase your risk of developing cavities or other dental health issues. If you are looking for a healthier option, look for a variety of green drink that is made with natural sweeteners, such as honey or maple syrup.\\nBenefits of Green DrinksGreen drinks are a great way to improve your digestion, as they contain a number of beneficial ingredients. Many of these ingredients are rich in dietary fiber, which helps to promote digestive regularity and reduce the risk of constipation. These drinks also contain antioxidants and vitamins that can help to protect the digestive system from damage and reduce inflammation. Certain green drinks can also provide probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can help to balance your gut microflora.\\nThis can lead to improved digestion and a stronger immune system. Additionally, some green drinks contain prebiotics, which are food sources for the probiotics. This helps to further promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. Examples of ingredients in green drinks that are beneficial to digestive health include alfalfa, wheatgrass, spirulina, chlorella, and barley grass. These superfoods are packed with minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that can help to improve your digestive health.\\nAdditionally, many green drinks contain ginger and turmeric which have anti-inflammatory properties and can help to improve digestion.\\nGetting the Most Out of Green DrinksGetting the most out of your green drinks is all about understanding the potential health benefits they can offer. To maximize the digestive benefits of green drinks, it is important to know what type of green drink is right for you, as well as how much and how often to consume them. When selecting a green drink, it is important to consider the ingredients and the nutrients they contain. Look for drinks that contain a variety of leafy greens, like kale, spinach, collard greens, and Swiss chard.\\nThese greens are packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals that can help improve digestion. Additionally, look for drinks that contain probiotics to aid in digestion. The amount and frequency of consuming green drinks also plays an important role in getting the most out of them. Drinking green drinks throughout the day can be beneficial for digestion, but it’s important to not overdo it.\\nStart by drinking one cup a day and work up to two or three cups a day if desired. Be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day as well. Finally, it’s important to note that there may be potential risks associated with drinking green drinks, particularly when they are loaded with sugar or artificial sweeteners. It is important to read labels and choose green drinks that are low in added sugar.\\nPreparing Green Drinks SafelyWhen preparing green drinks, it’s important to make sure they are safe for consumption. To do this, start by washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing any green drinks. Additionally, it’s important to make sure all fruits and vegetables used are fresh and properly washed before being blended or juiced. Any food that appears to be spoiled or contaminated should be discarded immediately. When blending or juicing your green drinks, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.\\nIf you are using a high-speed blender, be sure to blend your ingredients on a low setting for a few seconds at a time. This will ensure that the ingredients are evenly blended without creating too much heat, which could potentially reduce the nutritional value of your green drink. When juicing, it’s important to use the correct type of juicer and fresh produce. Be sure to follow the instructions for your particular juicer to ensure that you get the most out of your ingredients and avoid over-juicing or damaging the machine.\\nAdditionally, it’s important to avoid adding any artificial sweeteners or other additives to your green drink, as these can potentially reduce its nutritional value. Finally, it’s important to store any leftover green drinks in an airtight container in the refrigerator. This will help ensure that they stay fresh and retain their nutritional value. Additionally, if you make large batches of green drinks at one time, it is best to store them in small portions and consume them within a few days.\\nTypes of Green DrinksGreen drinks come in a variety of forms, including juices, smoothies, and powders. Green juices are typically made by pressing fruits and vegetables together to extract their liquid, while green smoothies are created by blending the same ingredients together until they reach a smooth consistency.\\nGreen powders are made from dehydrated fruits and vegetables that have been ground into a powder form. Green juices are a great way to get an abundance of vitamins and minerals quickly. They are typically low in calories and easy to digest. Juices also contain all the fiber from the fruits and vegetables, which can help promote digestive health.\\nHowever, they lack the protein and fat found in whole fruits and vegetables, so it’s important to combine juice with other foods for a balanced meal. Green smoothies are a great source of vitamins, minerals, and protein. The blending process breaks down the cell walls of the fruits and vegetables, making them easier to digest. They are also packed with fiber, which can help you feel fuller longer.\\nSmoothies are also a great way to add healthy fats such as nuts or nut butter to your diet. Green powders are an easy way to get your daily dose of vitamins and minerals on the go. They can be added to shakes or smoothies or sprinkled over food. They are usually made from a blend of different fruits and vegetables, providing an array of nutrients in one convenient package.\\nHowever, it’s important to check the label to make sure you’re getting a quality product that is free from added sugars or preservatives. In conclusion, green drinks offer a variety of digestive benefits and can be a great addition to a balanced diet. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with them, such as added sugar or preservatives, as well as to make sure that they are prepared in a safe and healthy way. By researching the different types of green drinks available, understanding the benefits they offer, and preparing them safely, you can ensure you are getting the most out of green drinks for your digestive health.\",\n",
       " 'Due to Andy preparing the review that accompanied today’s album premiere, I found myself with some spare time that I don’t usually have. What to do with that? I thought about continuing to play catch-up on my Most Infectious Song list by putting together a second installment for the day, but decided instead to listen to some new songs for the purpose of compiling a round-up. It didn’t take me long to find some that hooked me, in part because my comrade DGR pointed me to two of them.\\nSHARED TRAUMA (U.S.)\\nI’m beginning with the first of DGR’s suggestions. It’s the debut single from a new band named Shared Trauma, which was formed by former members of The Black Dahlia Murder (Ryan “Bart” Williams) and The Faceless (Derek Rydquist, Michael Sherer, Brandon Griffin), along with drummer John Thomas. The name of the song is “Radiant Prison“.',\n",
       " 'It amazes me how many people think that since I\\'ve made YouTube videos about the religion I was brought up in, which is dominant in my culture going back millenia, and which I threw myself into whole-heartedly as a teenager, and struggled with, and eventually came to face as having been a lie that I\\'d lived like a fucking dupe, that that means that I am OBLIGED now, given the size of my subscriber base, to make videos about a religion about which I know absolutely fuck all and have never ever had any experience of whatsoever. Islam.\\nPeople seem to fail to realise that the strength of my videos about Christianity comes from the fact that I know things about Christianity. A lot. I know a LOT about Christianity. I can pull bible quotes and references out of what would appear to some to be thin air, but which is actually decades of exposure to the religion and its text and theology and apologetics. Perhaps the tiny references and citation gags that I insert into my scripts have gone over the head of many of the people who have enjoyed my videos. Trust me, they\\'re in there. It isn\\'t only my brilliant MS-Paint artwork that has made them so discomfiting for many Christians.\\nMore and more, over the last few years, as Islam has become prominent in the western mind, I\\'ve been getting comment after comment from people who think that I ought to just flick that switch that I apparently have in my mind, download a lifetime\\'s intimate experience of the religion of Islam, and make NonStampCollector videos about that religion, instead; complete, presumably, with the same sort of awareness and familiarity that has given my videos about Christianity their strength.\\nSeriously, in many people\\'s minds, I have a moral obligation to make videos about Islam, and they think that if I have any gaps in my knowledge of Islam, then I have a moral obligation to fill those gaps with research, in my own abundant spare time; the kind of spare time that has allowed me to make, on average, one video per year for the last 4 years, on a topic with which I am already abundantly familiar.\\nSome commenters can get pretty indignant in their demands that I devote the time between work and my family responsibilities to becoming as familiar with Islam as I am with Christianity (which would likely only take several decades, after all), so as to be able to make the videos that I am apparently obliged to make. They DEMAND that I receive the same kind of inspiration, regarding Islam, that have always been the spark of new NSC script ideas. They seem to be demanding that I be walking down the street, pondering some interesting little chestnut of Islamic scripture or lore (as though I\\'m as likely to be doing that as they themselves are), and come up with an analogous satirical parallel involving various characters from the Qaran which will draw on an enormous number of references to all corners of the faith, allow for all sorts of finicky language jokes, and put the Islamic faithful in a self-reflective corner that might disturb their mental status-quo and commence some sort of re-evaluation of the sorts of apologetics that they\\'ve always clung to in mental defense of their faith.\\nTo such commenters, the absence of Islam-related videos on my channel is deemed to be absolute proof that I am indeed an APOLOGIST for Islam. \"You\\'ve made videos about Christianity, but not about Islam? Ah ha! Undeniable proof that you secretly support Islam!\" I have been told on numerous occasions by numerous people that I am not entitled to use the term \"antitheist\" to describe my views on religion, because of this glaring lack of Youtube material. I\\'ll often be called a coward, or more recently, a \"regressive\", for not having developed the means by which I might be able to make my style of videos about a religion about which I know zero details. (That, after all, shows such a fantastic and thorough understanding of what Harris and Nawaz mean by the term \"regressive left\". not.)\\nClose to two years ago, such a comment came in, and I\\'d like to post a version of my response to it, as it has not received an adequate response from the OP, and sums up my usual response. In fact, I may have given you the link to this blog post because I want you to read this as my response to a comment of your own. (Having said that, though, my response is pretty abrasive, and if you haven\\'t been rude to me then please don\\'t take the rudeness of my response hereunder to apply to you. I mean - look at how the guy opened.)\\nMy response went thus:\\nYou said: \"Do something similar about muslims instead you fucking coward.\"\\nIt was a compelling argument that you made, eloquently stated, and I find myself convinced. I\\'m going to do it!\\nHowever, I\\'m going to need a great deal of help, because I know next to nothing about the Islamic faith. I\\'m absolutely incapable of coming up with a snappy 12-minute script filled with references to all corners of their scriptures without your help - in fact beyond the Qaran and the Hadith (whatever that is), neither of which I\\'ve ever read, I really don\\'t know enough to even have an idea for a basis of a well-researched script.\\nSo, I suggest that we do a co-write. You\\'re convinced that I need to MAKE these videos, and you also seem convinced that the necessary preparation will be a piece of cake that requires fuck all in terms of effort and time, so I\\'ll assume you\\'re happy to volunteer to be my research assistant. Working together should be a fun adventure! I\\'m glad to have you on board.\\nPlease get the ball rolling by providing me with a detailed crash course in Islamic beliefs, customs, texts, history, politics, apologetics, and culture that\\'s sufficient for me to be able to start finding little problems out of which to start making up jokes, but short and compelling enough for me to read between all of the other things that I have to do with my time- (keeping in mind that in recent years, between work and family responsibilities, I\\'ve only ever had time to make one or two videos per year. Your report had better be good and concise.)\\nOnce you\\'ve done that, we can start choosing characters. I don\\'t know any Qaranic characters beyond the prophet and his 9-year-old bride. Do you know any others? How many? Do you know anything about their characteristics and history? Family connections? Roles? Anecdotes that can be ridiculed? Again, since you think it will be so easy for ME to do the necessary research, you won\\'t have any problem volunteering to do it your fucking self.\\nAfter that we\\'ll need a scenario into which to couch the action we depict in the script. Should we go contemporaneous, or humorously yank the scenario out of its history and into a completely different context? Give a reason for your decision on this.\\nWe\\'ll need some contradictions and mistakes from the text, in fact I\\'ll need PLENTY to choose from just like I have when it comes to Christianity, so you\\'d better get to work on that, too. And given that a lot of the \"contradictions\" that people do see in the Bible simpy aren\\'t contradictions at all, in my opinion, you\\'ll need to give a for-and-against argument on each one that you include so I can be confident that it won\\'t be swatted down by the first muslim listener who hears it.\\nOh, and by the way. Think of the pains I\\'ve gone to in the past to to make sure there aren\\'t any significant errors of theology or apologetics in my videos. If you go making any mistakes in the research you go doing for this, we\\'re absolutely fucked; you realise that, right? If people who know the religion more than either of us start picking holes in our script or our understanding of the history and traditions we\\'re dealing with, it will all have been for zip fucking squat. You get that, right? This video we\\'re working on needs to be convincing and persuasive to people who have been in the religion for their whole life. An absolute precursor to even having them take any notice of our video is for them to be convinced that we know their religion as well as they do. Otherwise: it is for NOTHING. Your research needs to be 100 percent bullet-proof.\\nBut again, that shouldn\\'t be a problem, right?- you seem to think that I could handle it all on my own, in my spare time, so it ought to be a cinch for you.\\nIf you agree to this, then email me your initial proposal, you fucking coward, and let\\'s get to work.\\nYou stupid, arrogant, ignorant fuck.',\n",

       " 'CharmVerse\\'s Xandra Dozet had the pleasure of chatting with Alejandro of Kokonut Network about bringing agriculture to web3 and using CharmVerse to empower and engage their community. Read on to learn some surprising facts about coconuts and maybe CharmVerse, too!\\nOr you can listen to the entire Twitter Space here.\\nChamVerse: So today I am talking with Alejandro (aka Wasabi), cofounder of Kokonut Network, and we\\'ll be talking about the mission behind this DAO, his role there. And then we\\'ll get into the meat of the discussion and dig into his opinions on CharmVerse.\\nWasabi: Kokonut Network. We are trying to build a bridge between web3 and agriculture through a network of coconut farms. This is why we launched a DAO, so we can coordinate and we can use the DAO to fundraise and for rewards, distributions and governance. That\\'s what we\\'re doing.\\nCharmVerse: And it\\'s an agricultural DAO, correct?\\nWasabi: Yeah, that\\'s what we\\'re working on, connecting the agriculture to web3 by creating a network of coconut farms. we have a first [farm] that is going to host 16,000 coconut trees.\\nCharmVerse: Cool. And when I was digging into the website, I didn\\'t realize how much that specific type of palm tree was used in so many products around the world.\\nWasabi: Yes, it is a very versatile fruit. It is the most useful fruit out there because you can use coconut for pretty much everything. Like, you can use them for the health industry. You can use it for cosmetics, you can use it for food. For example, coconut sugar, coconut milk. You can use it even for cars. Automakers use coconut oil. It\\'s like the coconut hair. They create something like fiber glass with these derivatives from the coconut. So it is very useful. [The coconut] is a circular fruit by default. Sometimes people want to build a circular economy, but a coconut is circular by default because nothing goes to waste. You can use even the shells. You can create plates and spoons and forks with the shells.\"\\nCharmVerse: I love it. And not only that. But also these coconut farms are a refuge for animals, right?\\nWasabi: Yeah. Basically we are preserving and creating new habitats by doing this Kokonut project. Because you can take land that is sitting there collecting dust, doing nothing and you can create these coconut farms. The first cycle of a coconut tree can last up to 20 years, before peak fruit bearing. That means that for up to 20 years at least, you cannot use this land for anything other than coconut farming. So you are creating a habitat for animals, a source of pollen for bees, you know how pollination works and how critical is for everyone to have a bunch of bees running around.\\nCharmVerse: What\\'s your role at Kokonut DAO? I know you said you\\'re a cofounder but what\\'s your day to day over there?\\nWasabi: I handle everything from partnerships to this type of public event. I do pretty much a little bit of everything. That\\'s why my title is Secretary of Kokonut Estate. I have to make sure that everything is going according to the plan....And I\\'m literally the bridge between the landowners, the Kokonut DAO members,... and I\\'m in the center of everything.\\nCharmVerse: How large is the community of Kokonut Network?\\nWasabi: So right now we have 43 DAO members. And the goal for this month is to partner with at least 50 projects from the last Gitcoin solution round. Because we created a lot of new friends and synergies with them, we plan to expand the community in that vertical. We\\'ve been working on a paper called \"How to Regenerate Diversity Using Coconuts.\" So in this case we are going to target organizations that are aligned with us with the same values that want to be basically the founding members of Kokonut DAO. Because right now. the members that are getting shares and the people that are joining the project are basically the founding members. Sometimes people ask about NFTs, blah blah blah, and I tell people all the time, it is up to you to make these types of decisions within Kokonut DAO. DAO members have 99% of voting power. We as core team, we don\\'t even have 1% voting power. So it\\'s like I always tell people, it is up to you to use this natural asset however the community sees fit. That\\'s the point of the DAO, right? It\\'s for the community to come together and take initiative and do what needs to be done.\\nCharmVerse: So you are taking on new members? How would someone become a part of the community?\\nWasabi: They just have to join in the discord. We have the DAO lounge and DAOhaus on the Gnosis Chain. So it is a pretty straightforward process. Like you just have to contribute $20 per share. Each share is going to be always backed by one plant, by one coconut tree forever. Like once this coconut tree stops bearing fruit, we\\'re going to replant the tree. And the same share that you bought, let\\'s say, 20 years ago, is going to be still backed by one coconut tree.\\nCharmVerse: Now I want to get into the dirt and your experience and don\\'t hold back. I want to hear what you have to say about CharmVerse. So how did you first discover CharmVerse?\\nWasabi: I was doing research. I\\'m looking for DAO tooling. Because at first, since the beginning, we just wanted to create Kokonut and give complete power to the community. So we were looking for a tool that allows us to provide access and sort of privacy for the DAO members. So that\\'s how I first found out about CharmVerse.\\nCharmVerse: And why CharmVerse? What made you go that route?\\nWasabi: The list of features. Every tool that I have stumbled upon, they were missing something. Like. Some have the docs, some have the tasks, some have the boards, but none of them have all of the things. Like docs, tasks, boards, bounties, proposals - none of them had them all. At first, I was just talking on the CharmVerse Discord, looking at okay, let\\'s see what\\'s up. Because I consider myself a power user for tools. I love to be trying tools, but I believe I have used every tool out there. Once I saw CharmVerse and the flexibility, I just was waiting on the product to become a little more mature. And that happened, like, one month ago. I saw all of the updates coming together and I was like, okay, I need to migrate and we need to change [now].\\nCharmVerse: I love to hear that. Our team has been working nonstop to ship a lot of great features since the summer. So it\\'s great to hear that. Did you use Notion or do you use Notion? Did you use Notion before?\\nWasabi: Yeah, Literally. I\\'m done with Notion. I love it. But it is for very small teams. Once it got strong, let\\'s say three plus members, you got a lot of headaches. With the permissions, with the monthly plans and everything. You start getting the growing pains once you reach three plus members.\\nCharmVerse: That\\'s good to hear. So how are you currently using the platform?\\nWasabi: Right now I\\'m using the platform for information for the DAO members while we set up the Bounties section. Right now I\\'m updating all of the tasks with the proper properties and assigning tasks to people. Right now I use the platform as an information hub. I have a landing page that\\'s going to be the first page a members see when they go inside and the rest of them is going to be gated to DAO members. And this information hub is going to be available for bounty hunters for and everyone within the community, pretty much, that is already what is listed with some type of role from Discord or using Google. This information page is going to be public, but the rest of the workspace is going to be view and comment only for DAO members and using an NFT batch to provide roles for the team. So we set up a token gate with an NFT. So automatically all of the Kokonut team members going to have a full access to the entire workspace. But for the DAO members, we just provide review and comment only access. They request something because they want to be part of some guild or any team or committee.\\nCharmVerse: You\\'re able to have your own landing page. So it looks like your own personal space, right?\\nWasabi: Customized space, yeah. And the price chart for crypto is very useful for calculating bounties. Having these price charts inside the workspaces is something else.\\nCharmVerse: So let\\'s see. So for Bounties, how are you using this function? What are you paying out for currently?\\nWasabi: We\\'re just paying out the bounty hunters right now. We use the bounty function to pay for tasks that are out of the area of expertise of the core team. For example, we run a bounty for the treasury management research so we can create new vouchers, we can create stable coins based on cocnuts. And this was one of the first bounties that we ran on the platform. And I love the process within the Bounties. It is a bridge and very organized.\\nCharmVerse: And you can do batch payments. Do you ever use that?\\nWasabi: Yeah, No, we haven\\'t because we have the DAOhaus, we don\\'t have Gnosis Safe yet. We\\'re going to be using this later on with custom tokens. We are planning to create a custom token that you can exchange after for shares or for stables. We are planning to play a bit with these bounties and custom tokens.\\nCharmVerse: Fantastic. I look forward to seeing that and hearing more about it. So I think a lot of people, when we talk about DAOs, people get super curious about the governance within DAOs. So how do you create do you use CharmVerse to create proposals?\\nWasabi: Not yet, because like I said, we are DAOhaus, so we can just submit a proposal on chain. But starting next week, we are going to start using the proposal builder that I love so much. The first proposal that we\\'re going to use this for is for the Kokonut DAO constitution. I believe that it is a very important piece for the project and what a better tool to create this constitution than the proposal builder. We want to be able to do so much reviewing and drafting before going to vote. And it\\'s crazy how much overhead we take off the plate.\\nCharmVerse: So other than the proposal builder, what are the future plans and objectives relative to CharmVerse for Kokonut network?\\nWasabi: CharmVerse is going to be like the key to unlock the Kokonut Network, and Kokonut DAO growth as a whole. When you have a web3 enabled workspace, the possibility just becomes limitless because you are basically automatically connected to everything. You can have an NFT launch and you can program this NFT to have access to certain pages within the workspace and you can run new programs and create new mechanics for community participation. So I believe that this migration to CharmVerse is going to be the key to really scale the whole Kokonut mission and the work we\\'re doing because right now we\\'re going to be able to have more contributors, more people helping and shaping the project. So we have big plans for CharmVerse as a hub of operations for our DAO.\\nCharmVerse: Well, we are very happy to be able to facilitate that.',\n",

       " 'By 2020, the Millennials are going to overtake their elders as the largest portion of the workforce. With more than 76 million of them, this generation is made up of those born between 1980 and 2002. And their impact on the workplace is about to be felt.\\nFor many companies in the technology integration space, Millennials are becoming more core to the business. As companies are growing or replacing their workforce, it’s becoming increasingly likely that the individuals they’ll hire will fall into this bucket. As their representation in the workplace is growing, it has been challenging for business owners of different eras to acclimate with the “unique” working style they desire (and require to be happy and productive).\\nWhat are company owners and managers supposed to do with this group? As digital natives, they’re actually quite fitting for tech-focused businesses.\\nHowever they fit into our workplaces, Millennials, Gen Xers, and Baby Boomers need to learn to work together. This is entirely possible. For the best chance of success, try these four tips for better connecting to Millennials in the workplace.\\nMore than 60% of Millennials have already changed jobs at least one time; a staggering 91% don’t foresee themselves in the same position three years from now. Millennials tend to be more interested in building skillsets that drive employability rather than employment.\\nIn the past, it wasn’t uncommon to stay with one career and employer for as long as possible. But this generation is seeking to make regular changes that give them exposure to new opportunities. Employers wanting to combat this must consider regular changes, such as training and job rotation that slows burnout and keeps this group interested in the work they’re doing.\\nOffer Flexible Work\\nAmongst Millennials, just under 90% would prefer to work at a time of their choice as opposed to 9-5. Nearly half of Millennials would take flex time or more vacation over increased pay. This generation is highly motivated by flexibility. For most integrators, there are some positions that don’t fit well with this line of thinking; however, for sales pros, programmers, or financial managers, is it possible to offer a little more schedule flexibility as long as the work gets done?\\nMany companies still subscribe to 9-5 hours, but really have no idea why. Perhaps this is a way to garner better talent without having to pay as much. Perhaps it will even drive loyalty?\\nMore than half of Millennials would rather give up their sense of smell than their iPhone. (Who needs to taste their food?) They are highly connected to their devices, apps, and their social networks. They seek to work with companies that embrace technology like BYOD, and that have an open mind about social media networks. Did you know that 56% of Millennials won’t even work for a company that doesn’t allow employees to utilize social media?\\nIf you really want to get Millennials on your side, then perhaps the most important consideration is helping them see where the business is going. Studies have shown that 95% of Millennials are more motivated to perform when they know where they’re headed.\\nAlso, 80% seek regular, on-the-spot feedback instead of formal (delayed) reviews. That same 80% seeks regular feedback from their managers. In short, Millennials must feel close to the company and their bosses, or they will quickly become disconnected.\\nWhile we may interpret Millennials’ fickle and demanding employment style as entitlement (or even laziness), they truly see work differently. But when they are properly motivated and incentivized, Millennials can become tremendous assets by bringing creativity and solutions that meet the demands of a world being born and raised on technology.\\nHow does your company work to engage Millennial employees? Has it been successful? -Daniel Newman, BroadSuite Consulting',\n",
       " 'Factors Linked to Racial Disparities in Chronic Pain After Injury\\nChronic pain is a top cause of disability in the United States, with the costs of medical care and lost productivity exceeding $500 billion, according to an Institute of Medicine report. Many people who suffer an acute traumatic injury—such as from a car crash or violence—continue to experience pain in the year after injury.October 06, 2023\\nPast research has independently established the existence of racial disparities in injury outcomes and in the severity and treatment of chronic pain but not which factors impact chronic pain after an injury. But a collaborative new study led by Penn Nursing researchers and published in the journal Injury Prevention provides new insights into when and why an injury progresses to chronic pain.\\nThe study enrolled a cohort of 650 adult participants—38% white, 33% Black, and 26% Hispanic—from two Level 1 trauma centers in Pennsylvania and Texas. Researchers collected data from medical records and patient interviews within days of injury, three months after injury, and 12 months postinjury. The researchers also assessed preinjury pain, perceived pain control, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression symptoms, discharge with an opioid prescription and follow-up provider visits.\\nThe study found that among seriously injured adults, racial and ethnicity-based disparities in chronic pain may be most driven by differences in the nature of and health care response to acute injuries. Factors associated with disparities include mechanism of injury, severity of injury, pain in the hospital, and length of hospital stay. As an example of differences in mechanisms of injury, Black participants—who reported the highest chronic pain severity in the year after injury—were more likely to be injured by violence when compared to white and Hispanic participants.\\n“I think that the takeaway, for me, was that you can’t take prevention out of the picture when thinking about intervening on racialized disparities in long-term recovery,” says Sara Jacoby, MPH, MSN, PhD, FAAN, associate professor of nursing and the first author on the study.\\n“The absolute best targeted response is to prevent the injury from happening, and that is our responsibility. Just like we want to do preventative care to prevent a heart attack or stroke, we want to prevent injury from happening,” says senior author Therese Richmond, PhD, RN FAAN, the Andrea B. Laporte Professor of Nursing. She says the second-best targeted response is optimally and equitably treating acute pain during hospitalization.\\nJacoby notes that stereotypes and stigma can play into whether patients are believed about their pain and what treatment they receive. The paper cites recent research showing that minority patients in the U.S. receive less analgesia for acute pain, regardless of condition, when receiving emergency medical care.\\nPreinjury pain did not differ across race and ethnicity, but Black participants had higher pain severity on average relative to white participants three and 12 months after injury. The group of factors most associated with outcome disparities at three and 12 months were those related to acute hospitalization: injury mechanism and severity, pain in the hospital, and length of hospital stay.\\nRichmond says that, while this research is a big step forward, it does not fully explain the disparities, and other factors remain unknown, so there is still more work to be done.\\nThis story was first published in Penn Today. It was written by Erica Moser, science writer in University Communications.',\n",

There are different disciplines of clay target shooting available including Down the Line (DTL), Skeet, ISSF (includes ISSF Trap, ISSF Skeet and ISSF Double Trap), FITASC Sporting and FITASC Compak. Each discipline has a varied approach to the delivery of targets and gives shooters a different experience. Some clubs shoot all disciplines, some specialise in only one of the disciplines. Information on the types of facilities available at each club is listed in the information page under each club. Clay Target Shooting is a sport that can be enjoyed by the whole family as a recreation at a local clay target club, or at a competition level from club events to regional, national and international competitions. These include Oceania Championships, World Championships, Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Age or ability is not a barrier as events are run under a grading system, based on current performance. New shooters begin in C grade and can rise to AA grade. This reflects the shooter's ability and encourages an improvement in performance. There are also category placings for Ladies, Juniors, Veterans and often Super Veterans. The ages for Juniors, Veterans and Super Veterans vary between disciplines due to International Rules. Whatever you want to do, whether it is simply having fun once or twice a month, or aiming to become a National Team member, Clay Target shooting is an exciting, active sport at any level.

DMI recently hosted a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony at its 198,000 square foot facility on S.W. 15th Street. It is estimated that the business will be manufacturing product in the facility in the fourth quarter of this year.\\nThe largest company of its kind in North America and one of the largest in the world, DMI plans to use the Wagoner property for manufacturing all five of its product lines — Ductmate Industries, Aire Technologies, GreenSeam Industries, Linx Industries and CL Ward. Ductmate is the largest HVAC accessories manufacturer in North America.\\nRay Yeager, president and chief executive officer of DMI Companies, was joined by State Sen.

       " 'I’m one of those who believes that what stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Sometimes, that good guy is a police officer, and sometimes, the good guy is a civilian. Leftists claim that the good guys’ contribution is so inconsequential that it doesn’t justify honoring citizens’ Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. New Mexico governor Michelle Grisham certainly agrees with that viewpoint. Leftists look to FBI statistics to support their arguments—so will you be surprised to learn that the FBI’s statistics are wrong? And, as always, that the error works to support leftist ideology and political positions?\\nThe Crime Prevention Research Center (“CPRC”) has done a deep dive into the FBI’s Active Shooting Reports from 2014-2022 and discovered that the reports grossly underestimate the number of times armed civilians have stopped active shootings. The FBI says that civilians stop fewer than 5% of active shooters, while the actual data say that civilians, on average, stopped over 35% of active shooters, with the number going up to 63.5% if you include defensive use of guns outside of “gun-free guns” (which I call “shooting fish in a barrel” zones).\\nThe essay opens by reminding readers of what happened in July 2022 in Greenwood, Indiana. A man opened fire in a shopping mall, killing three. He was stopped when 22-year-old Elisjsha Dicken, a licensed carrier, killed the shooter:\\nWhile Dicken was praised for his courage and skill — squeezing off his first shot 15 seconds after the attack began, from a distance of 40 yards – much of the immediate news coverage drew from FBI-approved statistics to assert that armed citizens almost never stop such attackers: “Rare in U.S. for an active shooter to be stopped by bystander” (Associated Press); “Rampage in Indiana a rare instance of armed civilian ending mass shooting” (Washington Post); and “After Indiana mall shooting, one hero but no lasting solution to gun violence” (New York Times).\\nHowever, honest data show that all those claims that good guys with guns don’t really matter were a case of “lies, damn lies, and Deep State statistics.”\\nIn fact, the FBI has been pretty bad about collecting data from those instances in which good people stepped up and, at great risk to themselves, used their legal firearms to stop someone intent on murdering large numbers of innocent people. Thus, according to the FBI, of the 302 events that the FBI identifies as “active shootings,” armed citizens only stopped 14. (According to the FBI, an “active shooting” occurs in a public area when someone is intent upon killing and does kill multiple people.)\\nAu contraire, says the CPRC:\\nAn analysis by the CPRC identified a total of 440 active shooter incidents during that period and found that an armed citizen stopped 157. A previous report looked at only instances when armed civilians stopped what likely would have been mass public shootings. There were another 27 cases that we didn’t include where armed civilians stopped armed attacks, but the suspect didn’t fire his gun. Those cases are excluded from our calculations, though it could be argued that a civilian also stopped what likely could have been an active shooting event.\\nThe FBI reported that armed citizens thwarted 4.6% of active shooter incidents, while the CPRC found 35.7%.\\nThe problem with the FBI data is twofold: First, the FBI misclassified active shootings five times, whether by failing to acknowledge that it was an active shooting or by misidentifying that civilian’s identity. Second, and more significantly, the FBI missed 103 incidences that comported with its own definition of an “active shooting.”\\nWhat also matters in understanding that the numbers are fundamentally flawed is that they roll together shootings in places where civilians can carry arms and those in which they can’t (those “fish in a barrel” situations):\\nThere is yet another reason that these corrected percentages are biased downward as they ignore that about half of these attacks occur where guns are banned, so law-abiding citizens who obey those rules wouldn’t have a chance to stop them.\\nThe FBI’s active shooting reports do not mention whether the attacks occur in gun-free zones. “The issue is that when places are posted as gun-free zones, law-abiding citizens obey those rules and would be unable to stop the attacks in those areas,” notes Carl Moody, a professor at William & Mary and the CPRC’s research director.\\nThere is much more in the CPRC essay, so I urge you to review it yourself. I just wanted to focus on the top-line information: Once again, an organization that is hostile to a constitutional right manages (coincidentally, I’m sure) to pervert the available data in a way that supports its biases.\\nGuns are an integral part of liberty. A government that is hostile to liberty is also hostile to guns, believing that only the government should control the great equalizer. This was/is the M.O. in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Communist China, Communist Cuba, all of socialist Europe, etc. When only the government has guns, you live in a concentration camp, and that’s true no matter how nice a camp it seems.\\nSource: Andrea Widburg, americanthinker.com/blog/2023/09/the_fbi_massively_erred_about_civilians_stopping_active_shooters.html',\n",

He said he carefully looks at each such case before making a decision. – In addition to objective criteria, I am also guided by my own sense of the matter. I simply read the files very carefully and analyze pardon cases. I examine each one separately and think deeply about each one, he assured.\\nPresident Duda on the Ogórek and Ziemkiewicz case\\n– Please believe me that I carefully analyze each such case. And not once. Usually several times before I decide to exercise the right of grace – towards this or that person. I do this to get to know the matter well and to consider all its aspects.

That is why I use the law of grace much less frequently than my predecessors, he argued.\\nAndrzej Duda referred to the case of Magdalena Ogórek and Rafał Ziemkiewicz, convicted of defamation under Art. 212 of the Penal Code.

Here’s what a Google subscription looks like now.\\nYouTube Premium subscription increases were introduced in the US some time ago, and now Google is also raising prices in Europe. This means that we also have to take into account the more expensive YouTube Premium in Poland. This is how much you have to pay the company now.\\nYouTube Premium more expensive in Poland. The price jumped by a few zlotys\\nSo far, the increase is taking place without much fanfare. However, foreign portals inform about international action concerning Poland, as well as countries such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Chile, Germany and Turkey.\\nThe YouTube Premium increase was to come into force on November 1, 2023. In Poland, the price was PLN 23.99 in July. The official website advertising YouTube Premium already displays the amount of PLN 25.99. The increase is therefore two zlotys.\\nThe company’s communication to subscribers shows that the increase only applies to new users for now. In Australia, emails say this is the “first ever subscription increase” for the country. Additionally, customers currently paying for the service will be able to use the old price “for at least three additional months.” Eventually, however, they will have to come to terms with the higher price.\\nIt is worth recalling that at the same time, YouTube has recently started penalizing the use of ad-blocking software on the platform. The increase in prices and the simultaneous removal of adblocks will most likely cause considerable dissatisfaction among users in a short time.\\nYouTube raises prices in the US\\nLike most internet companies, YouTube is introducing price increases gradually, rolling out more regions one by one. Previously, we wrote at Wprost.pl about the changes that took place in the USA.\\nAt the end of July this year, the price of YouTube Premium in the United States increased by $2, i.e. slightly above PLN 8. Such an increase was more understandable because the service was introduced there already in 2015. In Poland, the value of the increase is lower, but the service was made available in our country only in 2019.\\nWhat does YouTube Premium give you? Users who pay an additional fee can watch content without ads. Additionally, they will play the video in the background or download it to the device’s memory. They also receive better video playback quality – 1080p Premium.',\n",

       " \"Birding is not limited to any particular time of the year or the day. All you need is a lot of patience and a good pair of binoculars. This is something very familiar to birders--sometimes you'll find yourself motionless, on your belly, stuck in one position holding your breath for the fear of chasing away that rare sociable lapwing that have come thousands of miles away from Kazakhstan. You know how important that sighting is when you also know that they are critically endangered. India is a place of choice for many birds from countries far away. On one hand we have these migratory birds and then on the other we have birds so rare and endemic that you'd have to be lucky to spot them. Here are some of those rare birds of India you need to go see before it's too late.\\nGreat Indian Bustard\\nAs of 2018, about 150 of these birds are left in India. Shocking, but it's true for these beautiful birds. Due to the loss of habitat (dry grasslands and shrubs) these birds are facing the danger of extinction. They have only few pockets in India to call their home--Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. What they don't like is an irrigated land and since most of their choice locations have been turned into cultivable land, their number have greatly diminished. They are a rarity no doubt but if you have the patience (and luck), you may find them in semi arid grasslands.\\nAusten's Brown Hornbill\\nIn India, they are found only in the forest of Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh. Outside the country, they are found in southern Vietnam and northern Thailand. Their restricted habitat makes them a rarity and on top of that, the dense woods of Namdapha makes it almost hard to find these birds. But if you are out looking to spot these winged beauties, look for holes left by the great slaty woodpeckers.\\nThough not a resident bird, we are interested in social lapwings because they travel long distance from Russia and Kazakhstan to come to India during winter. Back home they breed on open grasslands. When in India they can be found in north western regions of India--Gujarat, Rajasthan, and parts of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. These birds are critically endangered and the rapid loss of habitat is one of the reasons behind it.\\nSeen those cute and colourful tiny birds in cages Cute little pets, right Wrong Birds do not belong in cages, no matter how adorable they look and how good make your front porch look. Keeping birds as pets have pushed some species of birds to the brink of extinction from where coming back is nothing short of a miracle. One such bird is the green avadavat. These little green and yellow birds with black and white stripes are endemic to Indian subcontinent and their numbers are rapidly declining. Once abundant, now their population is restricted to central India, Rajasthan, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Maharashtra. Away from cages if you want to spot them, agricultural lands are the best.\\nThere are only two breeding regions for these big endangered birds--Assam and Cambodia. They love shallow lakes and garbage dumps and can be mostly seen scavenging around these parts. Assam is the best place where you can spot these birds. Earlier they used to be found in West Bengal but these days, you'd have to be lucky enough to spot them. Look for these birds during winter.\\nOne thing is common for all grassland birds--their habitat is in constant threat. Be it agricultural or developing a land, open grasslands are the first to fall. And because of this reason, Bengal Floricans are now critically endangered. The species is native to Indian subcontinent, Cambodia and Vietnam. Less than a thousand of this species remain in the wild and the numbers are constantly in decline. In India they are found in the Terai regions of Assam, parts of Arunachal Pradesh and grasslands of Uttar Pradesh. It is extremely rare to find these birds because nowadays there are very limited grasslands but come March - August, which is their breeding season, there are chances to spot them.\",\n",

       " 'Interior Signage : A Great Brand Building Tool That Shares Your Products in an Attractive Way\\nWhen people visit an office, it’s a good idea to have wayfinding signs that guide them through the building. This can prevent visitors, customers and employees from getting lost and becoming frustrated in the process.\\nInterior signage for offices is a great brand building tool that helps share your business’ history, products or services in an attractive and professional way. It’s important to have a consistent color scheme and font throughout your marketing and messaging. This will provide the repetition necessary for your brand to take hold.\\nWhether it’s a large office complex or educational facility, wayfinding signage is key for guiding people through your space. It puts visitors and customers at ease and increases their likelihood of becoming regulars.\\nUsing a variety of signs, from directional signs to visual cues and directories, can help you lead visitors to their destinations. A well-planned indoor wayfinding sign package also includes identification signs, warning signs and regulatory signs that set boundaries in your building or facility.\\nA directional sign is a vital form of wayfinding signage because it helps visitors find their destination quickly. Ideally, these are located at every intersection throughout the building or facility.\\nDirectional signs should include clear and simple directions. If they don’t, visitors may get lost and backtrack.\\nLikewise, room identification signs should be clearly marked to make sure even first-time visitors can locate rooms easily. In addition to displaying names and numbers, these signs should indicate where restrooms are located, elevators and other major areas of interest.\\nSafety signage is a vital part of any office building or workplace. It lessens the risk of injuries to employees and non-employees and helps create a safer work environment.\\nDepending on the type of business or facility you operate, you may need different types of safety signs. For example, laboratories typically have chemical, danger, caution and instruction signs, while construction and worksites often require emergency exit and fire fighting equipment signs.\\nThe best sign materials are designed to withstand the rigors of industrial environments and are durable enough to stand up to forklift traffic, chemicals, water and UV rays. They also have a variety of fastening options, such as adhesive or mechanical fasteners.\\nIn addition, OSHA and ANSI standards provide guidelines for the design, placement, shape and choice of warning symbols. These guidelines can be confusing for businesses, but the information provided by these standards is critical to reducing injuries and providing a safer workplace.\\nWhen a customer enters your office building, it’s important that they feel comfortable and welcome. This is easily accomplished with lobby signs that are designed to make people immediately feel at ease.\\nLobby signs can also help visitors and clients know what your business is all about. Many leading companies display slogans, mottos, and even their logo on lobby signs to let people know what they do and who they are.\\nAnother reason why businesses choose to use lobby signs is because they help with wayfinding. These signs can direct customers to restrooms, elevators, and meeting rooms within an office complex.\\nOffice lobby signs are made of a variety of materials, including metal, acrylic, PVC, and foam. The materials you select will depend on the look you are going for, as well as your brand goals and budget.\\nADA signage is necessary to make sure that all customers and visitors have an easy time using your facility. It helps prevent fines, ensures that employees and people in your building have a positive experience, and helps to build a reputation for your business.\\nWhether your business is large or small, ADA signs are an important component of making your establishment accessible to everyone. Adding raised characters and Braille to your signs doesn’t add much to the cost and it makes a big difference for people with blindness, mobility impairments, cognitive disabilities, hearing issues and more.\\nADA regulations also include standards for fonts and spacing that must be followed closely when creating your signs. These include raising characters and fonts, having high contrast between text and background and placing them a certain height and space.',\n",

Taking the experience of 32 caps, including captaining the team when South Africa won the inaugural Cosafa Women’s Cup in 2002, she went on to become the most successful women’s coach in South Africa.\\nAfter a stint as assistant coach to Vera Pauw, Desiree was officially appointed head coach in 2018 and continued adding to her outstanding resumé. A high point came in 2022 when she coached Banyana Banyana to the Wafcon title in Morocco. The win also earned the team automatic qualification for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup.\\nBut Desiree’s inspiring football journey began many years before on the streets of Salt River in Cape Town where she developed the strength and skills that earned her the nickname ‘Magic’ on the field. Back then soccer boots were only dreamed of and it was her Bata Toughees school shoes that suffered the wear and tear, often to the despair of her hardworking parents. In the early days of the Athlone Celtic women’s side, it was a family affair: (Uncle) Eddie took on the role of coach, (Mom) Natalie’s seamstress skills saw them all kitted out, and (Dad) Ernest handled everything else, from transport to scheduling games.\\nWhen Desiree’s talent and dedication saw her become a serious contender at league and then provincial level, and finally gave her a chance to play with and against the world’s best, there was no stopping her.

       " '¶ … Managing All Stakeholders in the Context of a Merger Process\\nReview of the Relevant Literature\\nTypes of Mergers\\nIdentifying All Stakeholders in a Given Business\\nStrategic Market Factors Driving Merger Activity\\nSelection Process for Merger Candidates\\nSummary, Conclusion, and Recommendations\\nThe Challenge of Managing All Stakeholders in the Context of a Merger Process\\nMergers and acquisitions became central features of organizational life in the last part of the 20th century, particularly as organizations seek to establish and maintain competitiveness in an increasingly globalized economy (Nevaer & Deck, 1996). Mergers are generally described as being the formal joining or combining of two corporations or business (Prichett, 1987), although both the framework and the method of merger vary greatly. The reasons for mergers are different based on what a company is trying to accomplish. The acquiring firm may seek to eliminate a competitor; to increase its efficiency; to diversify its products, services, and markets; or to reduce its taxes. Methods used to accomplish mergers may range from friendly to hostile takeovers and may involve varying degrees of company integration (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002).\\nStatement of the Problem\\nAccording to Letza, Kirkbridge and Sun (2004), the current debate and conceptualization concerning corporate governance has been focused on two perspectives: a shareholder perspective and a stakeholder perspective. Although advocates and supporters of each view seek to justify its superiority, rationality and universality, such analysts rarely pay attention to the fundamental conceptions, assumptions and presuppositions that underlie their perspectives which are less credible and valid in matching the continually changing practice of corporate governance.\\nJustification of mergers are primarily based in three interrelated business themes; synergy, shareholder value, and enhanced competitiveness (Robinson & Peterson, 1995). Synergy would suggest that the two entities in combination may create new opportunities and efficiencies in that could not be realized in singular operation. Furthermore, synergy implies that the merging entities may be substantially different from one another in complementary ways. Competitiveness is grounded in the argument that larger organizations are necessary to compete effectively in an increasingly global market. This concept is closely connected to globalization pressures, suggesting that size is a requisite feature of a success in a globalized economy. Finally, synergy and competitiveness, it is argued, will lead to increased shareholder value in terms of higher stock prices.\\nAlmost inevitably, however, mergers create some level of duplication and the need to eliminate some functions and associated jobs. For internal audiences, such as employees, merger is a source of high uncertainty and reduced job security. This level of uncertainty may result in employee stress and, in some cases, active resistance to the change (Fairhurst, Green & Courtright, 1994). When people are threatened, or perceive the potential for a threat, they may resort to a wide range of behaviors that overtly or covertly serve to undermine or sabotage organizational change (Robbins, 2001). This point is reiterated by House (1996), who points out that most people, just being people, are reluctant to any change in their routine. Many people will passionately challenge each and every effort on the part of management to alter any aspect of their duties; however, when this active resistance originates among key managers, there are more fundamental issues involved.\\nFurthermore, such conditions are frequently more pronounced in global mergers through arguments about loss of American jobs. In virtually every case, though, the uncertainty and stress of a merger will result in at least a short-term loss of productivity. This uncertainty is most frequently resolved by providing stakeholders with clear statements of justification, articulation of motivation for the merger, and clear and compelling visions of the future (Ford & Ford, 1995). Clear, frequent, consistent and unambiguous messages, therefore, would be most desirable when facing a potential merger (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002).\\nMoreover, corporate leaders frequently engage in a process of framing, offering world views, perspectives or visions, in order to manage the larger meaning of a merger (Putnam & Fairhurst, 2000). In mergers, these models frequently represent the larger strategic visions of the future that link old structures, cultures and identities with new in persuasive ways. This strategic framing may draw on a number of linguistic and rhetorical devices including catchphrases, jargon, spin and metaphor (Putnam & Fairhurst, 2000, p. 89).\\nPurpose and Importance of Study\\nThe purpose of this study is to identify the key aspects related to managing all of the stakeholders in the context of a merger process. The importance of this study relates to the fundamental issue in any merger, which ultimately...\\nAn effective merger permits the combined organization to achieve synergy and enhanced productivity relatively quickly, with minimum stress and uncertainty for the organizational participants. By sharp contrast, ineffective mergers may result in long-term loss of productivity through alienation of employees and other key stakeholders, turnover of valuable employees, layoffs and lost jobs, and high levels of stress and uncertainty for those who remain. Although a number of pre-merger variables such as the relative health of the individual companies, and the degree of fit influence effectiveness, the strategies of merger, including the surrounding discourse, must also be considered (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002 p. 40).\\nCompanies are a collective means by which people assert their self-interests. To achieve their personal and organizational goals, owners and managers need employees and customers. Employees become involved with companies to assert their self-interest and to satisfy personal, economic, and social goals. Customers assert their self-interests as they select among products and services. In this sense, companies can be discussed \"in terms of a set of organizational problems of different meaning and consequences for different organizational stakeholders. Problems are solved by sets of strategies and activities proceeding from different rationalities proposed by different stakeholder groups\" (Fitzgibbon & Seeger, 2002 p. 6). This approach is also compatible with Putnam and Fairhursts\\' concept of \"organizing as negotiation\" (p. 251).\\nBecause persons and companies all tend to act in ways that affect each other\\'s interests, organizations can be defined as negotiated enactments of stakeholder interests. Emphasizing this point, Mumby (1988) concluded, \"Organizations are not stable, fully integrated structures. Rather, they are the product of various groups with competing goals and interests. An organization services a group\\'s interests to the extent that it is able to produce, maintain, and reproduce those organizational practices that sustain that group\\'s needs\" (p. 166).\\nEssential to this process are the individual decisions to seek, give, and hold stakes in the form of potential rewards or costs. The stakes, though, are negotiable and tend to affect the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. Timely stakeholder analyses provides researchers, managers and, in fact, affected stakeholders themselves, to see how organizational and individual behaviors enact self-interests and affect relationships (Heath, 1998).\\nEach company communicates with many stakeholders. How well it communicates is crucial. In this era of increasing regulatory constraint, managers need to understand how to position their company to take advantage of or remediate the constraints imposed by various stakeholders, whether internal or external. Some companies have become increasingly sensitive to the stakes their workers hold. Workers are able to assert their interests through legal and regulatory actions. They can sue if they believe they have been discriminated against or treated badly. They can \"blow the whistle\" if the company is violating laws, regulations, or contracts. They can leave and join another company (Heath, 1994).\\nPersons outside of organizations assert their self-interests by seeking and granting stakes. Neighbors in the locale of a company\\'s plant may assert their self-interest by complaining about the health hazards it creates. How this self-interest is defined and asserted can impinge on the company\\'s goals and operations. If the plant puts out pollutants that neighbors believe are harmful, they can exercise regulatory and legislative control of those emissions. In this regard, self-interests of neighbors are not simple -- not merely a matter of health, for instance. A plant in a community is a source of jobs -- a way its neighbors assert their self-interest. It can affect the tax base of the community and can be a matter of civic pride (Heath, 1994).\\nOverview of Study\\nThis study employs an action research approach to examine the question of how to best management all stakeholders\\' interests prior to, during and following a merger or acquisition. A review of the relevant and scholarly literature in Chapter 2 is followed by a description of the methodology and study approach in Chapter 3. An analysis of the data is provided by Chapter 4, followed by a summary, conclusion and recommendations in Chapter 5.\\nReview of the Relevant Literature.\\nBackground and Overview. According to Black\\'s Law Dictionary, a merger is \"the fusion or absorption of one thing or right into another; generally spoken of a case where one of the subjects is of less dignity or importance than the other. Here the less important ceases to have an independent existence\" (1991 p. 988). When the merger occurs between two corporations, there is statutory guidance as to which one of the corporations survives and the other disappears. \"The absorption of one company by another,\" Black\\'s adds, \"[with] the former losing its legal identity, and latter retaining its own name…\\nManagement Styles Fool-proofing a service operation.

Which bullet is more likely to knock over the block, or are both equally likely to do so? Justify your choice based on physics principles.\\nAnswer and Explanation:\\nSince we\\'re discussing shots, the significant thing is the way the energy is changed over as there is deceleration of the bullet to a halt when it hits something.\\nKinetic Energy is relative to mass times speed squared, so in reality, the 2 cases given have practically indistinguishable Kinetic energy. The measure of energy is authoritative, so the two cases will do generally a similar harm given, obviously we look at situations when all the kinetic energy is spent.\\nOne contrast that will be effectively obvious is that the weapon in the case of heavy bullet will recoil more.\\nOne can consider energy assimilation as force times separation distance, and energy ingestion as a product of force and time.\\nHenceforth, the heavier yet more slow bullet with a similar energy will venture to every part of a similar separation in the engrossing material, but since of bigger force, will take a more drawn out time doing it.\\nIt will along these lines, additionally, give a more noteworthy \"kick\" to the object that absorbs.\\nYou know that you sound better when you sing in the shower.

       " 'Beginner’s Guide to Rhodes\\nRhodes is the largest of the Dodecanese islands and also the 4th largest Greek Island overall after Crete (#1), Euboea (#2) and Lesbos (#3).\\nThe island is home to more than 42 beautiful beaches, an international airport, stunning landscapes,\\nBut Rhodes, to me, is much more than a historical Greek Island. It’s a place I feel at home when I visit.\\nBelow, you’ll find all of my best recommendations when it comes to things to see, do and experience in Rhodes.\\nBy the end of this article you’ll be able to craft your own journey to this incredible Greek island.\\nBefore You Go: Travel Insurance\\nWhen planning a trip to Greece and the Greek Islands your first priority should be to make sure you make a small investment towards your health and well being by considering an affordable travel insurance policy for your trip.\\nNot only will this budget friendly travel insurance policy cover you if your bags are lost/stolen and if your flight is delayed/cancelled, but you’ll also be covered for all medical and injury related issues as well.\\nLet’s face it. No parents, family or friends want to have to cover the cost of you getting medevaced home from Greece.\\nUnfortunate things do happen.\\nEspecially when you least expect it.\\nDo yourself a favor and consider purchasing travel insurance coverage for your trip so you can rest assured that you’ll be taken care of in the event of a serious emergency in Greece.\\nP.S. You won’t believe how reasonably priced this travel insurance is.\\nHow to Get to Rhodes\\nFlights to Rhodes:\\nFlights to Rhodes are plentiful and can sometimes be cheaper than renting a car in many cities across the globe. No, seriously!\\nOne of the reasons why I booked my second trip to Rhodes in July was due to the fact that I stumbled upon an insanely cheap round-trip flight from Athens to Rhodes for just 46 Euro (approx. $50 USD).\\nYes, that’s right. $50 for a round-trip flight. To put things into perspective, a ferry from Athens to Rhodes costs 51 Euro each way and it takes nearly 16 times longer to get there (16 hrs).\\nFlight from Athens to Rhodes: 50 minutes.\\nFerry from Athens to Rhodes: 16 hours.\\nWhen it comes to finding cheap flights to Rhodes, your best bet is to use a combination of Skyscanner & Google Flights to compare prices, check the flexible date calendars and ultimately find out which dates and fares work best for you.\\nTip: Begin your flight search by using the Skyscanner engine embedded below.\\nFerry to Rhodes:\\nYou can also reach Rhodes by ferry if you prefer traveling by boat.\\nJust remember that you will need to factor in that the ferry takes 16 times longer than a flight and is generally more expensive than flying.\\nAll I’m saying here is that I advise you to exhaust all searches for flights to Rhodes before deciding to choose the ferry as your primary mode of transportation.\\nWhen searching for ferries to Rhodes, your best bet is to use Ferries in Greece, a major greek ferry booking hub that helps more than 35,000 passengers get to and from the Greek isles each year.\\nCheck Ferry Schedules & Prices:\\nWhere to Stay in Rhodes\\nI’ve spent time in four different Airbnb apartments in Old Town Rhodes during my two visits but instead of going into detail about all four, I’ll share my thoughts on my favorite apartment of the three.\\nPlease note that all four apartments that I stayed in were owned/managed by the same Airbnb host and two of the apartments were identical to each other just on different floors.\\nNote: You can find some budget accommodation options in Rhodes in my guide to Visiting the Greek Islands on a Budget.\\nThe 3 Charities Euphrosyne apartment is a simple 1-bedroom/1 bath apartment located on the eastern edge of Old Town Rhodes.\\nIt had all the amenities I could ask for including A/C, two burner stovetop, cable TV, Wi-Fi\\nWhen it comes to location, the 3 Charities Euphrosyne apartment can’t be beat.\\nIt’s tucked inside the castle walls of Old Town just steps from Lagani’s and Nimmos Traditional Restaurant, a 5 minute walk to the tourist ferry pier and a 15 minute walk from the Mandraki Marina.\\nOverall I highly recommend this apartment to those of you who are planning on traveling to Rhodes in the near future.\\nIf you try to book the 3 Charities apartment and it’s reserved, be sure to see if my second favorite apartment in Rhodes has availability.\\n🔎 If this is your first time using Airbnb, we recommend you read our Insider’s Guide to Saving Money on Airbnb Apartments.\\nRhodes Airbnb Apartments\\nCozy Loft – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\\nTraditional Greek House – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\\nAzure Suite – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\\nCentral Bath – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\\nLuxury Apartment – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\\nBeach Front Loft – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\\nCenter Penthouse – 1 Bed / 1 Bath\\n30 Rd Villa – 3 Bed / 2 Bath\\nHotels in Rhodes\\n- Semiramis Hotel Rhodes ( Hotels Combined / Booking.com )\\n- Best Western Plus Hotel Plaza Rhodes ( Hotels Combined / Booking.com)\\n- Spirit Of The Knights Boutique Hotel ( Hotels Combined / Booking.com)\\nHow to Get Around Rhodes\\nAirport taxis are plentiful and easy to find considering the Rhodes airport is quite small.\\nAll you need to do is exit baggage and customs and head straight for the doors. Once outside you’ll see a big line of navy blue taxis ahead of you.\\nHead to the front of the line and tell the driver your destination.\\nIf you’re headed to Old Town (like I was), you should know that a taxi from the Airport to Old Town Rhodes cost a flat fee of 22 Euros so there’s no need to haggle your way into town once you land in Rhodes.\\nThe 20-25km (12-15 mile) ride takes about 30 minutes and the first half of the journey brings you along the coastline where you’ll get a sneak peek at some of the beautiful beaches that run along the coast of Rhodes.\\nNote: Taxis from the airport to other parts of Rhodes are all flat fees. There should be a sign outside next to where the taxis line up.\\nGeneral taxi rides (not to/from the airport) can be quite expensive depending on your destination.\\nIt’s usually a lot more affordable to rent a car or motorbike for the day/week instead of having to rely on expensive taxi fares.\\nBeware: There are known scams that involve switching out bills quickly once a passenger pays.\\nMy best advice for this type of situation is to say the bill out loud when you’re paying the driver.\\nExample: Here’s 50 Euros. This way the driver knows that you acknowledge how much you’re paying and you know what you’re handing him/her. Don’t afraid to be verbal and if you do find yourself in a situation where you’ve been scammed, contact the nearest police officer.\\nIf there’s none around you, be sure to let the driver know that you will call the police (even if you have no means to call them). The phone number for the Rhodes Police (from mobile): +30 2241 0 27423-23329\\nBy Rental Car or Motorbike:\\nThe best way to explore Rhodes is by car or by motorbike.\\nCars can be rented for around 40 Euros/day while scooters can be rented for as low as 15-18 Euros/day.\\nMore powerful scooters can cost around 30 Euros/day and are well worth it if you’re traveling with a passenger as they’re a lot more comfortable.\\n- Recommended Motorbike Rentals: Thomas Rentals located across the road from Nimmos Traditional Restaurant in Old Town Rhodes.\\n- Recommended Rental Car Agency: Any of the agencies in the plaza directly across from the Rhodes Tourist Ferry Port. See the map at the bottom of this post for more information.\\nTip: Before returning your car or motorbike, don’t forget to fill the gas tank to the same level as when you received it. Otherwise you’ll end up being overcharged for fuel due to your mistake.\\nMany people rent bicycles to explore Old Town and even destinations outside of Old Town such as Faliraki.\\nI personally wouldn’t recommend renting bicycles in Rhodes.\\nNot only is it burning hot during the summer but the roads are main roads from Old Town to Faliraki they really aren’t built to accommodate cyclists.\\nNot to mention that there are some hills involved that you’ll need to push your bike up and take one look at the aggressive driving of the Greeks and you might quickly change your mind about renting bicycles in Rhodes.\\nIf you’re wanting to cruise around Old Town and visit some beaches in Rhodes town then I recommend renting bicycles.\\nOtherwise, don’t bother. It’s not worth the hassle or your life.\\nExploring Old Town Rhodes\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Medieval Old Town of Rhodes is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\nUnfortunately, as those of you who have been following along with me over the years know, I’m not really into history so I can’t pretend to know much about the island, historically speaking. Sorry!\\nWhat I can tell you are some of my favorite spots in Old Town Rhodes.\\nRecommended Restaurants in Old Town Rhodes:\\n- Hermes – One of the most affordable restaurants in Old Town run by a very friendly man named Hermes.\\n- Not too many tables here so be sure to arrive early if you’re planning on having dinner here. Food is delicious, portions are huge and the prices are as cheap as it gets. The chicken souvlaki plate is to die for. Oh, and you can get giant beers for just 2 Euro. Great place to start your evening before heading out to the bars.\\n- Odyssey Restaurant – This place offers up delicious traditional Greek dishes. This restaurant is a must if you’re looking for traditional Greek food and the prices are very reasonable considering they’re located in a touristy part of town. Try the Giouvetsi and sip your free shot of Ouzo at the end of your meal. Located in the center of Old Town.\\n- Nimmos Traditional Restaurant – Great traditional Greek food and seafood. Good prices, decent portions and friendly service. Easy walk if you’re in Old Town.\\n- Saffron – This restaurant is not located in Old Town but I had to mention it anyway because it was one of my best meals in Rhodes. Saffron is an Indian restaurant located in Rhodes town (not Old Town but close enough to walk) and they offer up some of the most delicious Indian food I’ve had to date. Saffron is one of the highest rated restaurants in Rhodes according to TripAdvisor and rightfully so. I had the Butter Chicken w/ Saffron rice with naan bread and it blew my damn mind. If you’re staying in Old Town you could make the 20-25 minute walk or take a taxi for approximately 5 Euro.\\nThings to See and Do in Old Town Rhodes:\\n- Explore the Medieval City – Old Town Rhodes is known to be one of the best preserved and most extensive medieval towns in all of Europe. Take advantage of this by exploring all of its little nooks and crannies. Walk around the outside of the castle walls, wander the maze of alleyways, visit the monuments and museums and stroll down the avenue of the Knights.\\n- Romantic After Dinner Spot – Take your significant other out to the jetty along the castle wall that faces the tourist harbor and grab yourself a seat on the bench facing the sea. Note: This spot is pretty hidden but you can find the location easily if you follow the point on my custom map at the end of this post.\\n- Pili Agiou Pavlou – Visit this spot to snap some really unique photos while looking through the old castle walls that face out towards the sea. See the map at the end of this post for the exact location.\\n- Treat yourself to a gelato – Grab a 1 Euro cone at the gelato stand on the edge of Mandraki Harbor.\\n- Fresh Catch – Watch the fishermen catch fish at sunset and take photos of the boats entering Mandraki harbor.\\nLindos is both a town and archaeological site located approximately 58 km (36 mi) south of Old Town Rhodes.\\nGetting to Lindos – Lindos is easily accessible by car and motorbike although if it’s blazing hot out and you have the extra money to burn, go for the rental car option over the bike. Trust me, I’ve done the ride to Lindos on both a motorbike and a car and the car was much more comfortable and a hell of a lot less exhausting. That being said, I would definitely take a motorbike there again if it wasn’t the peak of summer. A taxi from Rhodes to Lindos is pretty much out of the question as it would cost a fortune.\\nThe Acropolis – The Acropolis that sits high above the town of Lindos is absolutely amazing and is a must see if you’re looking for some of the best views in all of Rhodes. One thing I should mention is that the climb up to the acropolis requires you to be somewhat active and able to climb stairs, lots of them. The trail begins through town and slowly but surely starts to get steeper as you climb the hill towards the acropolis. Once there, you’re rewarded with historical buildings dating back to 300 BC. More information on the Lindos Acropolis can be found here.\\nSt. Pauls Bay – The beautiful bay seen in the photo above is known as St. Paul’s Bay and it’s even more incredible in person than it is in this photo. Don’t forget your camera!\\nBest Beaches in Rhodes\\nIf you’re interested in spending some time soaking up the rays at the best beaches in Rhodes, you’re going to have quite a tough time choosing between all the beautiful beaches as just about every beach in Rhodes has different characteristics and each one seems to be more amazing than the next.\\nThis video below features 29 of the best beaches in Rhodes.\\nAnthony Quinn’s Bay – (Photo shown above) Anthony Quinn’s bay is one of the most beautiful bays I’ve ever witnessed with my own eyes. The bay is located 17km (10 mi) south of Old Town Rhodes and offers some incredible photo opportunities to say the least.\\nThe beach at Anthony Quinn’s bay is one of the best beaches in Rhodes (IMO).\\nGet there early if you want to snag a sun chair and umbrella and enjoy wading around the bright blue and green water. Amazing!\\nFor the best views of Anthony Quinn’s Bay from above, head on up to the windy road that leads up the hill just north of the bay and you’ll find a spot where you can sit and enjoy the virtually 180 degree views of Rhodes and its coastline.\\nThis is hands down one of my favorite spots in all of Rhodes.\\nAfter a long day of driving my motorbike in the blazing hot sun, I stood at the edge of the cliff with Anthony Quinn’s bay beneath me and I cracked open a can of Cayman Jack.\\nIt was so relaxing and refreshing to kick back and sip on a margarita with views like this surrounding you.\\nTsambika Beach (or Tsampika) – (Photo shown above) Tsampika beach is located 30km (18 mi) south of Old Town Rhodes and is a great place to spend the day in the sun.\\nNote: There is a small section where nudists congregate on Tsampika beach. For the best views of Tsampika Beach, head on up to the Panagia Tsampika Psili Dimou Archagkelou, another one of my favorite spots to take photos in Rhodes.\\nRhodes Beach – This is your standard beach located on the north western tip of Rhodes, just a few steps from the infamous “Bar Street”. I honestly don’t even know the name of this beach so I’m naming it Rhodes beach.\\nLakido Beach – Just opposite Anthony Quinn’s Bay is Lakido beach. It’s literally 3 minutes walking distance from Anthony Quinn’s bay so visiting both beaches in a day is totally doable. As a matter of fact, I would highly recommend visiting both if you get the chance.\\nFaliraki Beach – I did not personally visit this beach but thought I should mention it considering it’s one of the most popular tourist spots on the island of Rhodes. I’m not sure why people stay here but I assume it’s due to the fact that most tourists that stay in Faliraki are there on a sun holiday (aka package holiday) which includes your flights, hotels, and sometimes even food at deeply discounted rates. In my opinion, Faliraki is way too far away from Old Town. Again, I’m only mentioning it because it’s a popular beach destination but do your homework before deciding to stay here. Oh and I should also mention that I stopped by the beach briefly and I have to say there are a lot better beaches on Rhodes.\\nWell, I hope you guys found this post helpful.

If I had to do that every time my ex did something stupid I would be making a statement every day.\\nHowever, public outcry for Kim to say something amassed in the days after West’s anti-Semitic tweets and statements. Boy George of all people was one of the main celebs encouraging Kim to say something.\\n“I’m appalled that Kim Kardashian hasn’t come out and added her voice to this debate,” George wrote on his Instagram.\\n“This woman has children with Kanye, so she must understand as a mother what it feels like for little Jewish children to hear these fucking comments, how demoralising and terrifying it must be.”\\nIn case you missed it, Twitter locked West’s account on October 9 after removing an anti-Semitic tweet that said he was going “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.”\\nTwitter released a statement, saying the decision to bar him from posting is because his tweet violated the platform’s policies against hate speech.\\n“The account in question has been locked due to a violation of Twitter’s policies,” a spokesperson for the platform told BuzzFeed News.\\nWest was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years ago and has been open about his struggle with mental health challenges.',\n",

       " 'The majority of employers support an increase in the statutory minimum wage – as long as it is accompanied by additional support for skills investment, a survey has found.\\nThe poll of more than 1,000 businesses by the Learning and Work Institute and the Carnegie UK Trust – conducted at the start of the coronavirus outbreak – found 54 per cent supported the government’s policy of increasing the national living wage (NLW) to two-thirds of the median income by 2024, which is currently estimated to be £10.50 an hour. Just 9 per cent opposed the move.\\nThe report – The Future of the Minimum Wage: the Employer Perspective – found the majority of employers did not think the increase would have a negative impact on either their business or UK employment more broadly, with 54 per cent saying a higher minimum wage could help boost UK productivity.\\n- Government pledges further hike to national living wage\\n- Low-paid workers bearing the brunt of Covid fall in employment, study finds\\n- Why are so many employers failing to pay the minimum wages?\\nCurrently the living wage – the statutory minimum wage for those over the age of 25 – is £8.72 an hour. The national minimum wage for those aged between 21 and 24 is £8.20 an hour, dropping to £6.45 for those aged 18 to 20, and £4.55 for those under the age of 18.\\nGerwyn Davies, public policy adviser at the CIPD, said it was particularly important to listen to the views of the low-paid sectors, including hospitality and retail, given they are likely to be disproportionately affected by any minimum wage increase: “The report is right to say that the NLW has had a modest negative impact on employment levels to date overall, although there have been some job losses in some low-wage sectors.”\\nDavies also cautioned about linking minimum wage increases to higher productivity: “Some employers from affected sectors are reporting to us that the latest [national living wage] increases have led to cuts in skills investment and had a negative impact on career progression.”\\nGet more HR and employment law news like this delivered straight to your inbox every day – sign up to People Management’s PM Daily newsletter\\n“We also know that work intensification has been the main productivity response to recent rises, which is not sustainable, especially in the current climate,” Davies said, adding that it would be sensible for the Low Pay Commission (LPC), which advises the government on the statutory minimum wage, to increase the minimum wage in line with inflation “to help ease the wage bill pressure on struggling sectors”.\\n“If ever there was a time for the LPC to apply the emergency brake, it is now,” he said.\\nDouglas White, head of advocacy at the Carnegie UK Trust, said it was encouraging that the majority of employers supported a higher minimum wage: “Even before the onset of the pandemic, there were too many workers struggling on low pay.\\n“The economic challenges caused by Covid-19 mean it is even more important that future decisions around the minimum wage are ambitious in delivering better pay for low-paid workers, while recognising the real challenges that many businesses are experiencing and providing them with essential support,” said White.\\nThe report also found that half (50 per cent) of businesses felt they would not need to make any changes in response to the additional cost of a higher minimum wage.\\nA fifth (22 per cent) said they would pass the cost on to consumers; 15 per cent would hire fewer members of staff; and 10 per cent would increase the use of temporary or flexible contracts with the same proportion saying they would reduce staff benefits.\\nHowever, the majority of employers said government support would be necessary to help manage an increase in the minimum wage. More than a third (37 per cent) of employers said they would welcome help investing in skills and training, while a third (33 per cent) said they would like to see any living wage increase to be accompanied by a temporary reduction in national insurance contributions.',\n",
       " 'What to Expect When Closing on a House\\nWhat to Expect When Closing on a HouseJune 30, 2020\\nCongratulations, you are closing on your new home this week! While closing on a house may be the last chapter in your home buying journey, it is important to take time to make sure everything is in place to ensure a smooth, trouble-free closing process.\\nHow long does closing on a house take exactly? The closing process itself is officially completed in one day. However, several steps must be taken between the day your offer is accepted and the day you are officially a homeowner. Read on to learn what to expect the week of closing so that the process runs smoothly.\\nMake Sure Your Closing Contingencies Are Complete\\nAt this point, you should have completed all major tasks and prepared for closing contingencies—after all, these need to be taken care of for the contract to become legally binding. This includes a full home inspection, an appraisal and a final walkthrough. You will also need to finalize your insurance and loan documents.\\nTypically, the final walkthrough will take place within 24 hours of your closing date. Bring your contract to the final walkthrough to make sure the current state of the home exactly matches the originally agreedupon state.\\nDuring the walkthrough, be sure to test and double-check everything. If you see any last-minute damages, your bank may not approve your loan until those are taken care of. You could also ask the seller for a credit if the damages cannot be settled before closing.\\nHave Your Financials in Order\\nOnce you receive your closing disclosure, you will typically have three days to review everything before you sign your final closing paperwork. This form provides final details about the mortgage loan you have chosen and your closing costs. Review each cost very carefully—this will also give you an idea of how much you can expect to pay during closing.\\nNote that you probably will not know the exact amount you will be paying until you are actually in the process of closing on your house. It is good to budget a large buffer and bring your personal checkbook in case any unexpected costs come up.\\nMake sure everything is in place to ensure a smooth processing of your down payment. If there is any chance your bank may delay the payment, bring your down payment to closing in the form of a cashier’s or certified check.\\nAccording to Realtor Mag, about 46% of delays experienced when closing on a house are caused by financing issues. The most common issue? Buyers taking on too much credit before their closing date. This is why it is extremely important to avoid making any large purchases in the days prior to closing on your house. Your lender will also do last-minute credit checks, so significant changes can put your loan at stake.\\nLastly, be sure to have all your documentation to make sure the final approval on your loan is successful. Make a checklist of all the documents you will need, including:\\n- Income statements (pay stubs, W2 forms)\\n- Asset statements (bank accounts, investments)\\n- Insurance information\\n- Copy of contract\\n- Divorce decree, child support/alimony information, bankruptcy papers (if applicable)\\nPreparing for Closing Day\\nYou have officially made it to closing day! There are only a few more steps you need to take until your new home is ready for move-in.\\nWhat to Bring\\nYour title company representative and mortgage loan officer should provide you with a detailed checklist of everything you will need to bring to closing. Here are a few essential items you do not want to forget:\\n- Any outstanding documents/paperwork for the title company or mortgage loan officer.\\n- Your certified or cashier’s check made payable to the title or closing company.\\n- Your personal checkbook, in case any last-minute changes or items that are not included in the settlement come up.\\n- Home inspection reports.\\n- Bidding negotiations and all documents related to the asking price.\\nWhat Happens at Closing\\nClosing on a house is a long and detailed process, so be prepared to spend as long as a couple of hours completing the process. You will need to sign at least 50 to 100 pages of documentation. While it might be tempting to skim through them, it is important to carefully read through each page, as these are binding legal agreements.\\nThe people involved in your appointment may vary, and oftentimes sellers take care of their paperwork separately ahead of time, but you should expect most of the following people to be present at closing:\\n- The escrow/closing agent\\n- The attorney\\n- A title company representative\\n- A mortgage lender\\n- Real estate agents\\nAfter you pay your remaining closing costs and review the seller’s signed property transfer documents (if they’re not present at closing), you will sign a settlement statement, mortgage note (legally stating your promise to repay the loan) and mortgage or deed of trust. The title company will then register the new deed in your name.\\nThe process of closing on your home is not a lightning-fast process, but each little signature is all worth it when you are able to step into your new home!\\nClosing on a house means that you are one step closer to home ownership.

       " \"A resolution introduced to City Council today would forgive up to $115 million in medical debt for up to 24,000 Pittsburghers.\\nPittsburgh City Councilmember Bobby Wilson introduced the bill, which would have the city partner with national nonprofit RIP Medical Debt to purchase and discharge eligible healthcare debt. The organization has determined that 24,000 Pittsburghers meet the criteria for debt relief under the terms of the bill, which requires recipients have accrued at least some of their debt since the onset of the pandemic.\\n“Healthcare debt [is] the most common form of debt on consumer credit reports and is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United States of America,” Wilson said in a press conference this morning, “However, healthcare debt differs from every other type of consumer debt in that people do not plan to get sick or hurt, and when they do get sick or hurt, getting healthcare is not just necessary, but may well be a matter of life and death.”\\nAccording to RIPMD’s website, the organization “buy[s] debt in bundles, millions of dollars at a time at a fraction of the original cost” and forgives the debt with “no tax consequences or penalties to consider” if the debtor makes less than four times the federal poverty line for their household size or has medical debt that exceeds five percent of their income.\\nThe proposed effort would be funded by $1 million of the city’s American Rescue Plan Act allocation. Pittsburgh has received $335 million in total through this federal COVID-19 relief funding allocation.\\nWilson argues the plan would bring outsized benefits in proportion to its cost.\\n“Providing debt relief to Pittsburghers at this scale, where $1 can discharge up to $115 of burdensome medical debt, is just plain common sense,” Wilson adds.\\nMohammed Burny, Wilson’s chief of staff, tells Pittsburgh City Paper the resolution is patterned after successful initiatives in Toledo, Ohio and Cook County, Illinois that used ARPA funds to discharge medical debt.\\nBased on the scale of those projects, Burny says, “We were planning on allocating a significantly larger sum of money,” but were pleasantly surprised to find fewer debtors under the RIPMD income cap than they expected.\\n“We actually think, per capita, we’re better off than most Rust Belt cities,” in terms of outstanding medical debt, Burny says.\\nPrevious local debt relief initiatives may have contributed have contributed to Pittsburgh's reduced rates of medical debt.\\n“Since 2019, there have been multiple philanthropic initiatives in Western Pa.” to eliminate medical debt, Burny says, organized by churches and nonprofit organizations.\\nAccording to February 2022 data compiled by the Urban Institute, seven percent of all households in Allegheny County have medical debt that has been referred to collections.\\n“Anyone is just one medical emergency away from becoming homeless,” assays Councilwoman Erika Strassburger, who is a co-sponsor of the legislation. “The bills pile up and it becomes untenable.”\\nWilson says the resolution is also co-sponsored by Councilmembers Daniel Lavelle, Ricky Burgess, Anthony Coghill, and Barb Warwick. It has been referred to the Committee on Finance and Law.\",\n",
       " \"The following articles are old newpaper accounts of paranormal activity.

Austin. Suddenly O'Hara gave a blood-curdling yell, and his face blanched as he saw rising from the center of the oat field a strange apparition. It was apparently the figure of a man clothed entirely in white. The ghostly figure stalked across the oat field, swinging a lantern in its hand. It advanced to the fence facing the road, and after flourishing his lantern up and down several times like a brakeman signaling a railroad train, the white figure gave a tremendous bound into the air and vanished from sight.\\nThe youth managed to gain strength enough to crawl back into bed. The next morning he told the story of the specter to his parents, who in turn told it to the neighbors, and the neighbors gave it to the local newspapers, and the news was heralded far and wide. The next evening 500 or more people congregated in the highway in front of the O'Hara residence and waited for the apparition to appear. The board fence in front of the oat field was lined with spectators.\\nAbout 10 o'clock the ghost appeared, carrying his lantern with him. The specter made its appearance, apparently rising from the ground at the foot of a beech tree which stands at the west end of the field. The white-robed figure dodged in and out, seen at one minute, the next lost to sight. After continuing this performance for a few minutes, the figure advanced boldly toward the astounded spectators.\\nIt came on with a bounding movement, similar to that made by a kangaroo while in motion. When within a few feet of the spectators, the ghost stood motionless for a second, and after waving the lantern in the air three or four times, suddenly vanished from sight. This is the way a young man of unquestioned veracity tells it.\\nAn Attempt to Capture\\nThe next night an attempt was made to capture his ghostship. Thirteen (an unlucky number) of Auburn's bravest young men took up their position among the branches of the beech tree, from under which the ghost appears. The young sentinels were not afraid of ghosts. Oh, no! and they chuckled to themselves, thinking of what fun they would have in the capture.\\nAbout 300 or 400 people stood in the street. The ghost appeared about 10 o'clock. It arose as usual from the ground at the foot of the beech tree. Its appearance caused an unusual commotion among the brave young men in the tree. One of the would-be captors fainted, while his companions clutched more tightly the branches of the tree and with awe-stricken faces waited for the thing to pass on. His ghostship did not carry his lantern on this occasion.\\nThe following night another and more determined party of men attempted to capture the ghostly visitant. They chased it around the oat field, but could not capture it. Just as one of the pursuers would attempt to place a hand upon the spectre it would suddenly vanish, only to reappear again a second later in a distant part of the field.\\nIt is a motley crowd which gathers nightly to catch a glimpse of his ghostship. Some times it appears and then again it doesn't. It is a very uncertain ghost to gamble on. Old, gray-haired men, as well as barefooted, rosy-cheeked children, gather in front of the oat field and keep nightly vigils, waiting for the apparition to appear. Young men and their sweethearts make the scene a trysting place, and they come on foot and on bicycles to wait and watch. Parents even bring their children out to see the ghost. The fences on both sides of the street have been torn down by the mob, and the oat field is stamped down, as if a herd of Western steers had passed over it. It has been roughly estimated that fully 4,000 people have visited the field during the week.\\nThe scene where the alleged ghost appears is inside the city limits, yet the authorities have taken no action in regard to the matter. Chief of Police MacMaster is waiting for the property owners of that section to enter complaint. There are no city ordinances which prohibit orderly and respectable ghosts from taking up their abode in an oat field or anywhere else.\\nNo Ordinance Against Ghosts\\nIn fact the framers of the city's by-laws neglected to enact ordinances under which a ghost could be apprehended and punished for his temerity in stalking abroad at night with a lantern in its hand. There are many theories as to the identity of the ghostly phenomenon. Some claim that it is the spirit of a restless bicycle rider who was electrocuted during the dark ages for not having his lamp lighted after sundown. That during the revival of the bicycle craze in modern times he is doomed for a certain number of nights to appear with his lantern as a warning to those wicked riders who will persist in letting their lamps blow out on dark and stormy nights. Some say that it is the spirit of a man who was murdered in the oat field many years ago. The criminal records of the county fail to show when the alleged murder was committed, or who was the victim, consequently that story will not hold.\\nA man named Murphy, residing in State street in the vicinity of the haunted field, says that the specter is the Murphy family's cat. Thomas is a beautiful white feline, who occasionally rambles away from home to meet his enamorita in the haunted field.\\nThe theory, however, is not credited by those who have seen the specter, which has been described to be from six to ten feet tall. As Murphy's cat never was, or never will be, ten feet in height the probabilities are that Thomas is not the guilty party.\\nThe O'Haras don't know who or what it is, and what's more, don't like to talk about the matter for publication. One of the neighbors said that the specter is a young girl who resides in York street. The young girl in question indignantly denies the accusation and says that if she ever catches her accuser face to face she will scratch his eyes out. This at once establishes her innocence. Officer Titus, who patrols the State street beat, says that the ghost is a man with a white sheet over his head. Officer Titus started out to investigate the matter a few days ago and to find out if possible who the joker might be. In less than forty-eight hours he was told by as many as fifty of the residents who the guilty party was. Strange to say, every one of the fifty informers were in turn accused by each other of the heinous offense and here the matter rests.\\nThe specter appeared again about 11:15 o'clock to-night and nearly frightened the wits out of a large number of spectators by its grotesque actions. The figure apparently dropped from the clouds into the midst of a crowd of young men, who were seated under the beech tree smoking cigarettes. The smokers dropped their cigarettes and with a screech fled from the field with the strange apparition in hot pursuit. The phantom chased the men into the middle of the street, and then, with a peculiar bounding gait, returned to the field and then vanished from sight.\\nJersey Town Sees Ghost\\nWeird Apparition Keeps Nervous Residents Home at Night\\nThe Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana - 19 March 1911\\nBEVERLY, N.J. March 18 – Bridgeboro, the home of witchlore and ghost scares, had another sensation, which the residents take seriously, and after each nightfall the streets are deserted. Joe Johnson and a party of friends, passing what is known as the Paxson Pits a few nights ago, were confronted by a dwarf which they declared climbed out of a pit. For a minute it lingered and then, giving a piercing screech, vanished into the woods. Other witnesses, farmers of unquestionable veracity, substantiate Johnson’s story.\\nThe old residents say that years ago a reserved man, who lived on the outskirts of the village, and whose name never was learned, as the family would not mingle with the villagers, had a deformed son. The man was driving along the country road, when the carriage was supposed to have overturned and the child fell into the pit and broke his neck. The version of the accident was accepted, but wild rumors were afloat at the time. Those who have seen the specter describe it as a boy whose head seems to hang limp upon his chest.\\nChoked By A Ghost\\nPennsylvania Woman Believes Her Dead Husband Visits Her\\nLogansport Pharos, Logansport, Indiana - 19 March 1901\\nCarbondale, Pa. March 19 - The ghost of John Kinnie has visited his wife’s bedroom twice within a week, and she fears it may be the cause of her death. Each time the phantom visitor choked her, and her neck is said to have black and blue marks caused by long thin fingers. Kinnie died a year ago.\\nJust as the clock tolled midnight last Monday, Mrs. Kinnie says, she heard the front door open. Then there were footsteps in the hall. She hastily locked her bedroom door and listened in fright. A few minutes later her neck was encircled by a hand. She swooned, and when morning came was found on the floor in a dead faint. The same thing happened Wednesday night. The only explanation the doctor can offer is that Mrs. Kennie choked herself while sleeping. She is in a serious condition.\\nThe Oxford Book of Victorian Ghost Stories\\nLate Victorian Gothic Tales (Oxford World's Classics)\\nGhost-Seers, Detectives, and Spiritualists: Theories of Vision in Victorian Literature and Science (Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture)\",\n",

       " 'Congratulations – you’re here because you have a bright idea. The kind that prompts you to, pause in amazement to ask yourself why nobody ever thought of this before, tidy your desk, and start searching for advice on how to turn your brainwave into a profitable business. But where should you really begin?\\nBuilding a business is one of the greatest journeys you can embark upon. You can’t expect success overnight. Behind the meteoric rise of each ‘Uber for this’ and ‘Airbnb for that’, there are rivers of sweat, oceans of tears and months of lost sleep.\\nThe foundation of a viable business is to identify a problem and provide a good solution – or a better one than your would-be customers can currently find. You should begin by thinking through your business plan and doing your market research. Be prepared to make changes to the product and to redefine your target market in response to your findings.\\nYour next step is to get the infrastructure of success in place. Become an expert by studying up on specialist sector information. Get get a professional-looking website, clean up your social media, contribute to relevant discussions online and in person: you should be seen as an authority.\\nSelect the platforms you’ll use to market your product – does it need a video demonstration, or are you the author and sage behind the next hit eBook? Then, get to grips with Google. You’ll need to produce regular, relevant content for your site to rank highly, and understand how paid ads work in order to run campaigns or instruct an agency.\\nThink this summary sounds simple enough? You already know the roadmap to business stardom will be peppered with potholes. Here are six tips to prepare:\\n1. Get to work\\nSuccess is directly proportional to the effort you put in. You’ll be competing for funding and customers with many other companies. Most will have more capital and manpower than your business might see for another decade. If you want to get on level footing, the only way is to grind. Use size to your advantage.\\nThere’s no middle-management or bureaucracy to prevent you from experimenting with new tactics or tailoring services to a particular client’s requirements. Bonus tip? Don’t quit your day job right away. It’s incredible how much time you can free up on evenings and weekends by reducing your Netflix consumption.\\n“A business has to be involving, it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts.” – Richard Branson\\n2. Network, network, network\\nMingling, schmoozing, hobnobbing – it doesn’t come naturally to everyone. Maybe it seems pointless, or pushes you out of your comfort zone at first, but networking is an extremely valuable use of your time. Polish your LinkedIn presence, go to business networking events, reach out to people you could learn from. Join discussion forums and contribute to them.\\nYou could even consider applying to startup incubator programs such as TechStars, which offer a curated programme of introductions to both mentors and investors. You can’t predict when one of these contacts will offer a helping hand, but relationship building is key to securing support in your hour of need.\\n3. Tighten the purse strings\\nStartups don’t secure their founders a steady stream of income. There will be weeks when you’re flush, and months when your dreams of entrepreneurial success are eclipsed by dreams of a dinner that isn’t ramen. Without the privilege of a reliable income, life is easier to navigate when you’re equipped with budgeting smarts and a steely will. Get used to living within your means. Your salary cut will ultimately translate into a runway extension for your startup.\\n4. The customer is (still) king\\nYour brilliance and expertise can’t fund your startup by themselves! Customers put food on your table and sustain the viability of your business. Listen to what they want from you. Be prepared to tailor your offering to their needs. If you get an opportunity to deliver results for someone – seize it. You can offer them a perk no big business can match: flexibility.\\n5. Shortcuts leave you short-changed\\nIf a job is worth doing, it’s worth doing right first time. Don’t give investors a chance to pick holes in your business proposition by spending time and money on work that needs to be re-done. Website bugs or a ‘content farm’ blog can damage the functionality of your business as well as your reputation.\\nSure, you’ll get to the stage where your business is ready for a re-brand or an experienced hire brings in the knowledge to optimise your content, but there’s a difference between being keen to improve versus tolerating shoddy work. Get the best you can buy at every stage of growth.\\n“Don’t start a company unless it’s an obsession and something you love. If you have an exit strategy, it’s not an obsession.” – Mark Cuban\\n6. Know your ‘why’\\nWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going. But how can you cultivate this toughness? In the early stages, you may not have a co-founder or employee to share the struggle. There will be no team to carry you through phases of crippling doubt. Whether you need to adjust the feng shui of your home office, admit that breaks are crucial to your wellbeing or build opportunities to socialise with likeminded individuals into your schedule, take time to work out the foundations of your mental fortitude.\\nUnderstand your ‘why’ – the reason behind your passion that gives you a true sense of purpose. Then, work to cultivate a balance. You can’t do everything, but you can make time for family, exercise, and the little things that save your sanity. The ability to self-motivate will serve you in every area of life, whether business is your vocation or not.',\n",
       " 'Careful composition is an essential part of good photography, but even once you understand the image-arrangement fundamentals, you may struggle to capture shots that are sufficiently striking.\\nIf you feel that your images are bland and/or unoriginal, then I highly recommend you learn how to work with diagonals, which can dramatically improve your compositions. With the proper application of this technique, you can create breathtaking photos that are full of movement – and because diagonals aren’t a commonly used image element, they can help your shots stand out from the crowd.\\nIn this article, I discuss everything you need to know about diagonal arrangements, and I offer plenty of tips and examples along the way!\\nDiagonals in Photography:\\nWhat Are Diagonals in Photography?\\nDiagonals refer to tilted lines in your images, like this:\\nThey can begin at the edges of the frame and move toward the center:\\nOr they can begin in the middle of the frame and stay firmly within the center of the composition:\\nThe key thing to remember is that diagonals must be slanted. While straight lines can make for very compelling photography, slanted lines offer something different – which is why it’s worth drawing a distinction between the two.\\nWhy Are Diagonals Useful?\\nSlanted lines are powerful compositional elements because they create visual flow. In other words, they move the viewer’s eye through the frame (from one end of the line to the other).\\nSo if a diagonal begins at the edge of a composition, it draws the viewer in, and then it takes them on a journey all the way to the other end.\\nNow, you might be wondering: What’s so great about visual flow?\\nVisual flow is a fundamental part of photographic composition. If you can move the viewer through the frame, they’ll engage with the photo for longer, they’ll appreciate it more, and they’ll become (hopefully) rather captivated.\\nVisual flow is also important for another reason: It directs the viewer toward the most essential part of the photo while keeping them away from the less essential parts. Put another way, visual flow helps focus the viewer so that they’re able to understand a photo and what it’s about.\\nAnd that’s why diagonals in photography are so useful; they guide the viewer, keep them engaged, and take the viewer where you – the photographer – want them to go!\\nYou might be wondering: Where do diagonals actually come from? Well, if you look carefully enough, you can find them everywhere – especially because a straight line, positioned properly within the frame, automatically becomes a diagonal.\\nFor instance, you might find a fallen tree in a forest, which initially presents itself as a straight line. But if you change your angle, it immediately becomes a compelling diagonal, stretching from the bottom corner of the frame to the top opposite corner of the frame.\\nYou can even use horizon lines to produce the same effect. Simply find a flat horizon, then tilt your camera for a tense, disorienting, dutch-angle look!\\nYou don’t need slanted lines in every one of your photos. But they do enhance the composition by keeping the viewer both focused and engaged, so if you get the chance to incorporate diagonals into a shot, do it!\\nThe Golden Triangle\\nYou may be familiar with the golden triangle compositional overlay, which encourages you to place key elements of your composition along these gridlines:\\nAs you can see, the golden triangle overlay incorporates several very clear diagonals, from the strong line down the middle to the smaller lines coming from the other corners.\\nNote that you can use any part of the golden triangle overlay to place tilted lines in your compositions. There are a number of powerful approaches you can try, and you don’t always have to include elements that run the entire length of the shot.\\nReally, I’d urge you to experiment with positioning diagonals in different places. You can start with a slanted line that’s positioned straight through the middle of the shot – running from corner to corner – but then try moving the line more toward the middle of the frame; you can also see what happens when you let the line start outside the frame versus inside the frame (both effects are interesting!).\\nLeading lines are a popular photographic composition element, especially among landscape photographers (though plenty of other photographers also use leading lines to great effect).\\nThe idea is that a line leads the viewer up from the foreground and toward a compelling background, which creates the illusion of depth while also focusing and engaging the viewer.\\nNow, not all leading lines are diagonals. For instance, S-curves are a famous example of powerful leading lines, which wind their way up toward the back of the shot in a meandering fashion. And some leading lines are completely straight, taking the viewer up and back.\\nBut diagonals in photography are frequently featured as leading lines, and they’re extremely compelling. For instance, check out how these trees cut through the shot in order to take the viewer toward the background:\\nThat’s what diagonals can do. Don’t you feel pulled along?\\nDiagonals vs the Rule of Thirds\\nDiagonals run through the frame, well, diagonally. Whereas the rule of thirds states that the best compositions include key elements a third of the way into the frame.\\nTake a look at the rule of thirds gridlines, and you’ll notice something interesting: There are no slanted lines!\\nAnd it’s true: The rule of thirds doesn’t say anything at all about diagonals. But this isn’t because tilted lines are bad; it’s because the rule of thirds is not the only useful compositional guideline that you should follow.\\nIn fact, when you combine the rule of thirds and diagonals together, you get especially compelling images. For instance, you might position your main subject at one of the rule of thirds intersection points and then include a leading line running through as a diagonal (straight toward the main subject).\\nOr you could put your main subject around the top-third gridline, but then include several diagonal leading lines running up from the bottom of the frame. As long as you think carefully about your subject and line positioning, the results are bound to look good!\\nDiagonals and Triangles\\nI’ve talked all about diagonals and how they can help your images, but triangles are where things really come together – because triangles are diagonals arranged in a stable shape!\\nAnd triangles are very stable indeed, which is what makes them so great for photography; they combine the motion of diagonals with the stability of a fully formed shape. That’s why I recommend you incorporate strong triangles into your photography whenever possible.\\nNote that you don’t have to find full triangles to include in your compositions. You can also work with partial triangles or implied triangles, which can still result in beautiful compositions. So whenever you see the opportunity to work with triangles, take it!\\nCreate Dynamic and Unique Compositions!\\nDiagonals aren’t the most talked-about compositional element out there, but they play a key role in creating dynamic, focused images.\\nThat’s why I recommend using them whenever you can. Just experiment with positioning tilted lines at different edges of the frame as well as toward the middle, and see how your images turn out!\\nDiagonals in Photography FAQ\\nWhat are diagonals?\\nDiagonals refer to slanted lines in an image. They’re a fantastic composition element, so I recommend you use them whenever possible!\\nShould you use diagonals or the rule of thirds?\\nYou can use either one, though you can also use both diagonals and the rule of thirds together to create ultra-powerful shots!\\nShould you use diagonals or triangles in photography?\\nDiagonals are naturally a part of triangles, so the two elements go very well together. While it’s true that diagonals work well on their own, you can also create triangles out of your diagonals!\\nWhy are diagonals good for photography?\\nDiagonals are great for photography because they move the eye through the frame, and this movement helps the viewer engage with the photos.',\n",

Referred to as a cheat code this made harder tasks in the game easier: granting you unlimited lives and giving you super powers. I\\'ve found a cheat code for daily success and it all starts with a regular daily routine.\\nAs long as I can remember I\\'ve been an early riser, there is something very special, almost sacred in the silence and darkness before sunrise. I find clarity and my true self in silence and stillness. As everything / everyone starts waking up the senses within also awaken.\\nWhen I read Hal Elrod\\'s Miracle Mornings he put my thoughts and action into words. His key practices \"Life S.A.V.E.R.S\" are something everyone should think about incorporating into their daily routine. SAVERS stands for: Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading and Scribing. The 5am club from Robin Sharma had so much resounding information of things I was already doing as well. Robin discussed blocking out time for deep work, using time that you normally \\'waste\\' waiting in lines, commuting, breaks, lunches learning instead of consuming mind numbing content. Learning skills and getting better really is possible.\\nIf you have a daily routine of 1 hour a day 5 days a week. In 5 years you will have spent 1,300 hours on self-care and self improvement. That’s basically 162 x 8 hour work days!! I think you should have a daily routine 7 days a week, but everyone needs to design a plan that works for them.\\nIf you focus on yourself for 1300 hours you are going to come out a champion before 5 years. This is how small bits of focused time work over longer periods. This is your path to freedom and happiness.\\nFilm Review (my experience)\\nThe past year I\\'ve found a really sweet game plan for my daily routine. I\\'ve noticed huge change in my attitude, my health, and my wealth. I\\'m going to share what I do, not because I think you should copy it, but maybe something inspires a thought or idea for you\\nMy morning routine actually begins before I go to bed. I read my hand written affirmations before bed and I think about the next day, I set a couple intentions and my most important goal(s) for the upcoming day (write them down, keep a journal near the bed). I express gratitude for 3 things. Then I sleep.\\nI don\\'t need an alarm clock, somehow I tend to wake up between 4:45 and 5:15am no matter what time zone I\\'m in. I don\\'t have specific\"work hours\" so the hour variance doesn\\'t matter to me. It’s a running joke that my body somehow knows the local time? I don\\'t know, I just embrace this internal clock.\\nBefore getting out of bed I say thanks for another day, I run through a gratitude list. I rise with energy, I say my affirmations (always out loud) and review my goals for the day.\\nI play the morning rampage from Abraham Hicks while I make my coffee.\\nI spend some time in meditation. Don\\'t over think meditation, just practice nothingness! Don\\'t Google \"am I meditating correctly\" that means you are overthinking...\\nI also really enjoy morning walks/jogs at daybreak. Watching the sun rise, looking at nature and reflecting on just how much space there is. Thinking how many molecules make up a tree. How much space there is between branches, how much space there is between mountains, valleys, the moon, the sun. We are really small, even if the ego wants us to think we\\'re important.\\nI then take a few moments to journal key thoughts, anything significant that I\\'m feeling thinking or ideas.\\nThis takes me about an hour. Sometimes longer depending on distance I choose to walk/jog.\\nI think a lot about ego and judgement in my life. I don\\'t want either to over crowd or take control. I hope you will also start thinking about ego and judgements as your biggest opponents. We can be a huge obstacle and our fiercest opponent.\\nI\\'d like to mention a couple things I don\\'t particularly think about even though several books mention this… I do not think about what others do in their morning routines. I don\\'t consider what \"failures\" do when I made up my morning routine. I don\\'t care what a \"failure\" does. Don\\'t give your time and energy to negatives, feed the positive! Your routine should not be designed to sound good, or contain components that you think others want to hear. Just because Hal says get up at 5am, that doesn\\'t mean you should. Maybe you are a member of the 7am or 10am club.\\nEveryone needs to make a daily routine, and I think you should make an hour for yourself every morning! If that means you have to change your schedule you should. If you don\\'t have enough time for yourself, what kind of life are you living? And, yes, I know children and jobs make it more challenging, but we all have time its just how we use our time (tiktok, instagram, facebook, television, etc)…\\nI\\'d like to urge you to think about what works best for you without thinking about how much better you are than people who don\\'t have routines. Your actions your routine should not be based on negative energy or other peoples thoughts or labels… That isn\\'t the mind of a championship coach. It\\'s not sustainable to stay consistent when you don\\'t believe in your process. Don\\'t give attention to others, your success, and your progress is for you, no one else.\\nOffensive Game Plan (actions to obtain freedom)\\nCommit to making a daily routine. I\\'m not asking you to commit to a full hour a day until you are ready. But start with 15 minutes, add another 5 or 10 minutes. Find what works for you, and give yourself a chance to see results. Do not expect that things are going to suddenly shift after the first day or the first week. Its very possible they will if you keep an open minds, but your intention here is just as important as the process. Remember small chunks of time where you give full attention add up!\\nI will get into greater details about the importance of each of these in upcoming posts, but for now I want you to commit creating a daily routine, and I want you to start this week with the following G.A.M.E. plan\\nGratitude, Affirmation, Meditation, Education\\nLets start off simple. Before you go to bed tonight I want you to write down (yes write it on paper!) 3 things you are grateful for. You can go as deep or shallow as you want with the gratitude statements, if you are having a tough week, be grateful you have arms or legs or eyes… The more meaningful the better, if you are ready to switch these up every day that is awesome!\\nAlso write down at least 3 statements of affirmations that start with the words \"I am\". The I am statements should reflect the best part of you and it\\'s fine to speak about your future vision of yourself. ( I am strong, I am wealthy, I am going to impact many lives, I am powerful, I am an amazing spouse/parent…). I will do an entire post on affirmations as I strongly believe in them to achieve freedom, purpose, and power!\\nFor the next week you will read/write your gratitude statements and recite your affirmations EVERY night and EVERY morning. Bonus points if you read them out loud, also you should do this in front of a mirror for the best results.\\nPractice Meditation: Try a guided meditation if you are new to meditation. Start with simple meditations focusing on breath. You can use youtube or an app like calm. If you are more advanced you can do your own meditation. The point is practice this every single day for at least 5 mins. Work up to 15-30 mins. Don\\'t worry if you are doing it \"right\" just do it! Try to think about nothing. Set a timer and practice!\\nEducation: Spend 15-20 minutes learning something important to you. Watch a video, read an article, grow your expertise! It\\'s important to spend some time each morning improving your knowledge. We all need improvement. Every great coach/mentor I have still learns and improves daily.\\nDefensive Game Plan (actions to defend your freedom)\\nFind the time for yourself. We all have busy schedules, block the defense who is looking to tackle you at a moment\\'s notice! The time you take for yourself actually helps everyone and everything around you, it seems counter intuitive at first, but starting your day with a daily routine is life changing.\\nResist the urge to check text messages, social media, check stock market futures or watch the news as soon as you wake up. This was hard for me initially, and some days when I\\'m opening up the morning rampage the notifications are tempting. If you resist the urge to let other outside forces set your daily tone and thoughts you can not believe the power and freedom YOU can create. You set the tone for your day, no one else!\\nDon\\'t let doubt, failure or missing a day or two stop you. This is about consistency and trying new morning tactics to start off your day. Just get back in your routine when the defense tackles you. Don\\'t fall into victim mode, just get right back into the routine.\\nAudible: (unplanned changes to the plan)\\nChange up your routine after a couple weeks to what works best for you. Just remember to give this all a chance and don\\'t quit any of the key areas I described above. These are important to success, but everyone is different so it makes sense to make your routine your own.\\nDo not tell yourself or me you don\\'t have time for this. That is a personal foul with extreme consequences. You make time for things you want to do. Our yourself first and remember we all make time for things we want to do. Maybe less time on tiktok, less time watching whatever popular series is streaming right now... If you are serious about freedom and happiness don\\'t make this excuse.\\nPost-Game Review (key takeaway)\\nHow you start your day is really important. While every day won\\'t be perfect a daily routine that you design that fits your lifestyle makes success so much easier. Consistency is key! It\\'s called a routine because it needs to become a daily habit to really see the results and feel the power!\\nHey Coach!

       " 'Get your copy of the 7th Annual State of Smart Manufacturing and hear from 300+ manufacturers in this new survey report!\\nDeveloping a global sourcing model to serve a world-wide customer base as well as to manage global operations in a seamless way, manufacturers have adopted a ‘build anywhere-ship anywhere strategy.’ Adopting a cloud manufacturing system is emerging as the best strategy to quickly enable these capabilities.\\nNo doubt global markets are enticing to manufacturers, since firms want to place manufacturing close to customers or take advantage of low-cost-country sourcing. If the goal is to service global markets, then three major objectives need to be achieved simultaneously. One is to find and achieve a cost model that reflects a fair global price point for products. The next is to achieve the global strategy, yet somehow stay close to customer markets. Lastly, manufacturers face the challenge of an expertise shortage, so finding the best talent to stay competitive can be difficult.\\nFrom start-up until stability is achieved, managing the global processes continues to be a key challenge for manufacturers. Firms are seeking ways to leverage process and expertise on a global basis, yet they lack a method to establish and maintain cohesion. Software is a method for establishing and codifying business processes. But if organizations set up new plants in isolation, they lose the opportunity to establish cohesion with the rest of the enterprise.\\nHaving traveled the world installing on-premise systems, several weaknesses in an on-premise-software-and- process-plants approach became apparent:\\nThe additional risk is that ‘local control’ of the software implicitly means the plant either will go its own way or be starved in some way for information. Not a good strategy for controlling costs and creating that global sourcing strategy within your company or with your customers.\\nIf we see software as the means with which to codify the corporate M.O., then the approach we use to implement software and how we use it to control the process is all-important. Many global companies have been implementing a global cloud single instance for the enterprise. A multi-tenant cloud approach can help address the challenges mentioned above.\\nHere are some benefits, from start-up to stability, which we see:\\nStage One—Bringing Plants Online. Huge losses can accrue if projects go over budget and are late. The losses don’t affect just operational costs; a resulting lack of competitiveness and/or revenue can affect the company for a long time. By using a cloud software solution, the following advantages can be attained: IT challenges associated with onsite installation and integration are reduced. Employees can get trained quickly so they can address localization adaptations and go live with less anxiety and fewer delays.\\nStage Two—Establishing and Maintaining Continuity and Cohesion. Over the long term (which happens sooner than you think), companies need to think about how each plant supports the whole. How does that plant establish and maintain an integrative strategy and set of workflows with the rest of the company and trading partners? Some of the areas in which strong integration is required are:\\nStage Three—Change Management. Ultimately, change happens. Change management across sites can be maddeningly frustrating, not only due to divergent approaches, but the complexity of moving to the new process in a synchronized way. A diverse IT portfolio is a major obstacle to process, product, or market changes.\\nAs customers and products change, if product and process can’t quickly adapt, companies lose that global flexibility to respond to their markets. Global sourcing advantages fade and costs increase. Building in adaptability with a highly configurable cloud solution that is architecturally designed in a continuous deployment mode allows for agility and balance across global resources. It allows bringing the best talent and ideas forward to solve world-wide challenges.\\nGlobal trade has allowed businesses to take advantage of new and innovative resources and new opportunities. At the same time, managing the entire global process has become a lot more complex. It requires a cohesive, unifying, adaptive system. Cloud technology has provided an excellent foundation: one set of rules, unambiguous process guidelines and communications, and real-time data visible to all parties are only some of its benefits.\\nThe global availability of new markets, a global work force, and coordinated transportation make businesses more competitive. To survive in this environment, companies cannot afford to believe in the status quo. To excel, they have to use technologies that integrate the globe.\\n Labor may be plentiful, but the more technical professions such as plant design and engineering, product and materials engineering, manufacturing IT, and supply chain all have a global shortage.\\n Modus operandi',\n",

       " \"Another Place Productions' current home - a modest studio in Southeast London - is its ninth since forming in 2012.\\nThere are various reasons for such a quick turnaround in office space, but the principal one is growth.\\nWhile by no means a juggernaut, Another Place has expanded comfortably from three co-founders to a lucky team of 13.\\nWhile there, they worked under Peter Molyneux - primarily on the critically-acclaimed Fable series - and began a friendly working relationship that's spanned almost a decade.\\nTexier remembers his time at Lionhead fondly, but recalls the frustrations that led to his pursuit of Another Place. Frustrations shared, as it turns out, by his fellow co-founders.\\n“Because it's such a big corporation, whatever it is you do, whatever role you have, you have very little control over what the game will end up being like from creation to being in the market,” he reflects.\\n“We wanted to have a project that we owned from start to finish.”\\nThis was the shared sentiment that birthed Another Place Productions in 2012, but the vision for what said project should be was altogether less clear.\\nWe realised mobile would be the best way for us to completely own a project from creation to publishing.Jeremie Texier\\nEstablished just as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were reaching the end of their lives, but with Xbox One and PlayStation 4 still yet to be revealed, 2012 was something of a no man's land for a newly-established studio.\\nThe original plan was to digitally distribute through Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Store, and the trio's Lionhead background made sure that there was no shortage of interest from publishers and platform holders.\\nThis, however, was the exactly what they had parted ways with Lionhead to avoid.\\n“We realised [mobile] would be the best way for us to completely own a project from creation to publishing, so it was in December 2012 that we decided to focus completely on mobile,” says Texier.\\nWith that decided, the biggest priority for the team was to get something out as quickly as possible in an attempt to get a handle on (and prove its commitment to) the vastly different landscape of free-to-play mobile development.\\nWhen it came to conceptualising that all-important debut title, it was angel investor Chris Lee - a Partner at Another Place who “has been involved from pretty much day one” - who made the crucial suggestion.\\nLee advised the team to take inspiration from Qi Studios' PC title Rag Doll Kung Fu, a game which allowed the player to exploit the character's ragdoll physics to create clumsy, flailing-limbs combat.\\n“We thought the opportunity was great,” says Texier. “[It enabled us to] focus on all the other aspects and think, 'how can we turn this into our first free-to-play title?'”\\nLearn by doing\\nThis is what went on to become Dragon Finga, and it came with three major objectives from Another Place: short development time, an accomplished end product, and - most importantly - to gain experience in the market.\\n“We felt we knew how to make a good game, so our expectation was that it would be well-rated and liked,” recalls Texier.\\n“But, in terms of monetisation, we weren't expecting it to do very well because it was our first go.”\\nIndeed, Portes adds that it was “a complete gamble” to opt for a skill-based arcade game, a genre that's “very hard to succeed with” in terms of monetisation.\\nAs you'd expect of a project started by three developers with no mobile background (with a fourth joining halfway through) there were mistakes.\\nFirst off, Texier reports that the team learnt “very little” from Dragon Finga's brief soft launch because it was “too short and we [already] knew what needed to be changed.”\\nTrial and error\\nDragon Finga was a gentle ramp-up into live operations.Guillaume Portes\\nSecondly, despite “a lot of love from Apple” propelling the game (launched September 2013) to around a million downloads in the first week, the game was monetising poorly.\\n“And yet people were still playing it, Texier recalls, “so from September to November we were trying to fix the monetisation side without affecting the way people were playing and the retention.”\\nAfter a period of “trial and error,” Another Place launched a new build of Dragon Finga in late November 2013 - “and indeed, everything went up without affecting retention.”\\nWhile not a connected game on the scale of second game BattleHand, Portes describes this experience as “a gentle ramp-up into live operations,” culminating in a costume update in January 2014 that saw Dragon Finga re-featured by Apple.\\n“That was exciting stuff,” says Texier. “It validated all our changes.”\\nIn many ways, Dragon Finga was Another Place attempting to prove itself.\\nPortes refers to a lot of “failure in converting” among developers swapping console for mobile at the time, and a determination to prove that the studio was more than just another failed experiment.\\nMcCormack adds that he, Portes, and Texier established Another Place with the belief that their background as esteemed console developers would give them some kind of head-start in mobile - an assumption he now calls “so naive.”\\nThe reality, he quickly found, was quite the opposite.\\n“[Console developers] are seen as people who take years to make games that cost a lot of money, which is not what people want to hear when it comes to mobile, especially VCs,” he says.\\n“It was important for us to prove that we could make a game, release it, and get good reception in 6 months - and we did it.”\\nTime to grow\\nConsole devs are seen as taking years and lots of money to make games - not what VCs want to hear.John McCormack\\nWith targets met and a line drawn under Dragon Finga as “a great learning experience,” Another Place had shown itself to be a capable mobile studio - and one that wasn't going to retreat to the comforting familiarity of console development anytime soon.\\nThis attracted the interest of Initial Capital and Connect Ventures, who invested in the company in May 2014.\\nInvestment afforded the studio some stability, and the capital to build a team to develop RPGs - which had been the ultimate aim from the studio's inception.\\n“It works out well if you look at our passion, the team's skillset, and the market; RPG ticks all three boxes,” considers Texier.\\nPlaying its cards right\\nBattleHand began life, on a conceptual level, as an Eye of the Beholder-style dungeon crawler with Dragon's Lair-inspired visuals.\\nOpting to avoid direct character control (“too unwieldy” on mobile) and to keep session length as short as possible without resorting to autoplay, Another Place soon arrived at the card-based combat that forms BattleHand as we know it today.\\nSoft-launched in March 2015 (self-published), the firm learned from its mistakes with Dragon Finga by giving BattleHand “much longer” in soft launch.\\nThis time, it proved far more useful.\\n“We were capturing a slightly more casual, adventure game audience [in soft launch] than the RPG card players [we were after],” recalls Texier.\\nThis was all well and good for acquiring users, but it wouldn't help BattleHand to retain them over the long term.\\n“The feedback was suggesting that we needed to go either casual or hardcore,” says Portes. “Being in the middle wouldn't work for the game.”\\nNow committed to going “the full monty in terms of depth,” Another Place spent May and June “rebuilding entirely.”\\n“Now we had a goal, we had an audience, we knew what to do - it was very efficient.”\\nOn the dotted line\\nIn September 2015, BattleHand was signed up for a publishing deal by Kongregate. The two companies had been in contact since April, with Another Place reporting “really good chemistry” between them.\\nWe're really happy with the engagment for a game that still has a lot of features to come.Jeremie Texier\\nBattleHand was finally launched in January 2016, but still has many features yet to be added.\\n“We're all happy, this is a very solid start,” enthuses Texier.\\n“We're incredibly happy with the engagement for a game which is currently a single campaign, asynchronous PvP which has no competitive element, and survival mode - there's a lot more to come.”\\nMcCormack may hate the term 'Games-as-a-Service', but he appears to love its implications as Another Place continues to work on its first truly live, connected F2P experience.\\n“When we were making console games, we were not talking to anybody and then releasing it… it's like a closed world, you're split off a little from the people playing it,” he says.\\nNow running competitions and getting suggestions direct from the community, that couldn't be more different from the reality Another Place is currently experiencing.\\nHaving successfully escaped the disconnected and creatively stifling world of triple-A to make games on its own terms, Another Place has quickly gone from new kid on the block to a stable, established member of the London development scene.\\n“If you spend months learning, and release a game before others, then it's turn to return the favour,” says Texier of the collaborative relationship among London's studios.\\nOriginally chosen simply by virtue of its convenient links to both Guildford (where Portes and Texier are still based) and Brighton (McCormack's home), England's capital also offers a number of additional benefits.\\nAs well as boasting far more mobile game studios than the “very console-based” Guildford, it's also home to both Google and Apple, and a convenient place to host potential visitors to the studio from overseas.\\nThe three co-founders behind Another Place have managed to find the freedom they left Lionhead to pursue, and seem very content with the place they have carved out for themselves in mobile development.\\nThe studio has made the console-mobile transition wholeheartedly, with respect and appreciation for free-to-play that shines through in its ethos and its games.\\nHaving learnt much from both Dragon Finga and BattleHand, and with the latter still very much a work in progress, there's a feeling that the best is yet to come for Another Place.\",\n",

       " 'Almost two years into this pandemic, there are few who have not experienced a holistic change in their personal and professional lives. The pandemic has had an indelible impact on the nature of professional work for almost everyone. Most employees have been encouraged to work from home during the COVID period. While working from home has been a fairly straightforward transition for many employees, it has nonetheless presented challenges for managers in keeping the performance of their employees up to the mark.\\nWhat is needed is for organizations to reshape the skills of their managers. This can be accomplished by training managers to shift their mindset away from traditional managing to a new management style in order to be successful. The five skills managers require to get the desired results that can assist them in this uncertain business environment are:\\n- Critical thinking\\n- Remote communication\\n- Emotional intelligence\\n- Innovation & creativity\\nWe’ll explore each in further detail below.\\nMost businesses worldwide are operating online; it is highly likely that this will continue even after the pandemic. It has become very important for managers to be resilient. Resilience and flexibility are about having a broad mindset when directing employees who work remotely and readjusting the working framework during the pandemic.\\nCritical thinking is one of the top managerial skills required in this Covid era. In the pandemic, the use of social media has become very common. As a result, there is a lot of divergent and often contradicting data on the internet. It is certainly the need of the hour that managers should develop strong critical thinking skills to evaluate the available information in order to make the correct decisions.\\nCommunication with the Team Working in a Remote Environment\\nCommunication is a challenge when your team is working remotely. A good manager should establish good communication channels to get the employees’ best performance especially when they are working remotely. This includes active listening, and the right level of virtual meetings, emails, and phone calls to assist employees to understand the task better.\\nEmotional intelligence is a very vital element of managerial skills nowadays. It means being aware of the emotional well-being of your team members. A manager needs to check the mental health of their employees, especially during times like these when everyone is already so tense due to the pandemic. Moreover, the manager should encourage employees when they are performing their best, keep their spirits high, and give them a break when needed.\\nInnovation and Creativity\\nIt wouldn’t be wrong to say that innovation and creativity are much-needed managerial skills, for the following reasons:\\n- To make employees more productive, a manager needs to be creative and innovative when assigning tasks to employees. Creativity and the ability to understand each team members individual motivational “value drivers” is necessary so that employees do not lose interest in the task.\\n- To make businesses successful in the challenging environment of the pandemic, over-performance is only possible when a culture of continuous innovation and creativity has been built.\\nGiven that the pandemic has reshaped the world, managers can successfully steer their teams out of the current stressful environment by using new managerial skills in a fresh and super-efficient way. After all, change and innovation are the need of the hour in every aspect of life in this pandemic!',\n",

       " \"Folate in Pregnancy: Why Folic Acid is the Supplement of Choice\\nPregnancy is a critical period in a woman's life, and proper nutrition is paramount for the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. One essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in fetal development is folate. However, there has been a lot of talk regarding which type of folate is the optimal choice in pregnancy. Today, we will explore the differences between methylated folate and folic acid and discuss which may be the better choice during pregnancy.\\nWhy is folate so important in pregnancy?\\nFolate, a B-vitamin, is vital for the formation of DNA and the development of the neural tube in the early stages of pregnancy. Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida or anencephaly, can occur when there is a deficiency in folate. To prevent such complications, we recommend folate supplementation during pregnancy.\\nWhat is Methylated Folate?\\nThere has been increasing recommendations on the internet for reproductive age women or those who are trying to conceive to take Methylated folate, also known as 5-MTHF (5-methyltetrahydrofolate). This is because some individuals may have gotten tested for MTHFR deficiency*. MTHFR is the protein that helps the body process folate, while Methylated folate is a folate supplement which is the biologically active form.\\nNow, even though someone has an MTHFR gene variation, studies have shown that the body can still process all types of folate including folic acid.\\nEnter Folic Acid\\nIn general, it is recommended for all reproductive age women to obtain 400mcg of folic acid every day. If someone has a history of a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect then it is recommended to consume 4000mcg of folic acid each day.\\nMost importantly, folic acid is the only type of folate supplement that has been scientifically studied and proven to prevent neural tube defects. Not only is it widely accessible, but also cost-effective. Therefore, folic acid is the folate supplementation of choice in pregnancy over methylated folate.\\nAs always, feel free to bring us any questions you have about supplements that are recommended and/or safe in pregnancy during your visits!\\n(*In the past, there was increased screening for MTHFR gene variations/deficiency in relation to inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy and recurrent pregnancy loss. However due to lacking evidence in its significance, it is not currently recommended to screen for MTHFR gene variants/deficiency.)\",\n",

       " \"Why Foam Rolling And Stretching Isn’t Helping your client’s mobility (and what to do instead)Feb 27, 2023\\nAre you finding that your clients often prefer to just skip their “mobility work?” That they just half-ass their stretching and aimlessly squish their quads, glutes and back on the foam roller without much intention? Well, I would too; that shit is boring, and there is a better way to make progress that is far more exciting for your clients as well.\\nIn this article, we’ll have a look at the most common approaches to mobility, why they generally don’t work the way people want them to, and how you, as the coach, can start elevating the mobility game and start to become known as a mobility expert in your community.\\nLet’s get into it!\\nFoam Rolling For Mobility\\nLet’s start off with foam rolling (or any variation of muscle smashing/SMR - Self Myofascial Release). See, foam rolling is often used as an attempted solution to an ongoing, seemingly endless problem. While it’s been getting a lot of heat lately for being a complete waste of time, I have my own opinions on it that I think help everyone win. There are 2 main reasons why foam rolling is such a popular approach to “improving mobility”.\\n- It feels damn good (sometimes in such a painful way)\\n- It offers immediate and very temporary improvements to range of motion and reduction to the perception of pain (the results here are often only present for up to 4 hours)\\nBoth of these benefits are immediately gratifying, which makes it a very appealing approach. If it works so well, why wouldn’t I use it? Well, the problem isn’t that foam rolling doesn’t work; it’s just that it doesn’t work the way most people actually think it works, and their approach to foam rolling reflects that.\\nFoam Rolling For Range Of Motion\\nOur range of motion is governed by our nervous system. In order to create real, genuine, long-term results for our ROM and ultimately reduce the amount of unnecessary stress being placed on our joints and muscle tissue during our training, we need to have greater influence over our nervous system’s response that creates a muscular restriction in the first place. Foam rolling alone does not do this (imagine me intensely and passionately clapping in between each word here).\\nThere are some fascinating concepts behind this which we won’t dive into right now (the myotatic reflex), but the most important thing to remember is that you must find a way to influence the nervous system. I know that this might sound complex at face value, but I’ve found that the simplest way to look at this is to think of it as “building trust” in the deep ranges of motion. In order to improve your range of motion for a longer period of time, you have to show the body that it can handle the deeper, funky positions you’re looking to get it into. This means you need to foster control and strength. This is exactly why the body reverts back to its previous state so quickly after foam rolling. The surface pressure of the roller offers instant feedback to the nervous system, but the body quickly realizes that no genuine change has been made.\\nHow To Use Foam Rolling With Clients\\nNow, I’m gonna go out on a hunch here and say that I’m pretty damn sure you’re an amazing coach, and since you’re reading this article, you are dedicated to continuing to grow and master your craft. And I know I’m right…so I also know that you want better pain reduction, ROM improvement, performance enhancement, and results for your clients. So just know that if your clients seem to enjoy foam rolling, there's absolutely no reason to take it out of their rotation. It can actually be a helpful tool in ROM progression. Just make sure you’re making efforts toward developing control and strength in the deep ranges of motion to make any real, lasting progress. The foam roller also has somewhat of a “down-regulating” effect on the nervous system that seems to calm rather than “excite”. This makes foam rolling generally a better method to be used post-workout rather than pre-workout. Either way, I won’t tell you exactly how to use it because I believe that you know your clients best and that every case deserves a unique approach, but hopefully, the facts are clear, and you understand how you can best manipulate the roller to your advantage.\\nBenefits of foam rolling/muscle smashing/SMR:\\n- Reduced perception of pain/physical discomfort\\n- Temporarily improved range of motion\\n- Temporary reduction of joint tension\\n- A good tool for tissue health and maintenance\\n- A great tool to help reduce DOMS and improve recovery\\n*Personally, I haven’t needed to use a foam roller for years, and the majority of our clients have completely ditched theirs as they no longer feel the need for it anymore either. Improving mobility is a fantastic way to have people forget about the roller.\\nOnce realizing that foam rolling is not mobility training, we can start to dive a little deeper and look at the next most popular approach that seems to have no real agenda behind it - stretching.\\nStretching For Mobility\\nAlright, alright, alright…don’t even think about jumping on my back about this one. If you know me at all at this point, you should already know that I’m not about to say that there are no benefits to stretching (I mean, for god's sake, I literally said there is a benefit to foam rolling, which is probably the most useless approach to improving mobility). I believe that everything has its pros and cons, and it’s how we choose to use it that dictates how effective it is. So let me clarify even more here, when I say stretching, I’m referring to static passive or dynamic passive stretching*.\\nStretching For ROM\\nAs previously explained above, ROM progress comes from the recognition of the nervous system that the human body can manage the deep ranges of motion. This truly only begins to happen for us when we can prove that we can control those particular positions. Maybe this could help paint the picture, how common do you think it is for someone to sit in a pigeon pose for a few minutes, stretch their hip flexors in a couch stretch, stretch their calves to open up their ankles, but still make no genuine change to their overall comfort and depth to their squat? Pretty friggin common…It isn’t until we begin applying engagement, displaying control, and developing strength in our ROM that we start to see those types of changes. Our nervous system has seen that we can handle them and trusts that we won’t get injured, so it grants us access to greater ranges. It’s simple, I like analogies to help me grasp concepts, so think of it this way - similar to how a mother will tell her children, “if you finish your plate, you can have more potatoes”, your body will tell you “if you can control your deepest range of motion, you can have more range of motion”. So I guess range of motion = potatoes…\\nAs always, don’t hesitate to keep stretching into your client’s mobility protocol. It’s a very important piece of the puzzle as it will help set the stage for what needs to come next. But don’t leave it at that, you’re missing out on a lot of potato gains.\\n*Static Passive = stretching a muscle(s) without actively engaging muscles and without movement (ie. classic pigeon or couch stretch)\\nDynamic Passive = stretching a muscle(s) without actively engaging muscles with movement (ie. any passive flow type stretching)\\nSo, let’s go a little bit further and actually give you some tools to use with your clients that will make a legitimate impact on how they feel, how they move, and how they perform. Let’s dive into a few of the individual pillars of the Primal Method, and I’ll even give you a few of our exercises so you can learn why and how you should be doing them.\\nIn a world-class mobility training program, there will be multiple components that are touched on in order to offer the greatest results. *Each of these components makes up a pillar in the Primal Method (we have 5 pillars in our methodology, but I’ve taken one out for this article because all exercises should improve Awareness & Connection) and are strategically placed in order to help lay a foundation for the next. Since I’ll be discussing each component in fine detail in my next article (where I’ll teach you how to build a world-class mobility training program that actually gets your clients results), let’s just cut to the chase and have a look at some exercises you can start using to help your clients right away.\\n*The Primal Method consists of 5 pillars that are strategically placed in a logical order for fluent mobility progression\\n- Awareness & Connection\\n- Build New Ranges\\n- Movement Control\\nExercises For Range Of Motion\\nI probably don’t have to offer you any exercises for the Build New Ranges pillar, but I will anyway because I think the nuances of the exercises actually matter. To increase our range of motion, we’ll want to have a quick impact on the tissues and nervous system. This can be done quickly through short, isometric contractions in a technique called PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation) or through passive-based stretching (you can even do foam rolling here, but it certainly isn’t my favourite approach as it has the most marginal effect on the nervous system so the results may be limited). Even with a static passive stretching approach, it’s important to remember the intention behind what it is that you’re trying to achieve with the stretch. Most people will blindly get into a position and assume they're doing something, but there's likely a better way, so show you one classic static stretch and two PNF-based stretches.\\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build new ranges of motion with your clients:\\n- Strict Static Couch - https://youtu.be/IfmiloFE7XE\\n- 2. Hip Flexor PNF: https://youtu.be/qiW_tKXeyLA\\n- 3. Breathing Frog: https://youtu.be/KUQ44hmXZ0U\\nExercises For Stability\\nBuilding stability is often a wonderfully awful experience. This is where you first begin to communicate with the nervous system that you’re in charge and that you want to keep those stubborn ranges of motion. It’s where you first start expressing your dominance over the autonomic responses that the nervous system has spent however much time instilling. It’s tough, it’s unpleasant, and it’s amazing. Once you begin to foster stability, you lay a beautifully well-built foundation for movement control. Stability exercises are generally done in the particular ranges of motion that we want to improve and in an isometric manner. Training isometrically helps us teach our muscles to contract and engage more efficiently in the deepest ranges of motion that are often very unfamiliar. Be prepared for some shaking, complaining, and some serious burning, but to feel fantastic afterward!\\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build ROM stability for your clients:\\n- Deep Lunge Iso: https://youtu.be/PKbqZNikTF8\\n- 2. Tall Frog ISO: https://youtu.be/Lojlxp1U72o\\n- 3. Front Split Liftoff ISO: https://youtu.be/hjcFH9MtvVU\\nExercises For Movement Control\\nMovement control is the next logical step toward building strong, “bulletproof” mobility. Once you have begun communicating with the nervous system about how you plan to take over the world (at least you’ll feel that way once you start developing control), you can step your game up, elevate the stakes, and start to apply movement. With stability, we focus on isometrics to lay the foundation; in movement control, we generally focus on eccentrics, as well as deep ROM activation exercises. This further cements the influence you have over your nervous system's autonomic responses (excitability of the myotatic reflex) and helps you hold onto your results to ultimately show it whose boss (strength, what I actually mean is strength, your nervous system is still pretty much the boss, and it only allows you to do certain things once you’ve actually put the work in to prove you can handle it. We’re just a pawn in the nervous system's game).\\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build movement control for your clients:\\n- Dorsiflexion Squats: https://youtu.be/oUsc4goHsG8\\n- 2. Shoulder Levers: https://youtu.be/qflmMGmOYpA\\n- 3. Standing Hip CARs: https://youtu.be/oqNJ-TZw5mo\\nExercises For Strength\\nNow we’re really cookin’... With strength comes true opportunity. Opportunity to make sustainable changes to your “baseline” mobility. Where you will have the chance to create a new foundation for what your nervous system “reverts back to” in the future. Now your nervous system truly believes that you can handle deep ROM and will have no problem offering those ranges to you without a second thought. You’ll notice fewer restrictions, less pain/discomfort, improved positions, improved recovery, etc. It’s common for many people to not even realize how much progress they’ve made once strength is built because they will often reach a “new end-range” that provides the same “tight” feelings the old end-range did. Clients will have gained 3 inches of ROM without realizing it simply because of how smooth and fluid it feels. That’s what you want. You want it to be so good that they completely forget how bad it was in the first place. Let’s dive in.\\nHere are 3 exercises that you can use to build ROM strength for your clients:\\n- Hip Flexion Holds: https://youtu.be/3TANnZcH_VQ\\n- 2. Ankle Reapers: https://youtu.be/FdNJZFhpPfs\\n- 3. Primal Shoulder Checks: https://youtu.be/5p7PnqxAAH\\nAt the end of the day, what your clients care most about is the results. How they get those results is up to you as the coach. You can keep the foam rolling and keep that passive stretching approach, but make sure you are doing more than that to offer legitimate, long-term results that your clients will rave about. It won’t necessarily make them look better naked (I mean, indirectly, it might), but it will have them feeling stronger, standing taller, feeling more confident in their body, and feeling so free that they forget they even had pain.\\nIf you want to become known as the mobility expert in your gym, your community, or your industry…don’t hesitate to join us and let us show you the ways. We’ll teach you every single detail about what it takes to be a world-class mobility coach, how to dive into a tight niche that solves a big problem, and how to take that knowledge and make some solid money with it by helping more people.\\nIf you care about being a world-class coach and elevating the industry by becoming one of the best mobility coaches on the planet, I want to work with you!\\nClick here to check out the details of the Primal Mobility Certification.\",\n",

       " 'Estimated taxes are tax payments made by self-employed individuals. The IRS requires most of your tax liability to be paid by the due date. W-2 employees, most of the time, can satisfy this requirement by having the relevant taxes withheld from each paycheck, while self-employed individuals and business owners make estimated payments throughout the year.\\nIf you are self-employed or receive income with no withholdings, you likely need to make estimated tax payments. In addition to self-employment income, receiving income from the following sources requires estimated tax payments:\\nInvestment income – such as from a rental property\\nPartnership or S co\\nent distributions (From certain retirement accounts)\\nUnemployment income where you choose to have no withholdings\\nIt is important to note that if you are a W-2 employee and receive income that has no withholdings, you will need to send estimated tax payments for the non-W-2 income.\\nIf your income is relatively constant year to year, the simplest way to calculate your estimated tax payments is to take the previous year’s tax liability and divide by four. Because your income remains steady each year, the previous year’s tax bill should come very close to this year’s tax bill.\\nFor example, suppose you are a tradesman or skilled laborer whose tax bill for the last four years has been $40,000. In this case, you would take the $40,000 and divide it by four, and make four equal payments of $10,000 to satisfy your tax requirements for this year. If you think you may earn a little more this year, it is a good idea to use 110% of the previous year’s bill, which would be $44,000.\\nIf your income varies from year to year, another method to calculate your estimated tax is to use your earnings in the year so far.\\nFor example, suppose you have a skilled labor or tradesman business and you calculate you owe $5,000 for the first estimated payment. You could use the $5,000 as a baseline to calculate your next payment and make any necessary adjustments as you get more information.\\nEstimated taxes are made quarterly. Here is the schedule for 2023.\\nFirst payment due – April 18, 2023\\nSecond payment due – June 15, 2023\\nThird payment due – September 15, 2023\\nFourth payment due – January 15, 2024\\nThese dates are not ironclad. Stay up-to-date on tax deadlines with our new digital tax calendar that syncs directly with the calendar tool you already use.\\nMany taxpayers find it easier to make payments more often. For example, if you are a busy tradesman and prefer making smaller payments more often, you can send tax payments each month.\\nLet’s walk through a detailed example to show the entire process of calculating estimated taxes. Suppose Bob is a self-employed tradesman who uses skilled labor to complete client projects. Bob estimates he will earn $100,000 this year because his income has been around this amount the last five years.\\nAfter taking all his deductions, Bob calculates his taxable income at $70,000. Bob next multiplies his taxable income by his marginal tax rate to arrive at his tax liability.\\nBob is a single filer, so his marginal tax rate is 22%. $70,000*.22 = $15,400. Bob’s estimated tax liability is $15,400. Bob wants to pay taxes quarterly, so he will send the quarterly IRS payments of $3,850 no later than by the relevant deadlines.\\nOrganization is important in all aspects of business, especially so when calculating your estimated tax payments. Updating your books regularly to ensure income and expenses are accurate and current is a great way to take some of the stress out of making quarterly payments.\\nStaying organized also helps avoid penalties from the IRS for incorrect or late tax payments. Even if you have a refund coming, the IRS can charge you penalties for late or incorrect payments.\\nOne benefit of making estimated tax payments is that the payments can smooth out your cash flow throughout the year. Making quarterly payments of $2,500 each over the course of the year is likely preferable to making a $10,000 payment by the April tax deadline.\\nThis can be important for a seasonal tradesman or skilled labor business.\\nAs a busy service-based business owner, you know how busy tax season can get.

       " 'As an anthropologist and health services researcher who is interested in patient-provider communication, I (GF) observe clinical encounters. I get to see the diverse ways conversations between patients and their providers unfold. In particular, I‘m interested in the “patient-centeredness” of conversations. Did the provider demonstrate empathy? Was the patient treated like a unique person? Did the patient and provider collaboratively develop a personalized care plan?\\nI’ve been struck by how different conversations can be, ranging from highly patient-centered and attuned to broader socio-cultural contexts to highly biomedical and focused almost exclusively on whether patients take their medications or follow other recommendations. In the latter scenario, patients are not asked about their unique contexts. Thus, care plans are unlikely to match their lives, reducing the likelihood recommendations are followed.\\nIn our recent work examining conversations between patients and their providers, we noticed variation across eight HIV clinics. The clinics fell into two types: “socio-culturally attuned” or “individually responsible.” At socio-culturally attuned clinics, providers thought about patients’ contexts. We heard a provider talk with a patient with HIV about strategies to conceive, a potentially sensitive topic. Another provider asked about a patient’s gambling. And still others were attuned to patients’ challenges getting to medical appointments because of unreliable transportation or unstable housing.\\nOne provider asked a patient about taking his medications by saying, “I know you’re a good guy, so no problems with your meds?”\\nIn contrast, at the individually responsible clinics, we observed providers effectively stop patients from talking about their health or their lives. These providers focused the conversations on whether patients took their medications. One provider asked a patient about taking his medications by saying, “I know you’re a good guy, so no problems with your meds?” This left the patient with only one answer. Good patients (and good people) take their medications. A provider at another clinic asked a patient if he was “behaving,” implying that good patients are like good children and do what they are told. They take their medication.\\nNotably, we saw consistency within each clinic, indicative of the clinic’s overall culture. In the clinics where we observed socio-culturally oriented appointments, we heard about patients’ housing, transportation and relationships, across our interview and observation data. At the clinics where we observed appointments focused on medication adherence and little or no conversation about patients’ lives, we found a broader culture in which providers perceived their patients as individually responsible for their health behaviors. In our interviews with these providers, we heard them describe patients who were perceived of as not taking their medications as “flakes” or “disasters.” These patients were seen as personally culpable and morally fallible. This perspective can prevent further conversations about how to plan care and diminishes the important role patients can and should play.\\nIn the clinics where patients were seen as individually responsible for their health, providers’ judgmental approaches may be a defense mechanism to stave off uncomfortable conversations.\\nMost importantly, we found a relationship between the clinic culture and the composition of the care team. Clinics that included social workers and mental health providers—professions commonly attuned to patients’ non-biomedical needs—were more attuned to patients’ life contexts. In the clinics where providers functioned independently, with limited access to social workers or mental health providers, patients were perceived as either good or bad individuals based on their abilities to adhere to their medications.\\nIn the clinics where patients were seen as individually responsible for their health, providers’ judgmental approaches may be a defense mechanism to stave off uncomfortable conversations. If you hear a patient has problems with housing, relationships, or substance use, but feel ill-equipped to address these challenges, having this conversation may simply raise a sense of inadequacy or powerlessness.\\nIt would have been easy, as researchers, to document the judgmental language we heard and conclude that these were “bad” providers. However, our ethnographic approach allowed us to instead think about the culture of HIV care. Just as it is critical for providers to recognize and address challenges patients face in their daily lives, we need to think about providers in the context within which they work. If we want providers to have more patient-centered conversations with their patients, we need to provide them with resources to which they can refer patients when life challenges inevitably arise.',\n",
       " 'In the area of oral health, traditional dentistry is evolving to allow for a more all-encompassing approach that covers more than merely treating symptoms. This blog is your resource for learning about the aspects of holistic dentistry that go beyond traditional techniques if you’ve ever wondered what to anticipate from a holistic dentist. Let’s explore the different facets that contribute to holistic dentistry’s distinctive and patient-centered methodology.\\nUnderstanding Holistic Dentistry\\nHolistic dentistry, also known as biocompatible or unconventional dentistry, is a philosophy that views oral health as an integral part of overall well-being. Unlike traditional dentistry, which often focuses solely on treating symptoms, holistic dental care considers the whole person. It emphasizes prevention over intervention, aiming to address the root causes of your dental issues.\\nIn a holistic dental approach, the mouth is seen as a reflection of the body’s overall health. The interconnectedness of oral health with factors like nutrition, stress, and lifestyle is carefully examined. Patients can expect personalized care, incorporating natural and minimally invasive treatments, fostering a proactive attitude towards oral health.\\nHolistic dentistry goes beyond the drill-and-fill mentality, prioritizing patient education, prevention, and a deeper understanding of the mind-body connection. It’s a commitment to not only preserving a vibrant smile but enhancing the overall quality of life.\\nKeep reading to understand how visiting a holistic dentist can help you uncover a diverse range of dental care. Let’s discuss some of the top treatments you and your loved ones can expect from these dental practitioners.\\nPrevention Dentistry: Nurturing Oral Wellness from the Root\\nHolistic dentistry places a strong emphasis on preventive measures, acknowledging the profound connection between oral health and overall well-being. Unlike conventional dentistry, which often focuses on treating dental issues reactively, holistic dentists work proactively to educate patients on maintaining optimal oral health.\\nFrom personalized oral hygiene routines to dietary recommendations that support dental health, prevention dentistry in a holistic setting aims to empower patients with the knowledge and tools to safeguard their smiles.\\nEmergency Dental: Immediate Care with a Holistic Touch\\nWhen dental emergencies strike, biocompatible dentistry offers immediate care with a unique emphasis on patient well-being. Holistic emergency dental services are designed to address urgent concerns promptly, providing relief while aligning with the principles of holistic care.\\nHolistic dentists approach emergencies with a commitment to minimizing discomfort through natural remedies and techniques. From sudden toothaches to chipped teeth, these professionals prioritize both short-term relief and long-term oral health.\\nUtilizing minimally invasive procedures and avoiding harmful substances, holistic emergency dental care ensures that patients receive effective treatment without compromising their overall well-being. This holistic touch extends beyond immediate solutions, aiming to identify and address the root causes of emergencies, promoting sustained oral health and harmony in the long run. In times of dental crises, holistic dentistry stands out by combining swift, effective interventions with a commitment to the holistic principles that underpin this patient-centric approach.\\nChildren’s Dentistry: Nurturing Healthy Smiles from the Start\\nHolistic dentistry extends its principles to cater to the unique needs of young patients. Children’s dentistry in a holistic setting is not just about treating dental issues but fostering a positive attitude towards oral health from an early age.\\nEngaging and interactive sessions help children understand the importance of proper oral care, and treatments are designed to be gentle, minimally invasive, and free from harmful substances, creating a foundation for a lifetime of healthy smiles.\\nMyo Therapy: Beyond Teeth – Addressing Muscular and Facial Harmony\\nHolistic dentistry recognizes the intricate relationship between oral health and the overall musculoskeletal system. Myo therapy, short for myofunctional therapy, focuses on addressing imbalances in facial muscles and oral structures.\\nBy promoting proper muscle function and coordination, myo therapy contributes not only to enhanced oral health but also to a harmonious facial appearance, illustrating the holistic approach’s broader impact on the body.\\nLaser Dentistry: Precision and Comfort in Treatment\\nHolistic dentistry embraces technological advancements like laser dentistry to provide precise and comfortable treatments. Laser procedures offer numerous benefits, including reduced pain, faster healing, and minimized trauma to surrounding tissues. From cavity treatment to gum surgeries, laser dentistry aligns with holistic principles by prioritizing patient comfort and overall well-being throughout various dental procedures.\\n“Holistic dentistry is not a new concept but with an ancient past from the year 1800.

A Literature Review on Holistic Dentistry. Journal of Oral Health & Community Dentistry, 12(3)\\nHomeoblock Appliance: A Holistic Approach to Orthodontics\\nHolistic dentistry even extends its principles to orthodontics with the Homeoblock appliance. Unlike traditional orthodontic methods, the Homeoblock appliance aims to not only straighten teeth but also enhance overall facial balance and harmony.\\nThis innovative approach to orthodontics aligns with the holistic philosophy of treating the individual as a whole, recognizing the interconnectedness of oral health and the broader aspects of well-being.\\nAppointment Types: Tailored Experiences for Individual Needs\\nBiocompatible dentistry takes a personalized approach to appointments, recognizing that each patient has unique needs and concerns. Here’s a closer look at some of the specialized appointments offered by holistic dentists:\\nProblem-Focused Dental Exams: Holistic dentists go beyond routine check-ups by offering problem-focused dental exams. Whether you’re experiencing specific discomfort or have a particular concern, these appointments delve deep into the root cause. Through comprehensive examinations, holistic dentists identify issues at their early stages, allowing for targeted and effective interventions.\\nComplete Holistic Exam of Mouth-to-Body Link: In a holistic dental setting, the mouth is viewed as a gateway to overall health. Complete holistic exams explore the intricate connection between oral health and the well-being of the entire body. This thorough examination considers factors such as nutrition, stress, and lifestyle, providing a holistic understanding of how oral health impacts overall wellness.\\nAdditional Services Requested by Patients: Holistic dentists acknowledge that patients may seek additional services beyond conventional dental care. Whether it’s exploring alternative therapies, nutritional counseling, or incorporating mindfulness techniques into dental practices, holistic dentists are open to integrating complementary services that align with patients’ preferences and contribute to their overall health.\\nA visit to a holistic dentist promises more than just routine dental care. It encompasses a proactive and personalized approach to oral health, embracing a broader perspective that considers the interconnectedness of oral health with overall well-being.

But being the face of that franchise will always be his legacy — and he’s earned every bit of it.\\nIn the story of his career, Bryant’s time as a Colorado Rockie will probably earn a paragraph in the afterword, and no seven-year, $182 million contract will change that.\\nBesides, the face of an MLB team needs to be on the field more than 122 games in two seasons; he needs to hit more than 15 home runs; and he has to be visible to fans. Because of injuries, that hasn’t happened since Bryant signed with the Rockies.\\nBud Black has told reporters that Bryant is a key clubhouse presence. That’s good because young teams, like the Rockies, need guidance, and Bryant brings unique experience.\\nStill, being a good clubhouse guy doesn’t matter when it comes to being the face of a franchise since the job is inherently public-facing. In addition to the injuries, perhaps being that guy just isn’t who Kris Bryant is. That’s okay, too. None of this diminishes his on-field skills or accomplishments.\\nLook, the Rockies haven’t had a true face of the franchise since Nolan Arenado forced his way out of Colorado.\\nBut in November 2022, that changed because, it turns out, when Bill Schmidt traded Juan Brito to the Cleveland Guardians, in return, he got more than a lefty power bat with some speed.\\nThe Rockies announced today that they have acquired INF/OF Nolan Jones from the Cleveland Guardians in exchange for Minor League INF Juan Brito.— Rockies Club Information (@RockiesClubInfo) November 16, 2022\\nColorado currently has 39 players on the 40-man roster.\\nIn Nolan Jones, he got all that plus some intangibles no one saw coming. Schmidt found the new face of the franchise.\\nIt’s a job that requires more than athletic skill; it also involves personality. On both fronts, Jones has not disappointed.\\nHe’s a terrific baseball player\\nThe face of any sports franchise, first, needs to be an exceptional player, and Jones has established he can play. I’m not going to delve into the numbers (because Skyler Timmins will do that in “Ranking the Rockies”), but it’s worth pointing out that Jones is MLB’s first rookie to hit 20 home runs, steal 20 bases, and earn 19 outfield assists. He’s probably going to receive some Rookie of the Year votes, too.\\nOur guy Nolan is the NL Player of the Week! pic.twitter.com/tJIceVQQkM— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) October 2, 2023\\nHe has personality\\nThis part of his game emerged throughout the season.\\nFor example, ESPN doesn’t just mic up any baseball player for Sunday Night Baseball. But when the Rockies played the San Francisco Giants, they chose to visit with Nolan Jones.\\nThe broadcasters asked about his vantage from the outfield, to which Jones, honest to a fault, held up his glove to shield his eyes and confessed, “Guys, I cannot see a thing.” He had hot takes about football (“Birds are winning the Super Bowl this year”); Charlie Blackmon (“If Chuck wants it, he can have it”): his favorite Philadelphia athlete (Bryce Harper); and his family.\\nHe has charisma and humor, both key characteristics for any face of a franchise.\\nIt feels like he belongs to Rockies fans\\nGiven that Jones came through the Guardians’ system, he’s not truly “homegrown,” but it quickly came to feel like he’d been a Rockie from the start — albeit with some gap years.\\nIt helps that he’d been on the Rockies’ radar for awhile. Back in November, general manager Bill Schmidt told Patrick Saunders, “We liked him when he came out of high school and he’s a good athlete with some power.”\\nMoreover, he wants to be here, though he didn’t always feel that way.\\n“To be honest with you, the first day, it was horrible. It was horrible the first day,” Jones said to Rob Bradford’s “Baseball Isn’t Boring” podcast when describing his feelings about being traded. “I was devastated. I played for seven years and became best friends with all the guys I came up through the system with. I was actually on vacation and it ruined my whole day. I was really upset and then I looked at it as a new opportunity.”\\nIt helped that he found a warm welcome in Arizona from Ryan McMahon, Brian Serven, and Randal Grichuk.\\n“There was a bunch of guys and I remember calling my dad on the way home and I was like ‘This is going to be the best thing that ever happened to me,’” he recalled. “I got to meet a whole new group of people. It was scary for me at first, I didn’t know what to expect, but everything about it has been awesome.”\\nHe’s relatable — and he can’t stop himself from being honest\\nJones always seems so straightforward.\\nTake this passage from an August 2023 story by Thomas Harding, back when folks were beginning to understand Jones’ talent:\\n“In 2016 I was drafted by [Cleveland], and I got to watch a Rookie of the Year, KB, go win a World Series [with the Cubs],” Jones said. “I told him — I probably shouldn’t have — but I had a picture of him in my room. He was playing third base at the time. He was a superstar. I wanted to be like Kris Bryant.”\\nFocus on that line when Jones confesses, “I told him — I probably shouldn’t have.” He realizes that he should probably be cool and act like it’s no big deal, being on the same team as his childhood idol. But he can’t help himself: He has to say this to Bryant, even though he risks looking foolish doing it.\\nAnd then he can’t keep from telling this potentially embarrassing story to Thomas Harding and, by extension, the world.\\nAll of this suggests to fans that they’ve got the real deal, not a marketing construct.\\nAnd that matters when someone is the face of a franchise.\\nHe has leadership\\nLeadership is hard to measure, but you can see it in Jones’ interactions with his teammates.\\nWhen the rookies were going to Starbucks in Chicago to get coffee for the vets, Jones led the procession. When the camera focused on the Rockies’ bench because of a big moment, he was leading the cheers for his teammates. When Elehuris Montero hit a walk-off single, Jones was the first person to get the party started. When praised for his improving outfield defense, he routinely deferred to Brenton Doyle and credited Ezequiel Tovar for being a role model.\\nAnd when you saw him at batting practice, he was usually wearing a Justin Lawrence “CAUTION: WATCH FOR SWEEPERS” t-shirt. Maybe he’s just a fan of BreakingT, but he was probably supporting a teammate.\\nJones has that in spades.\\nHe’s had a great story since arriving in Colorado\\nThink about it.\\nIn addition to having a breakout rookie season (and if it weren’t for Corbin Carroll, Jones would be in the thick of the ROY discussion), KB, his childhood idol, offered him a challenge: If Nolan Jones could hit 20 homers or get 60 RBI, Bryant would give him a Rolex.\\nThen Jones worked hard and met the goal.\\nSeriously, you can’t script a Hallmark movie like this.\\nLook for this to be Nolan Jones’ signature move going forward.\\nIn a miserable 2023, Rockies fans had a glimpse of the future.\\nI don’t know why Rockies fans have a thing for guys named “Nolan.” They just do.\\nBe of good cheer, Rockies fans. Nolan 2.0 has arrived.\\nGoodman had a wide-ranging conversation with Nolan Jones when the rookie was en route to Scottsdale for the offseason — and it’s a two part conversation. There’s much for Rockies fans to absorb here. But if nothing else, listen to Part II to get the details of not playing during the Seattle Mariners series, that Kris-Bryant-gifted Rolex, and learning to throw again in 2019.\\nTrevor May is one of my favorite baseball players, in part because he does such a good job of using social media to explain baseball to fans.\\nLast week during the NLDS, he took to X/Twitter to outline what goes into approaching a batter — and it’s a lot.\\nHow I would prepare to face Bryce Harper tonight, a thread...— Trevor May (@IamTrevorMay) October 13, 2023\\nOn a different note, yesterday, May opened up on his thoughts about selling the Oakland Athletics, and it’s perfect (WARNING: Profanity):\\nTrevor, even though you’ve retired, please keep sharing your insights.\\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

       " 'Numerically Aided Phenomenology: Procedures for Investigating Categories of Experience\\nKeywords:phenomenology, quantification, classification, reading experience\\nAbstractComplementarity between quantitative and qualitative methods often implies that qualitative methods are a step toward quantitative precision or that quantitative and qualitative methods provide mutually validating \"triangulation.\" However, there also is unacknowledged quantification within the type of analytic induction that is considered pivotal in qualitative thinking. We attempt to justify this claim and present a form of phenomenological analysis that invokes numeric algorithms. Numerically aided phenomenology is a procedure for systematically describing categories (kinds, or types) of lived experience within a set of experiential narratives. In a comparative reading, recurrent meaning expressions are identified and paraphrased. Then judgments about their presence or absence are used to create matrices representing the profiles of meanings expressed in each narrative. Finally, cluster analytic algorithms are used to group these experiential narratives according to the similarities in their profiles of meaning expressions. In this way, categories of similar experiential narratives—and their distinctive attributes—can be identified. Rather than an essentialist conception of the qualities defining classes, in numerically aided phenomenology classes are defined by more-or-less invariant attributes, i.e., classes are formed such that members share a large number of expressed meanings, although no single meaning (or set thereof) is necessary or sufficient for class membership.

       " 'Initiating a run\\nRunning your algorithm on one of the available backends is initiated by clicking on the\\nRUN button at the top right of the screen. A popup window will appear that shows you:\\n- The backend that has been selected for this experiment\\n- The number of qubits used in this experiment\\n- The name of the current experiment (can be changed by the user)\\n- The number of shots of this experiment (can be changed by the user)\\n- Information whether simulation optimization will be used or not (only for emulator backends)\\nExecuting algorithms on a hardware backend\\nWhen you run a quantum algorithm on a hardware backend the list of quantum operations is limited by the set of operations that is supported by the backend and the topology of the chip. The list of allowed operations for the current backends can be found here.\\nFor hardware backends, the number of qubits in your algorithm must always be set equal to the number of qubits on the chip, although you do not need to perform operations on all qubits.\\nWhen you do not provide any\\nprep statements for your algorithm, all qubits will be initialized in the ground state or |0> state in the z-basis.\\nWhen you do not put any\\nmeasure statements at the end of your algorithm, by default all qubits will be measured in the z-direction. When you do close your algorithm with a measurement on one or more qubits, only those qubits will be measured and the result for non-measured qubits will be set to the default value of zero.\\nIn most cases you will have to execute multiple shots in order to get some statistics on your measurement and to reduce the effects of decoherence, leakage, and control imperfections. On a hardware backend, when you execute N shots of your algorithm, all shots will be executed in succession. For each shot, the final measurements will be stored in the binary register and written to the raw data file, see displaying and downloading your results. The histogram will show the probability distribution of each state of the binary register.\\nExecuting algorithms on a emulator backend\\nQuantum Inspire provides different emulator backends, depending on your needs and on your account privileges. Make sure you select the backend which best fits the requirements of your algorithm in order to optimize overall execution time.\\nWhen you execute your algorithm on an emulator backend it is usually unnecessary to execute multiple shots of the same algorithm. In this case Quantum Inspire will use simulation optimization to produce the results more quickly. This can only be done when there are no measurement instructions in your algorithm and no error model is used. Please refer to the section on simulation optimization to understand the difference between deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms, when optimization will be applied, how you can influence this decision, and what the number of shots implies for these situations.\\nTo understand how simulation optimization works with the SDK, experienced users should refer to the Advanced user guide.\\nSelecting the number of shots\\nWhen no simulation optimization can be used the algorithm will be executed N times. When simulation optimization is used, no randomization will be applied when N=1. In all other cases randomization with N virtual shots will be applied.\\nWhen a simulation is put in the queue of a backend, a copy of the current code of the algorithm is stored with the result of the execution. This way you can compare different versions of your project quickly (e.g. with error model and without error model). More on this in managing your projects.',\n",

       " 'Before settling and starting a family, the first thing people do is check the most suitable places to raise their families in. Some of the biggest concerns before settling include security, education institutions, amenities, hospitals, and recreational centers. Basically, an affordable, decent place with everything within reach. The US is one of the most sought-after countries to raise families in, and whether you are moving from a different country or simply want to relocate to another city within the country, there are endless options you can choose from. Read on to see some of the most family-friendly cities in the USA.\\nArlington is strategically located, neighboring a few of the biggest employers in the country. It has a population of about 229, 534 with schools ranking 25% higher on average than those in other parts of the country. And if you want your kids to get their higher education from there, there are four universities you could choose from. The median home price is $729,477 and it is one of the safest cities to be in, with a crime rate lower than the national average by a whopping 61%. Apart from the usual outdoor activities, there are tourist activities you could take part in: It is even pet-friendly with five city-owned dog parks! So it’s an ideal place for the whole family!\\nIn the northwest corner of Broward County is where you find Parkland which is populated by about 32,000 people. When it comes to education, there are 5 public schools where your kids can get a quality education. And depending on the neighborhood you wish to move to, there are a few things to consider. For instance, would you choose neighborhoods with very close proximity to amenities, somewhere you can simply walk to? Also, is close proximity to shopping areas and restaurants that important to you. Or yet, would you prefer quiet to busy areas with bursting energy? In Parkland, you will find endless opportunities, and talking about safety, the crime rate is quite low.\\n“Most families we work with all ask about Parkland, and those that can afford it, end up living there. It’s really got family appeal and the fact that most families view it as a destination, will only work to serve that appeal” says Mack Dudayev, founder of Chance Realty.\\nWith a median home price of $390,914 and a population of 146,431, Naperville has been considered one of the best cities in not only Illinois but the whole of the country to live in. Indian Prairie High School in Naperville was ranked by Chicago Tribune as the best in the US in 2015 and in addition, there were other well-ranked schools on the list. Its neighborhoods are safe and there is a variety of family-friendly activities to enjoy in the city. What’s more, the population in Naperville is quite diversified with a bigger percentage of locals well-educated.\\nColumbia is a perfect family-friendly location situated in the Baltimore-Washington metro area. It is a planned community with schools ranking high within the state and the whole of the country, as well as a number of libraries in the city. Regardless of the village you choose to live in, there are recreational centers in all of them with fitness centers and swimming pools. Also, there are kids’ playgrounds lakes, and hike trails, so outdoor fun is not limited. Back in 2018, Columbia was crowned the title ‘the safest city in America’ and with a median home price of $363,388, it is definitely a family-friendly city.\\nThe Woodlands, TX\\nThe Woodlands is made up of different planned neighborhoods in the suburban parts of Houston, TX. From great schools to grocery stores, golf courses, and office parks, the city is such a pleasant location to raise a family in. On top of that, there are both public and private schools, with 18 elementary schools and a community college. The city has a population of 109,608 and a median home price of $351,000. There are also family activities you can indulge in, some of which help promote a sense of community for the locals. Crime rates are also low, so most of the neighborhoods here are safe.\\nBellevue is not only a family-friendly city but one with an illustrious job market recognized country-wide. It is neighbored by headquarters to some of the biggest companies and has been named the sixth position in the list of the healthiest cities in America. These are some of the reasons why a lot of young professionals and families are drawn to settling in Bellevue. It has a population of $139,014 and a median home price of $729,381. While it has been known to have low crime rates, its police have been ranked among the top when compared to other cities in the state. Parks here have different amenities, and there are more indoor and outdoor activities for every family member.\\nBowling Green, OH\\nWhen it comes to family fun, you’d want to think about parks, lively events, and camps, just to mention a few. Bowling Green is loaded with such facilities and more. The best part is that the cost of living is very affordable, with the median listing price being $160,000. So even if you want a large family, it would not be as hard to attain the financial stability you want and provide for them. If you and your spouse would like to enjoy the nightlife in Bowling Green, there are no limitations, from restaurants to bars, cafes, and nightlife spots. If you prefer daytime outdoor activities for the whole of the family, there is kayaking, fishing, yoga, hiking, and cycling that you can enjoy in different spots around the city.\\nThe location you choose to raise a family in is as important as the home. Choosing a location without information about it such as security, affordability, schools, social amenities, hospitals, recreational facilities, the infrastructure, and everything in between could cost you more than you think in the long run. What is your income and what costs will you incur in that city? Will you need to rearrange your budget in order to afford your new home and support your family? Generally, will there be drastic changes and how well will your loved ones take to settle in the new location. There is just so much that goes into it, but with a good plan and prior research to the move, you should have little to no stress.',\n",

However, it is important to set a budget for yourself before you start playing and stick to it.\\nPenny slots are a variation of regular slot games and they offer a lower maximum bet per spin. They are typically free to play, although some do require a minimum amount of lines that must be activated for each spin.\\nWhen playing penny slots, you need to keep in mind that the chances of winning big are very small. Whether you’re playing online or in a land-based casino, make sure to manage your bankroll wisely and limit your losses.\\nIf you’re a beginner, you might want to start with low-limit games and increase your bet size as you get more experience. This will help you avoid a gambling addiction and will allow you to win more money in the long run.\\nChoosing the Right Penny Slots for You\\nThere are several types of slots on the market, but one of the most popular is the penny slot. These games allow you to bet as little as a penny per spin, but have evolved over the years to allow for a higher maximum bet.\\nTraditionally, slot machines used mechanical reels and had about 22 symbols on each. This limited the number of possible combinations and the jackpots they could pay.\\nBut modern slot machines use microprocessors and have multiple reels, which means they have a much larger number of possible combinations. In the past, these machines had a few hundred possible outcomes, but today they can have upwards of ten thousand.\\nThe slot receiver is an extremely versatile position that requires a lot of different skills. They need to be able to run routes that can confuse the defense, and they need to be able to block. This is because they are positioned closer to the center of the field, where they will be more vulnerable to hits.\\nThey are also a key part of a team’s blocking scheme, and they need to be able to protect their running back. They will often pick up blitzes from the linebackers and secondary players, but they are also very important on outside runs, where they give the running back more space to get free.\\nUnlike other receivers, slot receivers need to be extra speedy and have excellent route-running skills. They are often able to outrun their opponents and catch the ball, but they need to be able to make a quick and accurate read on passing plays as well.',\n",

       " 'In the wake of last Saturday’s enormous Palestine solidarity march, Conor Reddy assesses the growth of movement, the challenges it faces and the strategies we need to bring about full Palestinian liberation.\\nSaturday’s march for Palestine in Dublin was enormous. Perhaps the biggest seen since the peak of the water charges movement almost a decade ago. Between 70 to 100,000 people took to the streets demanding action to stop the genocide in Gaza and to hold the Zionist state to account for its crimes. The march marks a high point for a movement that has been mobilising consistently at local and national levels since Israel’s offensive began after October 7th and demonstrates the depth of Irish solidarity with Palestine in spite of Irish Government inaction, British and EU complicity and the conservatism of sections of the broad left at times.\\nIt is entirely appropriate that such large numbers demonstrated when they did. Atrocities continue unabated in Gaza as the effects of destruction so far visited upon the Strip amplify horror and tragedy. At this point, Occupation forces have dropped over 65,000 tonnes of bombs on Gaza killing over 24,000 people (including 10,000 children) and maiming tens of thousands more. 33% of all buildings in the strip have been destroyed. Entire residential neighbourhoods have been levelled. Critical infrastructure including hospitals, sanitation facilities and schools have been demolished. And now, the spectre of famine haunts those who remain as the Occupation tightly controls the passage of aid into Gaza, using hunger as a weapon of war. According to the U.N. one in four people are now starving and nine out of ten families in some areas go a day and night without eating. Over 60,000 people are wounded and Gaza’s medical system has been almost completely destroyed. Only a third of Gaza’s hospitals are in any way functional. Only six ambulances are still functioning – for a population of over 2.4 million. At this stage of Israel’s genocidal campaign, hunger and disease could very well claim more lives than bombs, bullets or shells if it is allowed to continue.\\nFacing this dark vista, South Africa acted as the conscience of the world, launching their Genocide Convention case against the Zionist state at the International Court of Justice in the week before Saturday’s protests. Irish lawyer, Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, who is part of the prosecution, was celebrated internationally and seen locally as more representative than any figure in the Irish Government. Leo Varadkar’s remarks on the case were particularly shameful. Refusing to offer state support for the prosecution, he drew equivalence between Israel’s genocide and the events of October 7th before questioning the appropriateness of levelling charges of genocide against Israel given the Jewish experience of genocide in the Holocaust.\\nMore subdued but equally shameful was Mícheál Martin’s suggestion that those calling for Ireland to join the case were trying to “create division”. For his part, Transport Minister and Green Party leader, Eamon Ryan, said there were “irrefutable” points in the genocide case, but refused to be drawn on the question of Irish support because, “The court case is one standing effectively first between South Africa and Israel”. If you’ve been wondering what it might take for the Green Party to take down the Government, don’t hold your breath now.\\nDespite government opposition to joining the ICJ case, the first days of hearings spurred on the movement and will now become a key focus here in Ireland and around the world. This was evident on Saturday in speeches and chanting but it must go much further.\\nShifting the Terrain\\nWhile Saturday marked a high point for the movement, it is far from the only success we have had to date. In the weeks after October 7th, Varadkar and Martin were both vocal in condemnation of Palestinian resistance and staunch in their support of “Israel’s right to self defence”. Martin, in particular, was ridiculed when he travelled to Occupied Palestine in November, posing in a house supposedly hit by a “Hamas Rocket” while the local regime gave him a guided tour. Since these early days, Varadkar, Martin and the Government have been forced rhetorically to the left, abandoning their earlier defence of Israel and making comments that have drawn ire in the Zionist state, to the point that the Irish ambassador was summoned for a dressing down by Israeli officials in December. Now, they are under serious pressure as they cling to their line that they support a ceasefire – while doing nothing to bring it about. All of this is happening in the context of a serious push by the Government to do away with Irish neutrality and row in behind NATO. But now we are a far cry away from the stage-managed consultative forums the Government ran last June – the credibility of the US-led NATO and EU PESCO forces has been obliterated by US, British and EU support for Zionism.\\nA harder won victory for the movement came when Sinn Féin was forced into changing its position on the expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador (for a second time, back to its historically held support for expulsion). Sinn Féin’s initial refusal to support expulsion (and full-throated condemnations of Hamas) was met with confusion, shock and then anger. Large sections of Sinn Féin’s base could not accept such a sharp turn from a position that the party had strongly endorsed just two years prior, in 2021. Pressure mounted on local reps ahead of important votes on support for expulsion on councils in Belfast, Derry and elsewhere but the party forced abstentions, meaning the narrow defeat of a Pro-Palestine motion in Belfast. Arguments raged online and in SF strongholds in response to these votes, with SF public reps and the well-known Felons’ Club jumping into the fray on opposite sides of the argument. Days later, Sinn Féin correctly made a U-turn with a statement calling the position of the Ambassador to the South “untenable”. Mary Lou McDonald asserted that this decision had nothing to do with a fear of being outflanked, but this is hard to believe, given that she had been arguing the opposite position with people online only the day before her statement.\\nThe victory for the movement highlights the need for concrete political demands that can be put on the Government to shame them into taking action. The result of Sinn Féin’s initial fence-sitting was that the Government had six weeks at the beginning of the war on Gaza where they had cover to hide behind nebulous calls of ceasefire without action.\\nToday, as the whole world, with the notable exception of Israel, the United States and its vassals support the call for a ceasefire. The question is, how do we achieve one? Who will bring it about? In this context, calls for the expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador (particularly in “the West”) and for sanctions on Israel must be at the forefront of our demands. Likewise, we must keep the pressure on Ireland to support South Africa’s case at the ICJ.\\nWhite House Visit\\nThe St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House is emerging as another key pressure point for the movement in Ireland. Biden’s paddy-whackery and self-professed “Irishness”, combined with his militant support for Israel and denial of atrocities make the visit an important target for protest. Without his political assent and billions in financial support, Israel’s campaign would have ended long ago. Varadkar, Martin and the forelock-tugging gombeens of the Irish establishment see their “special relationship” with the US as sacrosanct, critical to their economic model which is reliant on “investment” from US companies and funds. This in part explains their desire for Ireland to draw closer to NATO and US leadership. In these circumstances, where the US President is a direct accomplice to genocide, however, they are politically vulnerable and there is an opening to attack, by demanding they boycott the visit.\\nA boycott would be a propaganda coup over US imperialism, much more than a gesture or a moral victory. Snubbing Biden in an election year and the US in general would reverberate globally, further undermining American imperialism and potentially inspiring others to take aim at Israel’s most loyal patron. In addition to $3.8 billion of military aid the US gives to Israel annually, Biden bypassed congress to provide another $14.5 billion in military aid in November. Since he was first elected, Biden has been among the most rabid supporters of Zionism in American politics. Now he risks a catastrophic regional war, having authorised military strikes on Yemen without congressional approval after the Yemeni blockade on Red Sea shipping to and from the Zionist entity.\\nFor peace and justice to reign in Palestine and across the Middle East, Biden must be tackled as hard as Netanyahu and the Zionists – he too should stand before the Hague. Anyone who shakes hands with him in the White House on St Patrick’s Day will struggle to wipe the blood from their own hands afterwards. Saturday’s march made their feelings on this very clear, with chants of “No shamrocks for Genocide Joe”. Bernadette McAliskey got a huge response from the crowd when she said:\\n“Weigh up the corpses of Gaza and a jolly to the US. Nobody here should give a single vote to anyone whose backside is in Washington.”\\nWe have two months to pile the pressure on Leo Varadkar and the Irish Government not to go to the White House. Once again, Sinn Féin also need to be pressured on this – the last we heard from Mary Lou McDonald on this was that she was not in favour of a St Patrick’s Day boycott. We’ve shamed her into doing the right thing once – we can do it again as a movement.\\nAs well as pushing for a White House boycott, the use of Shannon Airport by the US military must be hauled back onto the agenda. Particularly now as the US increases its aggression in the Middle East with air strikes on Yemen and the threat of further aggression in the wider region, the Irish state is once again complicit in the war crimes of US imperialism.\\nBuilding a Movement for Palestinian Liberation\\nWhile the immediate task here and around the globe is to build forces sufficient to stop the slaughter of Gaza, a larger task now looms. The question of “the day after” and what follows such a shocking series of crimes is growing in importance and the numbers of people asking deeper questions about the oppression of Palestinians has grown exponentially. The Palestinian struggle has reached a turning point, one it has been approaching for years, driven forward by the dialectic between the arrival of End Stage Zionism (the total elimination of Palestine and Palestinian national ambitions) and the changing dynamics of Palestinian resistance that led to October 7th. Nothing in Palestine can ever be the same, there is no returning to the pre-October 7th reality and there is no hope that the West could impose a “two-state” scenario that would be supported or sustained for any length of time. In this moment our task becomes to sustain the movement for an end to genocide but also to deepen its politics and channel its energy in support of Palestinian liberation.\\nHow do we do this? Mass mobilisation has been and will continue to be hugely important, in forcing demands on government, but also in consolidating the enthusiastic support of tens of thousands of Irish people. Socialists must continue to push for large scale national and regional marches, and to work with others in this task. Mass platforms, as Bernadette McAliskey showed last Saturday, open the way to mass support for radical demands.\\nDirect action has also helped to keep the momentum up over the past few months, particularly across the few (strictly relative) lulls we have seen since October. This must continue. Action for Palestine Ireland, Saoirse don Phalaistín and Dublin for Gaza have all at various times sustained the movement and sharpened its focus. Occupations at the Zionist Embassy, blockades of bridges, a dinner at the US Ambassador’s residence and dynamic BDS-themed moving protests have focused minds across the broader movement on important political and economic targets.\\nThis has also allowed for a concentration of militants, where politics is discussed, developed and deepened. To date, direct actions have not veered towards small-group clandestine action, which in other instances has proven counterproductive, intensifying state repression on activists and shifting focus away from mass participation.\\nAnother important tactic has been the boycott. Many people are boycotting key Israeli-linked businesses on an individual level, which has some effect, but the most effective strategy is to build a collective campaign in the community to pressurise local shops and businesses from stocking Israeli goods in the first place. There have been a number of successful examples of this kind of campaigning. For example, in Derry activists mobilised on a grassroots level and were successful in pressuring O’Neill’s into removing Puma products from their stores and in forcing the local branch of Home Bargains to remove Israeli goods they stocked. Going back to 2014, Kinvara in Galway was the first place in Ireland to become completely free of Israeli goods. This can be done elsewhere by petitioning local people and then campaigning against any shops that stock Israeli goods. Local solidarity groups and political activists should band together and make this a focus of their activity outside of demonstrating and mobilising together for marches.\\nAs local campaigns grow, pressure should also be brought to bear on councils to end contracts with companies on the Global BDS list, especially HP, who have contracts for printers and computer equipment with local authorities North and South. In the run up to Local Elections in the South, Left candidates should commit to making their wards “Apartheid Free Zones” and to advancing positive solidarity initiatives, twinning with Palestinian towns and villages, flying the Palestinian flag, engaging in cultural and economic exchanges.\\nOutside of protest, boycotts and direct action, one of the most striking elements of this movement has been its cultural wing. While in other Western countries, many artists and musicians have either shamelessly backed Israel or remained silent, there has been a wave of support from those in Ireland. Thousands attended the Gig for Gaza at the 3 Arena back in November, after the gig was moved from Vicar Street due to popular demand. Countless other solidarity gigs have taken place across the island.\\nAll of this is overwhelmingly positive, but there are a few things to say about it. Firstly, we should approach these events as acts of solidarity and not charity. There has been, in any case, a basic problem with fundraising since the beginning – very little aid is being allowed into Gaza. What is primarily required, therefore, is not a charitable solution, but a political one. There was outrage, for example, at Green Party TD Patrick Costello when he put on a fundraiser to raise money for Medical Aid to Palestine, after voting against expelling the Israeli Ambassador and sanctions on Israel.\\nNevertheless, these fundraisers can also be used to educate people and to inspire them to take other actions to build the movement. On the other end of the spectrum from Costello, That Social Centre in Phibsborough ran a series solidarity nights for Palestine where, as well as music and poetry, there were political speakers who could help deepen people’s understanding of what is happening, lay out a strategy, and explain to people what else they can do to build the movement.\\nArt can move peoples’ hearts and minds, but ultimately if we are to change things, we must act on that inspiration in the form of concrete political action.\\nSadly, there is one key area where we have been sorely lacking – the trade unions and our workplaces. Despite overwhelming solidarity across the population and an Irish Congress of Trade Unions mandate to stand in solidarity with Palestinians and the BDS Campaign, we have seen precious little from trade union leaders. SIPTU dropped a banner on Liberty Hall calling for “Ceasefire Now”. They were lauded in some quarters for doing this, but this is less than the bare minimum. The call for a ceasefire is in lockstep with the Government – what are they going to do to make it happen? Ireland has a proud history of trade union action to draw on when it comes to tackling Apartheid – the Dunnes Stores workers who refused to handle South African goods and created a tidal wave of support for the anti-Apartheid movement, for example. Crucially, they were supported by their union in doing so.\\nUnfortunately, we cannot expect much from trade union leadership in this regard. Therefore, the fight must be built from the ground up by rank-and-file members in their branches. We urgently need another Mary Manning moment, where workers refuse to handle Israeli goods. If and when this happens, the pressure must be put on trade union leadership to back their workers regardless of the legality of political strikes under the repressive, 1990 Industrial Relations Act. The emergence of workplace campaigns like Teachers for Palestine and the flying of union flags by activists on Saturday are a start. The movement now needs people to dedicate themselves to drawing together groups of workers across sectors to build general solidarity in their workplaces and to fight for a more active stance of solidarity as we approach union conference season.\\nIreland can be a leader in the West\\nIntensifying activity locally, in our workplaces and in the cultural sphere will root the Palestine solidarity movement more deeply, creating a vehicle capable of taking on the longer and more substantial task of supporting liberation whilst maximising pressure for an end to genocide in the short term. In this task the movement must remain connected politically, led by a united front and the voices of Palestinians in Ireland. There must be space for education and politics as well as activism. Socialists have an important role to play in this regard and should continue to host meetings and educational forums to equip greater numbers with the clarity and confidence to lead the movement on its various fronts. Campaign groups like the Irish Palestine Solidarity Campaign will be the glue that holds the movement together and should begin to expand to include workers, students and to coordinate with those taking part locally or in direct action.\\nSaturday 13th January was a high point but it must not be the highest point. With huge numbers actively standing in solidarity with Palestine now, there is every opportunity to make Ireland truly exceptional and to give a lead to others across the West. Winning a victory against the Irish establishment on behalf of Palestine and against imperialism would be a light to a universal struggle, here and around the world. Offering hope to Palestinians and indeed everyone else.',\n",

Produced and written by multi-Platinum entertainer Dierks Bentley along with co-writers Jim Beavers and Brett Beavers, the live track was recently recorded in Nashville and delivers a powerful message through lead singer Doug Douglason’s prolific lyrical musings. THE K IS SILENT is now available for pre-order here at all digital retailers and fans will instantly receive the new patriotic track.The music video for “The USA Begins With Us” is simultaneously available now, meshing together “a tongue-on-cheek rave-up of every patriotic cliché in the book” (CMT) with a message more timely than ever. Fans can watch the Knights blast of good-old-fashioned allegiance on The Chive and all digital platforms here.\\nAs the Knights continue “riding a neon wave of Nineties country nostalgia” (Rolling Stone) advocates like Saving Country Music understand “releasing this type of material into the woke world we live in today takes a pretty big moose knuckle. We’re not supposed to laugh at anything these days at the fear of someone being offended. That is what makes Hot Country Knights so timely.”\\nFamous for never giving up on the dream of the ‘90s, the Hot Country Knights “wear their inspirations on their sleeves pretty proudly” (The Chive). Comprised of band leader Douglas (“Doug”) Douglason, lead bass player Trevor Travis, lead guitarist Marty Ray (“Rayro”) Roburn, keytar/fiddle player Terotej (“Terry”) Dvoraczekynski, steel guitarist Barry Van Ricky and percussionist Monte Montgomery, the Knights have been dubbed by Variety as a “full Spinal Tap-like musical-comedy act.” Produced by Bentley, the singer/songwriter also serves as a co-writer on over half of the 10 brawny tracks.

To meet this need in our community, we have developed the Chillventa eSpecial, which will present a large part of the world’s leading exhibition for refrigeration technology in virtual form. We are looking forward to a successful event in October,” says Daniela Heinkel, Director Chillventa at NürnbergMesse.\\nWhat’s in store at the Chillventa eSpecial?\\nOn all three days of the event, the profiles of participating exhibitors from all around the world will be available to visitors on a digital platform. These profiles can contain comprehensive information on the company, its products and innovations. All exhibitor packages also contain free access to the event for an unlimited number of personnel, so sales teams can be dispatched to chase up new contacts and interesting projects. There will be a clear emphasis on direct personal discussions. During the event, exhibitor personnel will have a range of communication channels at their disposal to allow them to quickly contact relevant participants. In this context they are assisted by a sophisticated matchmaking system that suggests best matches for their requirements from among all participants in the event. Exhibitors can choose between three different packages (bronze, silver or gold) offering various benefits.\\nFor more information on the various packages, the link to register and a comprehensive FAQ section, please go to: www.chillventa.de/e-special\\nThe Chillventa eSpecial will be accompanied by the Chillventa CONGRESS on the first day and by a high-calibre programme of presentations on the second and third days.\\nChillventa CONGRESS: Tuesday 13 October\\nThe virtual version of the Chillventa CONGRESS will provide experts with comprehensive insights into topical industry issues. Internationally renowned speakers will share their knowledge from research, development and practice and provide information on current policy frameworks in Europe and worldwide.\\nThese topics will be covered in two lecture series:\\n- Heat Pumping Technologies for Commercial and Industrial Applications\\n- ASERCOM + EPEE Symposium\\n- 6th Innovation Day Refrigeration Technology\\n- Energy-efficient air conditioning of data centres\\nHub for the refrigeration, AC, ventilation and heat pump community (Wednesday and Thursday)\\nWith its extensive range of product range, the Chillventa eSpecial provides an overview of the industry with components, systems and applications for refrigeration, AC, ventilation and heat pumps. At the virtual event, these products will be presented in three parallel streams on the second and third days.\\nThere will be presentations on the latest product developments and innovative solutions for overall energy performance and energy saving. A large part of the event will also be devoted to the many different aspects of refrigerants such as non-flammable low GWP refrigerants for refrigeration and heat pump applications, sensors for leak detection, recycling and the circular economy, and the eco-efficiency model. Other topics include the reduction of refrigerant charge, semi-hermetic compressors for R717, the selection of new refrigerant oils, compressor efficiency measurements, and certification programmes.\\nEurammon will present a session on the use of R717 and R744, EVIA will cover the topic of fans, the VDMA will focus on filters and BFS will explore flammable refrigerants. The topic of heat pumps will also be covered in depth through presentations by AIT (Austrian Institute of Technology) and Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute.\\nThe VDKF will look at data security specifically for businesses in the industry and explore the conscious decision to utilise virtual tools.\\nA session on refrigeration and AC systems in the context of the coronavirus pandemic will explore this current challenge from various perspectives and present the latest insights.\\nAt the end of the three days, visitors to the virtual event will continue to have access to the presentations online.',\n",
       " 'Press Status: Not Free\\nPress Freedom Score: (0 = best, 100 = worst) 69\\nLegal Environment: (0 = best, 30 = worst) 23\\nPolitical Environment: (0 = best, 40 = worst) 30\\nEconomic Environment: (0 = best, 30 = worst) 16\\nPress freedom conditions deteriorated in 2013, placing Iraq among the most deadly countries for the media, with at least 10 journalists killed in connection with their work during the year. Reporters also suffered frequent detentions, beatings, and confiscation of equipment, as well as poor legal protections in terms of both upholding their rights and obtaining justice for violence perpetrated against them.\\nIraq\\'s constitution protects freedom of speech and expression, but vague and often overlapping laws govern the media. The 1968 Publications Law allows journalists to be imprisoned for up to seven years for insulting the government, and the 1969 Penal Code criminalizes libel and defamation. At year\\'s end, at least 10 journalists faced criminal charges for defamation under Article 314 of the penal code, which provides penalties of up to one month in prison or a fine of up to $215. In 2010, the Supreme Judicial Council created a special court to prosecute journalists, despite a ban on the creation of special courts in Article 95 of the constitution. In October 2013, the Court for Media and Publications sentenced a journalist to three days in prison for writing an article that accused government housing authorities of corruption. The 2011 Journalist Protection Law initially offered some hope of reform by safeguarding free speech, providing benefits to journalists who are killed or injured on the job, and abolishing the requirement that they belong to the journalists\\' union. While the law represented a positive step, media watchdog groups complained that it was ambiguous and narrowly defined who constituted a journalist; it also did not override sections of the penal code or the publications law that pertain to journalists. The Society for Defending Press Freedom in Iraq challenged the law, but the Federal Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 2012.\\nIn January 2013, the controversial Information Technology Crimes Bill was withdrawn from consideration by the parliament. The draft law would have included harsh punishments such as life imprisonment for using computers to adversely affect the \"unity\" of the country or its economic, political, military, or security interests. A second draft bill called the Law on Freedom of Expression, Assembly, and Peaceful Protest would, among other prohibitions, ban press statements \"inconsistent with public order or morals,\" but this bill had not been passed at year\\'s end.\\nIn the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan, the Kurdistan Press Law protects the right of journalists to obtain information \"of importance to citizens\" and \"relevant to the public interest.\" The law also requires officials to investigate incidents in which journalists are injured or killed as a result of their work. However, few journalists\\' deaths have been investigated. Public officials regularly use the region\\'s penal code to sue journalists for libel, usually for stories about corruption. According to the local advocacy group the Metro Center to Defend Journalists, hundreds of court cases are filed against journalists each year, charging them with, among other things, defamation or vaguely defined offenses such as insulting religion. In October 2013, the newspaper Awene and its former editor in chief, Shwan Mohammed, were both fined after the paper published a photograph in 2009 of a politician at a nightclub in London.\\nIraq has no national law guaranteeing access to government information, and in practice official information is difficult for journalists to obtain. The Kurdish regional government enacted a Right of Information Law in June 2013 that, although positive, left room for improvement regarding procedures for information requests and appeals.\\nThe primary body responsible for regulating broadcast media, the Communications and Media Commission (CMC), is seen to be under government control. In April 2013, the CMC suspended the licenses of 10 television channels, including Qatar-based Al-Jazeera, for \"unprofessional coverage\" amid accusations that their reporting was inciting sectarian violence. Most of the suspended stations were locally based and had ties to Sunni politicians. The suspensions were lifted in June, but the stations continued to be harassed by authorities throughout the year. In July, the CMC demanded exorbitant new licensing fees from some independent radio stations to allow them to continue broadcasting. In September, Al-Baghdadiya television had its office raided and transmitting equipment confiscated by officials, reportedly after the station aired a news segment that was critical of the Interior Ministry.\\nReporters are regularly prevented from covering sensitive stories or denied access to officials and news events. In addition, self-censorship among journalists remains widespread due to fear of reprisals in the form of deadly violence or criminal libel suits.\\nJournalists face regular threats and physical harassment from both state and nonstate actors, and Iraq had one of the world\\'s highest murder rates for journalists in 2013. The northern town of Mosul was an especially dangerous city for members of the press: In October, gunmen killed Al-Sharqiya cameraman Mohammed Ghanem and correspondent Mohammed al-Badrani while they were filming Eid al-Adha holiday preparations; also that month, gunmen shot and killed Bashar al-Nuaimi, a cameraman for Mosuliya TV. In November, two more journalists, Alaa Edwar and Bashar Najm, were shot dead in separate incidents in the city, and in December, unknown assailants gunned down journalists Nawras al-Nuaimi and Adel Muhsin Hussein in a pair of attacks. In other cities, radio journalist Muwaffak al-Ani was killed in a Baghdad explosion in May; the body of Zamil Ghanam al-Zoba\\'ie, a veteran journalist who worked for several outlets, was found in Baghdad in June; gunmen killed Wadah al-Hamdani, a television reporter in Basra, in November; and Muhanad Mohammed, a journalist for Sumariya TV, was killed in a suicide bombing in Baghdad in December. Also in December, at least five journalists were killed when suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of the Salah al-Din television station in Tikrit, north of Baghdad.\\nOther types of violence against journalists continued throughout the year. The Arab Network for Human Rights Information logged dozens of incidents in which men allegedly affiliated with the security forces assaulted and detained journalists from various media outlets. In April 2013, an armed group attacked the offices of four separate newspapers, destroying equipment and assaulting employees. In May, the brother of an Iraqi reporter for Agence France-Presse was briefly kidnapped and reportedly warned by his abductors to tell his brother to stop covering corruption in Anbar province. In another incident, an Algerian photographer working for a the French publication Le Monde Diplomatique was detained for 23 days after photographing a location that authorities said was restricted. He was later accused of failing to register as a journalist as required by the Journalist Protection Law.\\nIn Kurdistan, physical attacks during 2013 included the murder of Kawa Germyani, a prominent Kurdish magazine editor investigating government corruption, who was shot dead in Sulaymaniyah in December. In February, a bomb exploded over the offices of an independent news channel, Nalia Radio and Television, a day after it aired criticism of Mustafa Barzani, former leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.\\nThe identities and motives of the assailants have remained unclear in most cases. In the December attack on the Salah al-Din television station, the Interior Ministry confirmed that security camera footage identified the killers, but no arrests were reported. In Kurdistan, security forces arrested seven people and issued an arrest warrant for an eighth following Germyani\\'s murder; six of the suspects were later released, and a trial was still pending at year\\'s end. The lack of prosecution in most cases has resulted in a climate of impunity.\\nHundreds of privately owned television, radio, and print media outlets have opened since the regime of Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003, producing content in Arabic, Kurdish, Syriac, Turkmen, and other languages. However, political parties and ethnic groups fund most media outlets, and journalists often cover political events from the point of view of a particular group, blurring the distinction between news and commentary. The government controls the Iraqi Media Network, a holding company that owns Al-Iraqiya television, Republic of Iraq Radio, and the newspaper Al-Sabah. Satellite dishes are legal, and as many as 97 percent of homes in Iraq have a dish. More than 30 satellite networks transmit into Iraq, including Al-Sharqiya, an Iraqi-owned station that broadcasts from Dubai; Qatar-based Al-Jazeera; and the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya.\\nAdvertising revenues alone are too small to sustain Iraq\\'s private media, and advertising with no editorial demands attached makes up only a small fraction of a typical outlet\\'s revenue. The government shapes the editorial content of some outlets by manipulating public advertising or pressuring private advertisers. Journalists have also reportedly slanted the news in return for bribes from officials, who offer money, land, and other rewards.\\nThe internet operates without government restriction, and usage has steadily increased since 2003. A growing number of Iraqis turn to digital and social media to spread information and consume news. However, poor infrastructure and sporadic access to electricity have made Iraq\\'s penetration rate for terrestrial internet access one of the lowest in the region. Instead, the majority of Iraqis who use the internet access it through wireless technology. The internet penetration rate stood at only 9.2 percent in 2013\\nDisclaimer: © Freedom House, Inc. · All Rights Reserved\\nThis is not a UNHCR publication.

       " 'Changes in the UK regulations encompassing wood waste may impact the way you deal with your waste management. How waste is handled and practices followed are changing throughout the construction and demolition industry, and it is important to stay in the loop and make sure that you are compliant.\\nAs experts in the field, here at REMONDIS we are keeping on top of the changes and have, therefore, put together the following article of information on the new regulations and what they mean for you and your business.\\nShould you feel as though you need a little more expert advice, be sure to get in touch with the team here at REMONDIS who’ll be able to guide you and answer any questions you may have.\\nWhat’s Changing In The Regulations of Recycling Wood Waste?\\nOn 1st September 2023, the Environmental Agency (EA) confirmed the withdrawal of the Regulatory Position Statement (RPS) 250 effective immediately. This decision to change the classification of ten different waste wood items follows five years of testing by the Wood Recyclers’ Association (WRA) to determine the hazardous waste contents of different waste wood products. This mainly affects ‘amber’ waste wood items, derived from construction and demolition (C&D), however, it may impact other industries.\\nThis means that certain waste wood categories that previously would be sent to wood recyclers will now be classed as hazardous waste unless proven otherwise through analysis. Therefore, this hazardous wood waste will need to be disposed of at a permitted facility.\\nWhat Does Your Company Need To Do?\\nHazardous and potentially hazardous waste wood from pre-2007 structures, or waste classed as Grade D wood waste, must be segregated and marked as hazardous waste. This waste includes:\\nHazardous Wood (Grade D)\\n- Telegraph Poles,\\n- CCA Treated Wood / Creosote Treated Wood,\\n- Railway Sleepers,\\n- Waste Wood from Hydraulic,\\n- Engineering I.e. Docks,\\n- Wood from Boats or Ships,\\n- Tailor Beds.\\nPotentially Hazardous Wood List (Pre-2007 Structures)\\n- Tiling, Cladding & Battens\\n- Barge Boards, Fascias & Soffits\\n- External Joinery,\\n- Timber Frames & Joists,\\n- External Doors,\\n- Roof Timbers.\\nThere are four grades of wood, also, that are classified as hazardous, non-hazardous or potentially hazardous:\\n- Grade A – the cleanest type of wood that is not hazardous. This includes the likes of pallets, packaging crates and offcuts.\\n- Grade B and C – may contain potentially hazardous wood, therefore requiring testing before disposal. This includes furniture, wooden fittings and chipboard.\\n- Grade D – hazardous waste, including wood types found in fencing, railway sleepers and cooling towers.\\nAny hazardous waste must not be sent to wood recyclers unless it is sent to be tested beforehand to demonstrate that it is not a risk.\\nWhat Do These Regulation Changes Mean For Your Company?\\nIf your company produces any of the above wood waste items from pre-2007 structures, they must now be treated as hazardous waste. You mustn’t dispose of these items with the rest of your waste wood.\\nInstead, you must book a separate hazardous waste collection or arrange suitable testing. If your items are proven to not contain hazardous elements, then they can be recycled with the rest of your wood as normal.\\nThe wood must be recycled with a confirmation of the test and the results.\\nWill Household Wood Waste Be Affected By These Regulation Changes?\\nHousehold wood waste follows the regulations of RPS 249. This will cover when a Household Waste Recycling Centre (HWRC) accepts domestic hazardous wood waste and stores it with non-hazardous wood waste. However, this is due to be withdrawn by 1 April 2024.\\nHousehold wood waste is constantly tested and the WRA is currently working to sample and test various domestic waste wood types. They currently have the expectations that hazardous contents are on the decline.\\nShould you have domestic wood waste to dispose of, it is recommended that you check in with your local HWRC for their guidelines.\\nArrange Your Waste Wood Collection and Disposal\\nAs a result of these changes to the waste wood regulations, most recyclers will change their regulations in the coming months to exclude these hazardous waste wood types. Unfortunately, many wood recycling facilities don’t have the provisions to accept and dispose of hazardous waste.\\nIf you are looking for a specialist in waste disposal to remove waste wood, make sure to get in touch with REMONDIS. Our experts can advise you on the type of wood you are dealing with and whether it may be hazardous, to conclude the best solution for disposal. Get in touch today and speak to one of our friendly team members about your wood waste.',\n",
       " 'The rise of remote work has transformed the traditional workplace, with companies worldwide embracing the concept of a remote workforce. But what\\'s in it for the employer?\\n- Remote work has proven to be a game-changer for businesses looking to gain a competitive edge.\\n- Remote work is a valuable tool for attracting and retaining top talent.\\n- Research shows remote workers are 13% more productive than their office-based counterparts.\\nIn this blog post, we\\'ll dive into everything you need to know about how remote work benefits employers.\\nFrom increased productivity and reduced overhead costs to expanded talent pools and better work-life balance for employees, remote work has proven to be a game-changer for businesses looking to gain a competitive edge.\\nEverything You Need To Know About How Remote Work Benefits Employers\\nWhile remote work was once considered a perk for employees, it has now become a necessity for many businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n- The ability to work remotely has allowed companies to maintain their operations while keeping their employees safe and healthy.\\n- In addition to being a critical business continuity strategy, remote work has also proven to be a valuable tool for attracting and retaining top talent.\\nWith more employees seeking flexible work arrangements, offering remote work options can easily make your company stand out in a crowded job market.\\nHow Remote Jobs Work\\nRemote jobs are similar to traditional employment in many ways, with a few key differences:\\n- Instead of working in a physical office, remote employees work from home, in a co-working space, or in any other location with a reliable internet connection.\\n- Employers and employees will communicate via video calls, email, instant messaging, and other online collaboration tools.\\nRemote work can be full-time or part-time, depending on the employer\\'s needs and the employee\\'s availability.\\nIs Remote Work Effective?\\nWhile remote work offers many benefits, one question that often arises is how effective it could be. After all, without the oversight of a traditional office environment, how can you ensure that your remote employees get their work done?\\nFortunately, research shows that remote work can be just as effective, if not more so, than traditional office work. A study by Stanford University found that remote workers were 13% more productive than their office-based counterparts.\\nRemote employees also tend to take fewer sick days and are more likely to work through minor illnesses, further increasing their productivity.\\nAnother study by Buffer found that 90% of remote workers had a good experience working remotely. This increased satisfaction leads to:\\n- Low turnover rates.\\n- Reducing recruitment and training costs for employers.\\n- Fewer chances of burnout.\\nHowever, to be effective, remote work requires clear communication and collaboration between employees and employers, and managers must be equipped with the most robust strategies to manage remote teams.\\nHow Remote Working Can Enhance Productivity of Your Employees\\nRemote working can actually enhance the productivity of your employees in several ways. The primary benefit is that remote employees can often better focus on their work without the distractions of a traditional office environment.\\nIn addition to this:\\n- They also have more control over their work environment, which leads to increased comfort and productivity.\\n- Remote work also eliminates the time and stress associated with commuting to and from work, allowing employees to use that time for more productive activities.\\n- Also, the flexible work hours of remote work help employees better balance their work and personal lives.\\nTo further enhance productivity, employers should provide their remote employees with the necessary tools and resources to succeed. This may include access to:\\n- Collaboration and communication software.\\n- Ergonomic workstations.\\n- Home office budget.\\n- And training on how to effectively manage their time and tasks.\\nThese Are the 9 Ways How Remote Work Benefits Employers\\nRemote work is all the rage these days. If you\\'re an employer, consider embracing remote work, as it comes with a bunch of unique benefits that a traditional office setting lacks.\\nFrom increased flexibility for employees to saving a lot on your compensation budget with location-indexed salaries, these are the 9 benefits of remote work for employers.\\n1. Increased Flexibility\\nAllowing employees to work from home can increase their flexibility and work-life balance, leading to:\\n- Improved morale.\\n- Job satisfaction.\\n- And productivity.\\nRemote workers can more easily balance their work with family responsibilities, personal interests, and other commitments without having to handle everything under pressure like it\\'s some burden they have on themselves.\\nAnd these benefits will only reflect in the overall performance of your company.\\n2. Reduced Overhead Costs\\nWorking remotely means nobody needs a physical space to operate from. So that eliminates the dependency on office rent, utilities, and supplies, helping you save on these overhead costs.\\nHowever, there still may be some expense involved here. Some remote companies will still have a physical HQ in their home country, where employees could occasionally come in.\\nSometimes it\\'s not really necessary, but companies might choose to have a physical office space here and there just for the sake of it. But for some companies (although rare), having at least a physical HQ is necessary for their smooth operation.\\n3. Access to a Larger Pool of Talent\\nRemote work comes with the advantage of hiring remotely. That means the barrier to hiring beyond a certain geographical constraint is now opened up for you.\\nYou can hire the best talent from anywhere in the world rather than being limited to a local pool of candidates. As a company engaged in remote work, you have the opportunity to hire talent residing beyond your city, state, or country.\\nThis basically opens up opportunities to tap into a diverse range of skills and perspectives and can help you find the right fit for your company\\'s needs.\\n4. Improved Retention\\nThe idea of working from anywhere appeals to a broad audience. Before the pandemic, it was a pipe dream for people with digital skills. But now, the opportunity to work remotely is a basic necessity that many companies offer.\\nEven better, according to a recent survey, 61% of employees that participated in the study preferred fully remote work.\\nSo if you offer your employees the opportunity to work remotely, they\\'ll stick with you for a longer time solely to utilize the benefits of remote work.\\n5. Reduced Absenteeism\\nWhen employees miss work, it causes:\\n- Disruptions to workflow, project delays, and ultimately affects the bottom line.\\n- Extra work for other employees who have to cover for the absent worker.\\n- A negative impact on workplace morale, as other employees may feel resentful toward those who are frequently absent.\\nBut remote work reduces the chances for an employee to miss work. It mostly comes down to the fact that they have better flexibility, helping them manage their work and other responsibilities efficiently.\\nAnd when employees work in close proximity to one another, illnesses can spread quickly throughout the office, leading to higher rates of absenteeism. So remote work helps with that as well.\\n6. Enhanced Diversity and Inclusion\\nRemote work helps to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace, as it allows you to tap into a wider pool of talent, including those with disabilities or other personal circumstances that may make it difficult for them to work in a traditional office setting.\\nHaving people from different backgrounds and cultures contributing to your company will help you become more and more creative. It makes your company a hub of variety, bringing in a lot of positive energy compared to a local, bland setting.\\n7. Increased Employee Engagement\\nRemote work also increases employee engagement, as employees are given more autonomy and trust in their work and can focus on tasks without distractions.\\nNow, some companies still micromanage their remote employees. Don\\'t do that. There\\'s nothing more discouraging at work for employees than having a manager peeking at their screen over their shoulder.\\nMany remote managers aren\\'t aware of the proper management process for remote work. So consider sitting down with your managers for a talk if you see them micromanaging.\\n8. Improved Morale\\nAs remote employees have the freedom to work when and where they choose, they often experience greater job satisfaction and a better work-life balance. This leads to a sense of:\\n- Stress reduction.\\n- And helps them prevent burnout.\\nAlso, remote work allows employees to work in environments that are more conducive to their personal preferences and needs. Some employees may prefer to work in quiet, distraction-free environments, while others may thrive in busy and collaborative settings.\\nAnd this autonomy results in improved morale among your remote employees.\\n9. Savings on Compensation Budget With Location-indexed Salary\\nRemote work gives you access to two types of compensation strategies: location-indexed salary and equal pay.\\nLocation-indexed salaries are based on the idea that the cost of living and prevailing wages can vary significantly from one location to another.\\nBy indexing employees\\' salaries to the cost of living in their location, you can attract and retain top talent from different countries. For example, if your company is based in a developed country like the US or UK, the minimum wage in your country would equal the top salary range of developing countries.\\nSo you have the option to go cheaper while still being able to hire the best talent out there!\\nDoes Remote Work Mean Work From Home?\\nOne common misconception about remote work is that it always means working from home.\\n- While working from home is certainly one option for remote workers, it\\'s not the only one.\\n- Whereas for employees working from home, their home is their only option to work from other than their office.\\nRemote employees can work from any location with a reliable internet connection, including co-working spaces, coffee shops, or even while traveling.\\nThe freedom to \"work from home\" is usually granted to employees as a flexible working option. That means for most employees working from home, that won\\'t be their permanent work location, and they\\'ll usually have to return to the office after some time (perhaps after a few days or weeks).\\nRemote work, on the other hand, is an entire contract on its own. You have no location constraints here, and the remote worker has the freedom to work from anywhere that\\'s physically possible as long as they are getting the work done as needed and on time.\\nRemote work has become a popular trend in recent years, which is not surprising considering its benefits.\\nRemote jobs are effective and can enhance the productivity of employees. Moreover, remote work offers employers a wide range of benefits, including reduced costs, access to a larger pool of talent, and increased employee retention, among others.\\nIt is worth noting that remote work does not necessarily mean working from home, as it can also involve working from anywhere with an internet connection.\\nWith many benefits on the table, you should consider embracing remote work as a viable option to help them achieve their organizational goals and stay competitive in today\\'s fast-paced work environment.\\nFollow us for more knowledge about remote work\\nWe\\'ll be publishing new articles every week, and new social media content every day.

Via the Online Training the participants receive insight information into Green Energy and Climate Finance. Thereupon, participants have an equal knowledge basis to attend the subsequent Face-to-Face Seminar in their country. Based on a capacity needs assessment conducted by RENAC in the second half of 2017, different interests and demands were identified for each country. Consequently, different RE/EE technologies will be presented during the seminars in the respective countries.\\nThe Face-to-Face Seminar will comprise the following topics:\\n- Fundamentals of the RE or EE technology focus (according to the table above)\\n- Bankability of RE projects (Risk assessment, project appraisal etc.)\\n- Accessibility of international climate funds (e.g. Green Climate Fund)\\nDuring these three days attendance training, participants will receive a hands-on training presented by German and local experts. To make sure that the knowledge transferred during the seminars is applicable, exercises and case studies will be adjusted to local particularities.\\nThe Applying Green Energy Finance Programme is specifically targeted at professionals from financial institutions interested in acquiring knowledge in the field of Green Energy and Climate Finance.\\nThese professionals may be:\\n- Credit Analysts\\n- Project Finance Specialists\\n- Client Relationship Managers\\n- The participation in the seminar is free of charge and includes training material (color printed hard copies), and catering for the duration of the seminar\\n- Course material is provided in English in Egypt and Jordan and in French in Morocco and Tunisia\\n- Lecturers present in English in Egypt and Jordan and in French in Morocco and Tunisia\\n- The location for the Kick-off workshop and the Face-to-Face seminar is in the partner country; participants are informed in due time about the details of the venue for the seminar\\n- Travel and accommodation costs are covered by the participant\\nThe application phase for the Applying Green Energy Finance Programme and the Online Training will end on 21 July 2019.

       " 'Speaking at Retail Destination Live, held earlier this summer at the Jury’s Inn hotel at Hinckley Island, Dr Amna Khan, senior lecturer in consumer behaviour at Manchester Metropolitan University, discussed the ‘omnichannel seamless experience’ where consumers do not see channels, they shop, and they crave experiences that are convenient and seamless “We’re getting a hybridisation of online and offline,” she told the audience.\\nDr Khan said stores had introduced technology to change the customer’s journey and create an omni channel experience. Retailer Zara has an app that has an in-store mode, where shoppers can continue to use the app in the bricks-and-mortar store to reserve fitting rooms, locate stock on the exact shelf or rail and use scan-and-go technology. She said consumers want to get in and out of a store with the same speed and efficiency as they get online.\\nShe spoke about Click and Collect and also contactless collection and said this was where technology really comes into play. “Zara is actually using self-service collection – they have storage for 1,500 parcels within their store. So, what does that mean about the future for retailers? Are they going to be like fulfilment centres where they’re Amazon in the back office and offer an experience in the front office?”\\nDr Khan went on to talk about returns. She said that online shopping during the pandemic had made consumers very confident about just ordering multiple items for choice and sending back what they didn’t want. But returns were hurting retailers so they were working on modifying customer behaviour by introducing a charge. She cited Zara again, where returns cost £1.95 which is taken off the refunded amount, but you can return the item free in-store. And getting those shoppers in the store was important as 70% of those collecting or returning parcels make impulse in-store purchases\\nShe also talked about conscious consumption and how the consumer thought much more about their buying habits. “During the pandemic, consumers had time to think, reconsider and reflect on their consumption behaviour,” she said, mentioning the growth of sites such as the Too Good To Go food waste management system and asking whether a similar model could be used for other perishable goods.\\nThis was first published in Retail Destination Fortnightly.

       " \"for Panasonic 3DO\\nRoad Rash is a 1991 racing video game originally developed and published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Genesis. It was subsequently ported to a variety of contemporary systems by differing companies. The game is based on a series of road races throughout California that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the debut installment in the Road Rash game series.\\nRoad Rash was the first title to be developed by Electronic Arts following the company's decision to begin developing games internally. The game was influenced by designer Randy Breen's enthusiasm for motorcycles, the technical advantages granted by motorcycles as opposed to cars, and the violent behavior of Grand Prix motorcyclists during races. The 32-bit versions of the game feature 25 minutes of live-action full-motion video footage and a soundtrack primarily consisting of licensed grunge music courtesy of A&M Records. The effort to license the music of Soundgarden for the title led to the inclusion of other alt-rock bands such as Monster Magnet and Swervedriver.\\nRoad Rash was released to critical and commercial success. The original version for the Sega Genesis was particularly acclaimed for its violent and aggressive gameplay and the convincing sense of speed in its graphics, while the 3DO version was commended for its advanced visuals and grunge-based soundtrack. Reception of other versions ranged from positive to middling, with the later versions being considered dated by the time of their release. The game was followed by a series of sequels made for various consoles.\\nPayment & Security\\nYour payment information is processed securely.

Wonder how many of the people with “Bud Light Party” buttons on are soaking this in.\\n2:54 women and men are using the same bathroon.

So good.\\n3:24 why isn’t Pharoah Monch on the main stage?\\n3:45 Goldlink was hitting it hard as I walked by, but I need water, so didn’t get to hear much.

Did the guy from Blink 182 start a rap group?\\n4:03 it is as beautiful of a day as one could create, i have a beer in hand, everything is good…and i still find nothing enjoyable about Prof. Guess it is official.\\n4:12 on a more positive note: beautiful crowd here.

Top notch.\\n4:39 “the people” and “the corner” remind us why Common is so great\\n4:45 I didn’t know Domo Genesis from ODD future, but his grimey raps seem to have drawn a huge crowd.

Also, only being able to buy tickets 10 at a time is a scam.\\n5:31 massive sing along to Post Malone. Sounds awesome. Reminds me of what Allan Kingdom et al are doing.

Huh. I’m clearly out of touch.\\nWrap-up: Great day. Seamless move to the fairgrounds. As is often the case at festivals, I enjoyed the mid-level acts and finding new artists over the jam-packed headliners.

       " 'Before basketball hoops were designed to resist the force of certain plays, the sport of basketball has seen legendary, glass-shattering dunks throughout its history. A “Shaq attack” by the legendary Shaquille “Shaq” O’Neal became a coined term during his career because he unofficially damaged 12.5 basketball rims, shattered backboards, and even brought down entire stanchions with his overpowering strength and size; during his playing days, O’Neal clocked in at 7’1”, 375 pounds. In 2020, one professional player dunked the ball so hard he bent the entire rim. Even more recently on February 4, 2023 play was delayed for 43 minutes during a game due to a crooked rim.\\nSince the NCAA college basketball tournament is in full swing, basketball has been on our minds. As such, we decided to use Altair simulation tools to push a basketball hoop model to its limits to see how much force a backboard can withstand before it breaks (keeping in mind current design regulations). Not only that, but how does a player’s direction, angle, weight, and force contribute to shattering a backboard? Or is there a completely different variable that causes this to happen?',\n",
       " 'Today\\'s post is inspired by a tweet from @Cloudscope1, who wrote, \"What are your top three tips for getting more articles done in a day? Currently I\\'m doing about 2.\" Without further ado, my suggestions:\\n- Set a goal for each post and write to achieve that goal. What\\'s the takeaway you want your readers to get after finishing your article? Start with the point of your article -- even if it ends up being the last sentence -- and continue building from that foundation. This strategy helps focus your thoughts and cut down on your self-editing.\\n- Gamify your work periods. I swear by artificially constricting work periods and using strong incentives to reward efficient behavior. Level up your writing periods by setting a challenging goal -- an old favorite of mine is \"two articles before my second cup of coffee\" -- and an attractive reward for achieving it. This method alone has doubled, maybe even tripled, my productivity. (Here are some other ideas on how to leverage Parkinson\\'s Law if you\\'re feeling especially ambitious.)\\n- Recognize your strengths and weaknesses. I rock at writing in the morning and late at night, so that\\'s when I do the bulk of my blogging. Conversely, I have trouble thinking analytically in the middle of the day, so I use that time to exercise, run errands or catch up on my reading. Try tracking your energy levels during a workday and take note of when you\\'re feeling especially creative and prone to efficient writing. Then dedicate those blocks of time to blogging.\\nComplement these strategies by adapting some of these habits of high-performance writers to really crank things up.',\n",

Now, TKO Group Holdings CEO Ari Emmanuel has given his statement regarding the big move.\\nAs announced, the content streaming giant, Netflix will be the new home for the longest-running weekly episodic television show in history, RAW starting in 2025. This would see WWE’s long-time partnership with previous broadcaster, USA Network coming to an end after nearly 20 years.\\nThe announcement garnered significant reactions from stars and fans alike. Moreover, Ari Emmanuel himself called a huge move forward for WWE to partner up with the global leader in content streaming.

I don’t think linear is going away, I don’t think cable is going away, but there is a push to streaming. On this deal, we did that early on with the UFC on ESPN and ESPN Plus. From our perspective, this is the next iteration of where this goes. We have a linear play with SmackDown and NXT. This is the streaming play. For us, it was the next step. It’s a great deal for Netflix, in our opinion. They get 150 hours of programming over $5 billion dollars. It’s like two and a half movies for 150. For us, it’s the global player in streaming. It’s a great deal.”\\nWWE has reportedly secured a ten-year-long deal, worth a whooping $5 Billion or $500 Million per year. Moreover, the stock prices for all the parties involved in the deal have seen significant growth as well.\\nWith the global juggernaut ready to usher in a new era with Netflix, we will have to wait and see how this new partnership unfolds next year.\\nWhat are your thoughts on WWE RAW moving to Netflix?

The Foundations of AI, Big Data and Data Science Landscape for Professionals in Healthcare, Business, and Government (978-0-367-35968-3, 325690)\\nProfessionals are challenged each day by a changing landscape of technology and terminology. In recent history, especially in the last 25 years, there has been an explosion of terms and methods that automate and improve decision-making and operations. One term, \"analytics,\" is an overarching description of a compilation of methodologies. But AI (artificial intelligence), statistics, decision science, and optimization, which have been around for decades, have resurged. Also, things like business intelligence, online analytical processing (OLAP) and many, many more have been born or reborn. How is someone to make sense of all this methodology and terminology?\\nThis book, the first in a series of three, provides a look at the foundations of artificial intelligence and analytics and why readers need an unbiased understanding of the subject. The authors include the basics such as algorithms, mental concepts, models, and paradigms in addition to the benefits of machine learning. The book also includes a chapter on data and the various forms of data. The authors wrap up this book with a look at the next frontiers such as applications and designing your environment for success, which segue into the topics of the next two books in the series.\\nForeword Number One.

       " \"The participation of Roux Arts in the NAEA conference was a carefully orchestrated affair, designed to leave a lasting impact on the attendees. The company's approach was multifaceted, focusing on interactive experiences, collaborations, and educational insights, all aimed at enriching the art education dialogue. One of the most notable contributions of Roux Arts was a series of workshops and seminars that they hosted during the conference. These sessions were crafted to not only educate but also inspire the educators in attendance. The workshops covered a range of topics, from innovative art techniques to integrating technology in art education, reflecting the company's forward-thinking approach to art and teaching.\\nThese workshops, led by a team of experienced artists and educators from Roux Arts, were more than just instructional sessions. They were immersive experiences that encouraged participants to explore new ideas and techniques. For instance, one workshop focused on the integration of digital mediums with traditional painting techniques, a concept that resonates with the contemporary shift in the art world. This session was particularly well-received, as it provided educators with practical insights into how they could incorporate such modern approaches into their curriculums, thereby making their teaching more relevant and engaging in the digital age.\\nAnother significant aspect of Roux Arts' participation was the emphasis on collaboration and community building. Recognizing the importance of networking in the art education field, Roux Arts facilitated several meet-and-greet events, allowing educators to connect with each other and with professionals from the art world. These networking sessions were not just about building contacts; they were about creating a community of educators who could share resources, experiences, and inspiration. The company's role in fostering these connections underscored its commitment to building a supportive and collaborative art education community.\\nThe Roux Arts exhibition booth at the conference was a hub of activity and interest. Here, the company showcased an array of artworks from both established and emerging artists. This exhibition was carefully curated to demonstrate the diversity and dynamism of contemporary art. It featured a range of styles and mediums, from classical oil paintings to experimental digital art, reflecting the eclectic nature of modern art. For many educators, this exhibition was an eye-opener, presenting them with a tangible sense of the current trends and directions in the art world. It also served as a source of inspiration, offering ideas and themes that they could take back to their classrooms and students.\\nIn addition to showcasing art, the Roux Arts booth also served as a platform for dialogue and exchange. The company's representatives, including artists and art educators, were present to engage with the attendees, answer their questions, and discuss various aspects of art and teaching. These conversations often delved into the challenges faced by art educators today, such as integrating new technologies in the classroom, dealing with budget constraints, and keeping art education relevant in an increasingly STEM-focused educational environment. Through these discussions, Roux Arts not only gained valuable insights into the needs and concerns of art educators but also established itself as a company that listens and responds to the community it serves.\\nRoux Arts' involvement in the NAEA conference extended beyond workshops, networking, and exhibitions. The company also played a role in some of the panel discussions and keynote speeches. These sessions, featuring prominent figures in the art and education sectors, addressed a range of topics, from policy and funding for arts education to the evolving role of art in society. Representatives from Roux Arts contributed to these discussions, sharing their perspectives and insights, drawn from their extensive experience in the art world. Their participation in these high-level discussions demonstrated the company's depth of knowledge and its commitment to contributing to the broader conversation about art education.\\nAnother highlight of Roux Arts' participation was its focus on student engagement and development. The company sponsored a student art competition in conjunction with the conference, inviting young artists from various schools to submit their works. This competition was not just about recognizing talent; it was about encouraging young artists to pursue their passion for art. The entries were displayed at the conference, providing these young artists with a platform to showcase their work to a wider audience. For many students, this was a unique opportunity to receive feedback from professional artists and educators, an experience that could be pivotal in their artistic journeys.\\nRoux Arts' presence at the NAEA conference was also an opportunity for the company to showcase its latest initiatives and projects. Among these was an innovative art education program that the company had recently launched, aimed at bringing art education to underserved communities. This program, which involved partnering with schools and community centers, was designed to provide access to quality art education for children who might not otherwise have the opportunity. By highlighting this and other similar initiatives, Roux Arts demonstrated its commitment to making art accessible to all, reinforcing the idea that art education should be a universal right, not a privilege.\\nIn conclusion, Roux Arts' participation in the National Art Education Association conference was a multifaceted endeavor that showcased the company's dedication to art education. Through workshops, exhibitions, discussions, and community-building activities, Roux Arts not only contributed to the enrichment of art education but also reinforced its position as a leader in the contemporary art world. The company's involvement in the conference was a clear indication of its commitment to nurturing the next generation of artists and educators, a commitment that is sure to have a lasting impact on the field of art education.\",\n",

       " 'The truth is, even when you give it your best shot, weight loss might not happen in all the right places, leaving stubborn fat resistant to diet and exercise. This is where our Sacramento liposuction procedure can help.\\nWhy Choose Liposuction?\\nAccording to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), of the over 2 million surgical cosmetic medical procedures performed by plastic surgeons in the United States in 2007 alone, liposuction was number one. Liposuction – also known as suction-assisted lipectomy – is a body contouring procedure that permanently removes the localized fat that does not respond to a healthy lifestyle. With that said, it should not be considered a substitute for diet and exercise.\\nDo you still have unwanted bulges even when you’re at your “skinny” weight? Many times it comes down to genetics. No matter how many miles you’ve put on the treadmill, no matter how many desserts you’ve skipped, you still cannot get rid of your problem areas.\\nBut with liposuction, you can congratulate yourself knowing you’ve selected the most popular cosmetic procedure in the U.S. and one of the most requested right here in Sacramento – liposuction. This procedure can forever rid you of those hard-to-lose pockets of fat in your buttocks, thighs, abdomen, upper arms or back. Perhaps it’s a little “double chin” that’s bothering you. Whatever your concern is, our doctors can help.\\nIf you’re considering liposuction, call 916-929-1833 to schedule a consultation today.\\nPlanning For Your Liposuction Procedure\\nLiposuction should not be mistaken for a weight-loss surgery. It is meant to reduce unwanted pockets of fat on the body that have been resistant to your diet and exercise efforts. The closer you are to your weight loss goal, the more effective liposuction tends to be at achieving attractive, trim contours.\\nAhead of your surgery, you will have a consultation with one of Sacramento’s finest plastic surgeons. During this meeting, your surgeon provides a detailed explanation of what liposuction can realistically achieve for your unique body.\\nYour surgeon at The Plastic Surgery Center in Sacramento can determine if you’re a good candidate. Other body sculpting procedures, such as a tummy tuck or body lift might be recommended as a better alternative to achieve your specific goals. Prior to any cosmetic surgery procedure, be sure to follow your plastic surgeon’s instructions on taking medications and vitamins, eating, drinking and stopping smoking.\\nAreas Where Liposuction Is Effective\\nLiposuction is a versatile surgery that can successfully treat most areas of the body where fat accumulates. These includes\\n- Upper arms\\n- Male breast tissue\\nHow Fat Removal With Liposuction Is Performed\\nDepending on its complexity, the procedure lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. You may receive general anesthesia or sedation with local anesthesia. The plastic surgeon makes a small incision so that a hollow tube, called a cannula, can be inserted. The cannula is attached to a vacuum machine, which is then manipulated deep within the fatty layers under the skin to break up the fat and suction it out. Fluids are infiltrated into the tissue prior to liposuction to improve and enhance the fat removal.\\nThe treated area will be bandaged with a snug elastic dressing to control swelling and bleeding; it also helps your skin to shrink to fit your new, more slender contour. You may be heavier initially due to the swelling after surgery. The suctioned areas will be swollen and bruised, and you might feel some burning. Sometimes, the suctioned area will feel “funny” or a little numb for a while. Medication will be given to lessen any pain or discomfort. You should avoid strenuous activity for at least two weeks. If you have any bleeding or severe pain, be sure to call your doctor.\\nAlthough you are likely to notice a somewhat trimmer figure immediately after your surgery, you should be patient in judging your results until they are final. It can take several months for the swelling and bruising to fully subside and reveal your new contours. Results from liposuction are considered indefinite. Fat cell removal is permanent, so you can maintain your contoured physique for as long as you maintain a steady weight moving forward.\\nThe cost of liposuction varies from patient to patient, with the most important factors being the type of liposuction performed, the specific area(s) being treated and the total number of areas receiving contouring. During a consultation, your surgeon can devise a surgical plan that includes a thorough cost breakdown so you know what to expect. Since liposuction is an elective, cosmetic procedure, it is not covered by most health insurance plans. The Plastic Surgery Center does offer financing options if you would like to make payments toward the total cost of liposuction.\\nWhat types of fat can liposuction effectively target?\\nLiposuction is ideal for localized areas of fat that never seem to shrink and seem immune to traditional lifestyle approaches. For example, a person may exercise regularly and lose weight through a balanced diet and still retain excess fat in the hips or thighs.\\nIn addition to the hips and thighs, patients commonly seek reductions in the abdomen, buttocks, arms, neck or back. Men may also choose liposuction as a way to treat gynecomastia, a condition characterized by an increased volume of fat in the chest area. Liposuction is sometimes used to treat jowls and cheeks, although The Plastic Surgery Center team may recommend alternative procedures for facial areas.\\nSome types of fat cannot be removed by liposuction. In many obese individuals, the abdominal fat that produces the unwanted overhanging belly profile surrounds internal organs. Because it is located below the muscle, it is not safe to remove this type of fat.\\nDoes liposuction treat cellulite or stretch marks?\\nLiposuction is not a treatment for improving the appearance of skin. The elasticity of a patient’s skin is a key factor in how the skin will look after the procedure. If skin is elastic and muscle tone is good, the skin will conform well to the new body shape. With skin that has been stretched and is less elastic, folds of skin may be apparent after removal of fat.\\nCellulite and stretch marks are also not likely to improve significantly, although there may be a slight smoothing of the area, depending on the firmness of your skin. A patient with realistic expectations will be pleased by the way the procedure can sculpt the body, restoring the attractive proportions of a fit and balanced profile.\\nWill the fat return?\\nIf you change the lifestyle behavior that led to obesity, you will not need to worry about those pockets of fat returning. The cells that were removed during liposuction are gone and will never grow back. But if your weight begins to rise again, adjoining fat cells will expand to store the excess caloric intake. Regular exercise and eating nutritious foods in limited quantities are the best ways to preserve your new shape.\\nAre there less-invasive options?\\nWhen it comes to removing stubborn pockets of fat, CoolSculpting is one highly effective alternative. This technique involves freezing cells in the flabby “pinchable” areas of body fat. These crystallized cells are then absorbed by the body over a period of weeks or months. The gradual reduction of fat in targeted areas allows your skin to progressively shrink to cover your new profile.\\nHow much weight can liposuction help me lose?\\nOur surgeons must stress that liposuction is not intended for weight loss. To lose weight, you should try diet and exercise, or perhaps bariatric surgery. Liposuction is a body contouring procedure that works best on patients who are within 10 pounds of their goal weight. You will see better results if you lose weight with a healthy lifestyle and then use liposuction to help improve the appearance of your trimmed down physique.\\nHow is tumescent liposuction different from traditional liposuction?\\nCompared to traditional liposuction, tumescent liposuction utilizes smaller incisions, milder anesthesia and a saline solution that helps to break up the fat tissue. In combination, these factors provide an easier recovery, fewer complication risks and highly effective body contouring. These days, our surgeons often recommend tumescent liposuction as the best approach for many of our patients.\\nWill I have loose skin after liposuction?\\nThe way your skin looks after liposuction depends on its current condition. Patients with younger, elastic-like skin should see their skin contract to fit the new contours achieved with liposuction. Those whose skin is not as supple may see their skin sag, unfortunately.\\nYour surgeon can discuss what you can expect to see after liposuction, as well as additional treatments you may be interested in such as laser skin tightening procedures or a “lift” surgery like tummy tuck, thigh lift or arm lift that removes excess skin to rejuvenate a section of the body.\\nCall 916-929-1833 now to learn more about medical spa services, facial rejuvenation and cosmetic surgery procedures for both men and women, such as liposuction. Sacramento plastic surgeons at The Skin Care Center and at The Plastic Surgery Center make enhancing the body, mind and spirit easy.

       " '“I am prepared for the aquaculture industry to say that this will not work because nobody has done this before. But that’s not right. My partner Arve Gravdal has produced adult salmon in Scotland. I have seen it myself.”\\nTerje Mikalsen (78), a multimillionaire entrepreneur and investor is joining forces with Niri founder, Arve Gravdal, for a new land-based salmom farming site. Together they have hired Fearnley Securities to help look for EUR 4.1 million investment funding for the project.\\n4.1 million investment\\nNew shareholders will receive about one third of the shares in the new company EFC Scotland, and the rest will be owned by Mikalsen and Gravdal as reported in Dagens Næringsliv.\\nEFC has recently taken over a small farm in Campbeltown, Scotland, and plans to build a land based facility on Lista, south Norway. This is also where Mikalsen is from.\\nPlants must produce their own feed\\nAccording to Mikalsen, the new land-based fish farm will capture carbon dioxide produced by salmon, and will use it to produce bacteria converted into proteins. He says that this will cover about half of the fish’s protein needs.\\n“This has not been done before with CO2 from farmed fish. The process will create high-grade clean feed and reduce the use of imported soybean meal. We will integrate farming with an electrolysis plant where water is cleaved to oxygen and hydrogen. Large amounts of oxygen are required for the fish, and the rest of the oxygen together with the hydrogen and the captured CO2 must be used to make protein via bacteria. This is known technology. The electrolysis also emits large amounts of heat that can be used to dry the protein, and regulate the temperature in the farming tanks,” said Mikalsen.\\nNobody has done this before\\nPressed if he is sure that this method will work, Mikalsen answered:\\n“I am prepared for the aquaculture industry to say that this will not work because nobody has done this before. But that’s not right. My partner Arve Gravdal has produced adult fish in Scotland. I have seen it myself,” said Mikalsen.\\nArne Gravdal, leads the RAS technology provider Niri, which, under its subsidary, Niri Scotland, established a pilot plant to create 40,000 tonnes of salmon in 2015. The site at the Machrihanish Airbase near Campbelltown in Scotland, was at its time, the world’s largest tank for salmon production. However in In February 2018, the company’s shareholders decided to offer the facility for sale.\\nIn September, Niri reported a loss of EUR 2.6 million since it started in 2006. In 2017 the company lost EUR 473 thousand.\\nMost adventurous adventure\\nMikalsen is behind Norsk Data, a Norwegian minicomputer manufacturer, and pharmaceutical company, Hafslund Nycomed, but has no background in farming.\\n“I tend to mess up with things I basically do not deal with. It is probably the most adventurous adventure I have been on, but I really believe in this. Because we are talking about revamping land-based farming” he said to the newspaper, adding that they have already established a collaboration with the major retailers, Marks and Spencer, among others.',\n",

       " 'Heating contractors invited to bid for £600m social housing procurement framework\\nSpecialist heating contractors from across Scotland are being invited to submit bids to take part in a new £600 million procurement framework specifically designed to help registered social landlords meet their obligations under the Energy Efficiency Standard for Social Housing (EESSH).\\nThe new framework is being launched by PfH Scotland, the procurement specialist jointly owned by the National Housing Federation, the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) and HouseMark.\\nWith a specific focus on heating measures, the framework is expected to generate contract work with a total value of around £600m over four years across the social housing sector in Scotland.\\nIntroduced in 2014, EESSH aims to improve the energy efficiency of social housing in Scotland while reducing energy consumption, fuel poverty and the emission of greenhouse gases and is expected to make an important contribution towards meeting the requirements set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 to reduce carbon emissions by 42% by 2020 and by 80% by 2050.\\nTo meet the standard, all social housing in Scotland must achieve an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of Band D or better by 2020.\\nFollowing a process of vetting, shortlisting and selecting contractors, the framework is expected to go live in September of this year.\\nThe framework has been split over six defined geographic regions with the aim of encouraging applications from smaller local contractors. PfH Scotland is also offering a range of bid support and advice for SMEs with limited or no experience of tendering for public sector work.\\nTo further support participation be smaller local contractors, evaluation of tenders will also be 70% weighted in favour of quality and 30% on price.\\nIn each geographic region, the framework has been broken down into 13 individual lots covering services ranging from energy performance certification to domestic and commercial gas servicing and from the installation of renewables to architectural services. Those tendering can submit responses for any or all of these individual lots and will then be required to identify the geographic areas within each lot that they can service.\\nContractors have until July 17 to register an interest in the framework and to submit their bid. Alongside competitive pricing, technical competence and a strong track record in health and safety, those applying will be assessed according to their ability to demonstrate high quality service, market expertise, transparency and integrity alongside innovation and the use of new technologies. Contractors able to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and social value and a capacity to deliver local community benefit will be marked particularly high.\\nCommenting on the launch of the new framework, PfH Scotland head of operations, Stephen Herriot, said: “We are very pleased to be able to announce the launch of a new £600 million procurement framework dedicated to delivering heating measures designed to help social landlords across Scotland make ongoing progress towards improving the energy efficiency of their housing stock.\\n“Based on feedback from our members and provisions set out under the 2014 Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act, we have sought to design this new framework in a way that actively encourages participation from smaller local contractors. This includes selecting contractors to serve six individual regions across Scotland and placing a much greater emphasis in the assessment of bids on quality, service and local community benefit – rather than focusing predominantly on price.”\\nStephen Herriot added: “I would encourage heating contractors of all sizes, including those who may have no previous experience of tendering for public sector contracts, to submit applications to take part in this new framework. It is an important opportunity to secure new work while helping drive ongoing improvements in the energy efficiency of social housing across Scotland.”\\nFurther information about the PfH Scotland EESSH heating services framework is available on the Public Contracts Scotland website.',\n",

       " 'You’d think buying a gun or obtaining a license for one was easy, but it’s not. If you want to make your purchase through a Federal Firearms Licensee, either at a store or a gun show, you have to go through Pennsylvania’s Instant Check System, also referred to as PICS. PICS is a system that is run by the Pennsylvania State Police. Its purpose is to give instant background checks to gun suppliers on people who try to make gun purchases, so they can decide if a person is legally allowed to buy a gun. PICS is also used to determine if a person is eligible to obtain a concealed carry license.\\nIf you are thinking about either buying a firearm or getting your concealed carry license, Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney Sean Logue and his team of experienced attorneys can help you get ready to fill out the application and evaluate your circumstances to identify anything that might be a problem for you.\\nThe applications you must complete to purchase a firearm are the PA Form SP4-113 and the ATF Form 4473. The form you complete when you apply for a concealed carry license is PA Form SP4-127. These forms are all confusing and very complex. Even attorneys sometimes have trouble understanding the questions. However, a mistake on any of the three applications can lead you to be charged with a felony.\\nSean Logue and his team have defended many people who thought they could outsmart PICS or who either didn’t understand their criminal record or the questions on the forms. If you give false information on one of those forms, you can be charged with a specific charge: a Misdemeanor 18 Pa.C.S Section 4904 Unsworn Falsification to Authorities, or a Felony 18 Pa.C.S. Section 6111 Unsworn Falsification to Authorities. You could also be charged with both.\\nAny prior mental health issue, involvement in domestic violence of any form (including Protection From Abuse actions), drug abuse, or any kind of criminal record, you need to contact Logue Law Group before you try to fill out a firearm purchase application or concealed carry license application. Sean and his team can keep you from being their next criminal defense client.\\nDon’t try to go completing these forms without assistance. Your freedom from additional criminal charges is too important to leave to chance. Let Sean Logue and his team of experienced Pittsburgh criminal defense attorneys assist you as you prepare to complete the complex and confusing state and federal gun ownership and carry applications. Sean and his team will do their best to get you prepared to purchase the firearm you desire.\\nIf you are deemed by PICS to be ineligible to purchase a gun or concealed carry license, you will be given a challenge form by the dealer. You have 30 days to complete the form and appeal the decision. You will need to give PICS additional details to help them in their review. If you were denied because a conviction was expunged or otherwise disposed of, include that information. Also, you need to make sure you complete all the sections of the form. Failure to do so will cause your challenge to be automatically denied. There are four pages to complete. On the first page, parts one through three have to be filled in completely, and on page four, you have to sign and date the form. A Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney can help you with this.\\nDo you plan on purchasing a firearm? Do you know someone who is? If so, you need a criminal defense attorney who knows and understands the laws around the possession of firearms to assist you. The Logue Criminal Defense team has helped hundreds of people prepare to complete firearms purchase applications and concealed carry paperwork.

       " 'This is the time of year when, sometimes, even good boys and girls go a little wild.\\nThe prom season is upon us, and commencement ceremonies are imminent – which means that senior activities, both in and out of high school, are likely in full swing. “After Proms,” graduation practice, parties, and even Senior Skip Days are prime opportunities for kids to let loose.\\nI think if we all took a stroll down memory lane, we’d remember the one classmate who pulled a senior prank (and got busted), drank a little bit too much cheap liquor during prom (and got busted), or skipped school one or five too many times (and got busted).\\nWhen I take that stroll, I remember That Kid being horrified, and even angry, that the administration threatened not to let him walk with his friends for graduation. I remember it being a big deal, both with school administration, teachers, and classmates. I remember parents not being pleased.\\nNow, as an adult, I know it’s a big deal – and I know exactly how displeased parents can get.\\nFast forward, and all these years later, I’m a Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney who has represented numerous students in high school and college who needed a little help navigating the academic sanctions process.\\nMy firm has represented students facing academic suspension, expulsion, and other serious ramifications. And I want to make sure – especially at this time of year, when the culmination of 12 or 13 years of academic work is in the balance – that parents know that if their son or daughter gets in trouble in the waning days of his or her high school career, they are not only entitled to be represented by a Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney, but it’s also highly recommended.\\nIt’s not just high school kids who face academic sanctions. Colleges also have them, and with the days getting longer, those students are also letting loose. The disciplinary procedures in institutes of higher learning can often be even more harsh than high school ones. Student athletes have more on the line, for example, if they are hoping to go pro after graduation. Students who are on scholarships could potentially lose their funding, ending their academic career.\\nStudents might find themselves facing not just academic sanctions but criminal charges, as well. Often, universities will academically discipline a student for criminal charges they received, even if the crime did not happen on campus or at a school-sponsored event. Between the two, a student’s future beyond college is in jeopardy. Some employers don’t want workers with criminal records. And, some professions, like teaching, disallow people who have committed certain crimes.\\nIf your son or daughter is facing academic discipline procedures, please know that they can be confusing, and the ramifications severe and far-reaching. Just like you wouldn’t go into a criminal court hearing without a Pittsburgh criminal defense attorney, it might be most wise to solicit the services of an attorney adept in working in the world of academia – and its various disciplinary boards and procedures.\\nAt Logue Law Group, we handle enough of these types of cases that we even contract with a local lawyer who has also long served as a school director and who has in-depth knowledge and understanding of the ins and outs of student discipline matters.\\nSo, if your son or daughter gets into a jam, don’t freak out. Give me a call and let me or one of my associates help. Don’t wait to call. The longer you wait to hire legal representation, the more difficult it will be to obtain a good outcome for your child’s case, an outcome that will allow him or her to walk at commencement with friends and classmates.\\nFree ConsultationYou will never find us short of knowledge & commitment\\nwhile handling your case.',\n",
       " '4 June 2021\\nHow I take photos\\nTaking photos has made me pay more attention to my surroundings when I travel. I noticed details I would have overlooked. Inevitably, I end up spending a significant amount of time in any given spot – at least much more than the duration “recommended” by travel books. Over time, my photography skills have improved too: I’m a good amateur, but a far cry from being a pro even if I get a rough sense of the areas I need to pay more attention to. But maybe I’m just making up excuses!\\nWith 130,000 photos taken over the past 15 years, my organisation system has remained robust; I even considered hiring someone to focus on the sale of my best shots since I had some preliminary data that this endeavour could be profitable. I still spend too much time organising and not enough enjoying though – a classic dilemma that I try to address in an article on trade-offs that I haven’t managed to finalise and publish in months.\\nHaving said that, I do try to give a (second) life to those photos by embedding them in my stories. I would either have an idea for a story and then find the best photos in my collection to illustrate it, or I would go through my photos of a particular location and they would nudge me towards writing “something” about them. That “something” isn’t always straightforward. Some research (on the history, the culture, the people) however does help in getting a story to take seed in my mind.\\nAnother way to keep my photos alive is to talk about my shooting process. I could limit myself to explaining my photographic decisions (composition, settings) after the fact. However, Nigel Danson’s videos inspired me to take it a step further and do the explanation in the field i.e. as I’m about to take a shot. Now that is obviously a little more complicated to set up, since it requires me to use a microphone and have something interesting to say even though I’m improvising. It’s a good way to share tips as well. Have a look at that first try and let me know what you think:\\nI quite enjoyed recording and editing this video: it’s a pleasant combination of photography, videography and giving a talk. In general, I believe there’s a lot of value for anyone to see how others do things, in all domains. After all, that’s how I learned the ukulele. I was about to add “on my own” but that’s technically not correct since my teachers were plenty of different ones who took the time to publish videos on YouTube.\\nMany projects await me at the intersection of training and video. I’ll likely continue to dabble in different genres and topics before settling on a few (ideally one, but I find it tough to reign myself in). Stay tuned for more!',\n",
       " \"Do you usually shampoo at night and not dry your hair before going to bed? Find out why you should banish this bad habit from your beauty routine!\\nAs we know, there are two camps when it comes to determining the best time of day to wash. Some prefer to take their shower in the morning to wake up well while others do not derogate from the evening shower to get rid of the bacteria of the day and to relax after long hours of work which are felt in all their muscles. If you are part of this second camp who takes a shower more at night, it is very likely that you do your shampoo at the same time, that is to say, a little before going to bed. And besides, those who wash in the morning sometimes also make an exception on shampooing day to save time the next day when they wake up. So you've probably washed your hair at least once in the evening before going to bed.\\nRest assured, if washing your hair in the evening rather than in the morning isn't a bad idea in and of itself (because it's not the timing of the shampoo that's wrong after all), you might just go for it. slip into the sheets with your hair still damp from the wash. A bad reflex that could harm your hair health on multiple levels.\\nYou have certainly noticed it after going to bed with wet hair, in the morning it has generally taken bad folds during the night and sometimes displays a few frankly unsightly spikes. Blame it on the movement of your hair while drying in the open air overnight, with your head pressed against the pillow. And that's not to mention the lengths, which are also often more tangled ... Suffice to say that in the morning, the hair is almost indomitable and not really at its peak. Finally, the time saved by not drying your hair the night before is quickly lost when you wake up when you have to try to correct the situation with brushing or styling products. And this is far from the worst consequence of this habit.\\nYou may not know it, but when your hair is wet, the scales that make up the hair's cuticle (its outer, protective layer) are loosened and lifted, making the hair more brittle. So porous, the hair fiber is also more sensitive to external aggressions (temperature variations, friction against the pillow, etc.) and therefore more prone to knots, which consequently also makes it more prone to breakage. It’s better not to keep your lengths wet or worse: soaked, before going to bed.\\nIf you may appreciate the cool effect of wet hair on the pillow, know that sleeping with your hair still soaked after shampooing will generate humid heat which is very conducive to the development of yeast infections and fungi. on your scalp. In fact, when you sleep with your head resting against the pillow, this moisture present in the hair and on the scalp will simply macerate against a sheet which is itself a nest of bacteria. This disrupts the balance of the scalp by making it more sensitive to irritation, more prone to dandruff and itching, but also to fungi.\\nSo many good reasons to stop going to bed with wet hair!\",\n",
       " 'In this blog I look at what a flashover is, why flashovers are damaging to the overhead catenary system, why finding them is vital to run a reliable railway and how we can find them faster and more accurately using new detection techniques.\\nElectrified railways are more reliable than their fossil fuelled counterparts. However, when a fault occurs with the overhead catenary / overhead line equipment (OHLE), or in 3rd rail electrification, serious disruption and delays occur as rollingstock is stranded until the necessary repairs, inspection and re-energisation of the affected section are complete.\\nDewirement of overhead catenary is one of the most serious types of incident from both safety, and traffic disruption viewpoints. Dewirement is where the overhead contact wire falls, or is pulled, down onto the train/track beneath. A dewirement above or in front of a train travelling at speed can lead to several kilometres of overhead catenary being damaged due to the long stopping distances of the train and the length of the tensioned catenary sections.\\nRepairs can take many hours or in some cases even days to complete.\\nSource: Trenvista - The independent magazine of the railway sector\\nWhat is an electrical flashover?\\nAn electrical flashover is a high energy electrical discharge that occurs when an energized conductor comes into contact or close enough to another conductor to generate a spark. If this spark contains enough power to generate a plasma a flashover occurs. Plasma is a state of matter that is ionized, meaning that it has lost some or all its electrons. When a flashover occurs, the high-voltage discharge ionizes the air, creating a plasma. Plasma is a very good conductor of electricity and carries electrical current from the energized conductor typically to ground or another conductor.\\nWhy is a flashover damaging to the catenary?\\nThe plasma created by a flashover is extremely hot, reaching temperatures of several thousand degrees Celsius. This intense heat can cause damage to equipment, ignite fires and cause burns to nearby people. Where the flashover contacts components the intense heat can melt and cause material to be removed, weakening it, and causing failure.\\nRailway OHLE power supply systems have fault detection systems to cut the power when such issues occur, however they cannot act instantly so some material damage is inevitable where a flashover occurs. These damaged locations introduce potential weak points to catenary components which may lead to failure in the future reducing its long-term reliability.\\nIn cases where a fault is not automatically detected, the components such as wires can be quickly melted through leading to a dewirement causing further significant infrastructure damage as well as the obvious safety implications of live conductors falling from overhead.\\nHow do we find flashover faults and why is it important?\\nConventionally identifying electrical flashover faults relies on manual visual inspection. If a section of catenary trips due to a fault, the section is inspected to find it. Depending on the equipment installed and procedure requirements a portion or sometimes even the entire section may require inspection. Using conventional power fault detection equipment, the fault location can be estimated to several hundred meters, in ideal conditions – often significantly more. Where this equipment is not fitted, if the entire section needs inspecting, which may be many kilometres in length, perhaps 20km, this takes considerable time and resources to achieve. If inspections are carried out at night, as is common, then the job becomes even more challenging with many inspections revealing “No fault found”.\\nSome faults like a fallen tree may be quite easy to spot. Smaller transient faults caused by birds or a foreign object contacting the catenary can be challenging, if not near impossible to find, as the evidence can be vapourised by the flashover event. Often the only signs are scorch marks on the structure or component.\\nIt is important to pinpoint the location of the flashover to give inspections the best chance to find the source of the fault. The fault could be an issue likely to recur in future, or the damage caused by the flashover may lead to reliability issues in the future, e.g., arc damage to a wire leading to future wire break or dewirement.\\nThere is now a better way to accurately locate flashover events, saving time, avoiding disruption, improving reliability, and increasing worker safety.\\nHow can we find flashover faults faster and more reliably?\\nFlashover events are highly energetic, generating significant noise and vibration, for a hopefully very brief period. Sensonic utilises vibration sensing via fibre optics, to detect these vibrations and record them for analysis.\\nThis allows Sensonic to remotely locate the flashover to within 10m before anyone needs to set foot onto the track.\\nThis accurate location allows inspection and repairs teams to be dispatched directly to the incident site delivering multiple benefits:\\n- Improves response and recovery times\\n- Improves OHLE team productivity by reducing inspection times\\n- Improves safety by reducing time on track\\n- Improves future catenary reliability by finding faults that would often be missed\\nWant to know more about locating catenary flashovers? See our flashover location application pages or get in touch.\\nWhat causes a catenary flashover?\\nMany factors can contribute to an electrical flashover, including:\\n- High voltage: The higher the voltage, the more likely it is that an electrical flashover will occur. Railway electrification starts at 750V, and many catenary systems are energised with up to 25,000 Volts.\\n- Insulation: Insulation helps to prevent electrical current from flowing from one conductor to another. If insulation is damaged, it can increase the risk of an electrical flashover. As air is often used as an insulator, correct air gaps must be maintained.\\n- Contaminants: Contaminants, such as dirt, dust, or moisture, can weaken the insulation and increase the risk of an electrical flashover.\\n- Weather: High winds, rain, and snow can decrease air insulation gaps and decrease effectiveness of insulators. Hot temperatures or excess ice accumulation can cause the wires to sag.\\n- Foreign objects encountering the catenary, e.g., trees, birds or objects blown by the wind\\n- Damage to the catenary: Damage from collision or vandalism can degrade insulators or displace components decreasing air insulation gaps.\\n- Pantograph faults: Damaged units on trains can cause collision damage as above.\\n- Degradation of components: Over time, mechanical components can deteriorate, corrode or fatigue resulting in failure leading to an insufficient air/insulation gap.\\n- Vandalism or cable theft\\nThe different electrification voltages across Europe\\nEurope rail electrification en - Railway electrification - Wikipedia\\nA typical flashover timeline\\nDifferent railways have different procedures and regulations around catenary traction power faults, however many have an inspection requirement, even if the original fault is only a temporary one. Inspection after a fault has occurred is vital to assess the damage caused and avoid future more serious events occurring in future. If inspection is not triggered or not carried out opportunity to improve the reliability of the catenary system is missed.\\nThe inspection process can be significantly improved if the location of a flashover can be accurately determined. This both reduces the inspection time and allows a more thorough inspection of the suspect components to be carried out.\\nTo find out more about how we can direct your teams straight to catenary flashover faults contact us.',\n",

       " 'Jesse Vallins is a native of Toronto and has spent the last 12 years working in some of the city’s best restaurants. He has spent the last four years as the chef at Trevor Kitchen and Bar (38 Wellington Street East).\\nWhat inspired you to become a chef?\\nFor as long as I can remember I’ve fallen asleep and woken up thinking about food. I love eating and sharing food with people and the experience of restaurants. I don’t care if it’s Canoe (66 Wellington Street West) or a dive in Chinatown, all restaurants are as much about experience as eating. I’ve always loved that and wanted to be a part of it.\\nWhat is your favourite dish at the restaurant where you cook and why?\\nThe bacon and tomato salad with avocado ranch and crispy shallots. I love it because it’s got a great mix of different flavours and textures that really work together…and it’s absolutely lousy with bacon.\\nThree ingredients you couldn’t live without and why?\\nAs far as to cook with – salt, lemon and onions. You can’t go without salt or acid in cooking, and onions are just one of those things that end up in everything and they’re so versatile. I heard a great quote once that said “If truffles and onions cost the same amount of money, you would obviously choose an onion. You don’t need truffles; you do need onions.” As far as ingredients for eating – the three b’s of heathfood – bacon, butter and beer.\\nOn your day off – what are you cooking at home? If you’re eating out, where do you go?\\nWhen I cook at home I usually keep it pretty simple. I eat a lot of roast chicken and salad. When I eat out I mix it up and love trying new places. I go to Chinatown all the time on my days off. I live in Leslieville and I like to support places in my neighbourhood like Ruby Watchco (730 Queen Street East) and Table 17 (782 Queen Street East). I had a great meal at Scarpetta (550 Wellington Street West) recently, too. Otherwise my favourite places are Caplansky’s (356 College Street), The Patrician Grill (219 King Street East), The Black Hoof (928 Dundas Street West) and Colborne Lane (45 Colborne Street).\\nWhat is your favourite thing about the food scene in Toronto?\\nI think the best thing about the food scene in Toronto is our ethnic food. Especially in Kensington Market and Chinatown, I really think it’s world class. The sheer variety of the restaurants in general is great too.\\nWhat’s coming up?\\nTrevor Kitchen and Bar will be opening for lunch mid-September. We’ll also be taking part in Toronto Beer Week with some beer and food pairings.',\n",
       " 'Electronic data interchange (EDI) is one of the most intimidating and often avoided software tools in the world of order fulfillment services.\\nSMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) erroneously believe that EDI is either too expensive or too complicated to be worth the trouble, so instead insist on continuing to try to handle growing commercial orders with a basic shopping cart or worse, manually over the telephone or fax. The truth is that EDI can actually open your business to better opportunities and an increased cash flow with little extra input if you apply it correctly.\\nThe Many Parts EDI Plays in Supply Chain Management\\nEDI plays such an important part in the supply chain that it can’t be ignored. Once you have access to EDI, you’ll see just how much it can do for you. EDI is about efficiency, order accuracy and saving man-hours.\\nHere are some of the more common roles it plays in supply chain management:\\nAllowing full order automation. When your orders come in over a fax or through email and then you have a person who transfers them into a piece of order management software, it may not seem like you’re creating a lot of extra work, but when you look at the hours involved it really adds up. EDI can be used in part to fully automate your workflows, including transferring the same order your staff needs an hour to handle manually in mere seconds.\\nPreventing order errors. Eliminating the human element as much as possible is the key to increasing your order accuracy exponentially. Although some customers may understand that your people are “only human,” you’ve never heard anyone mutter “to err is to be a computer.” When you use EDI to front end your order fulfillment, you’ll discover that the only place that’s left for mistakes is in the warehouse, where orders are checked and checked again to help reduce human error.\\nHandling all the communication with buyers and suppliers. In addition to handling order taking, an EDI can help with the additional communication you typically handle manually. From confirming orders to confirming changes and sending final order acknowledgements, advanced shipping notifications and invoicing, an EDI system can be put in charge of all the busy work.\\nEDI is an invaluable tool for SMBs hoping to work with larger outlets that require substantial orders. It’s just another way that you can do a lot more with limited staff. The reduced overhead can really help to increase your bottom line.',\n",
       " 'Davenport Attorneys For Trust Administration\\nThe administration of a trust is a serious and potentially complex responsibility. Many people who are named as trustees have never served in such a role. Successfully carrying out all of the duties of a trustee can be difficult. Securing experienced counsel is the best way to ensure that you fulfill your fiduciary obligations as a trustee.\\nAt Schnell & Hancock, P.C., our Davenport and Rock Island lawyers understand how overwhelming it can be to be named as a trustee. With more than 40 years of combined experience, we are able to help our clients successfully fulfill their duties, no matter the level of complexity. Our firm is committed to providing the full support a trustee needs at all stages of the trust administration process.\\nSkilled Guidance On The Effective Administration Of A Trust\\nTrust administration is somewhat similar to estate administration or the probate process. A trustee is usually responsible for the following (among other duties):\\n- Statutory notices for beneficiaries and creditors\\n- Tax return preparation\\n- Re-titling of assets\\n- Distribution of assets\\n- Investment management\\n- Selling assets\\nOur firm provides practical guidance to our clients to feel comfortable and confident acting as trustee. Our understanding of the legal and practical requirements of the role of trustee helps ensure that our clients are fully aware of their responsibilities. We work with our clients for as long as is necessary, until the trust administration is complete.\\nProviding Advice Concerning Beneficiary Distributions\\nMany trusts provide for ongoing administration, after the death of the grantor, for the benefit of the named beneficiaries. The trustee must determine if and when a beneficiary should receive a distribution (within the trustee’s discretion). Until the trustee is permitted to make final and complete distribution of the trust, the trustee must weigh the wishes of the grantor (also known as the creator of the trust) against the beneficiary’s desire for a distribution. We can help you understand the practical and legal duties of an effective trustee.\\nContact Our Lawyers If You Have Been Named As A Trustee\\nFor effective trust administration assistance, turn to the attorneys of Schnell & Hancock, P.C.

       " 'Having stinky feet can be an embarrassing and confidence-damaging issue. The smell is often hard to conceal and can make you dread taking your shoes off in front of others. Fortunately, with the right foot hygiene regimen, anyone can learn how to get rid of stinky feet for good. This article outlines the underlying causes of smelly feet and provides useful tips and solutions to eliminate foot odor permanently.\\nWhat Causes Stinky Feet?\\nWhen your feet start to smell unpleasant, the likely culprit is bacteria. Our feet contain more sweat glands per square inch than any other part of the body. When feet sweat, which is perfectly normal and healthy, the moisture gets trapped against the skin by socks and shoes. This warm, damp environment encourages bacteria to thrive.\\nAs the bacteria rapidly multiply, they start to break down sweat into acids. These acids produce the unpleasant smells we associate with unpleasant foot odor. Certain feet are more prone to sweating and developing bacteria than others due to genetic factors. However, with diligent hygiene, even the sweatiest feet can be odor-free.\\nTips to Get Rid of Smelly Feet\\nPractice Proper Hygiene\\nThe first step is thoroughly washing and drying your feet daily. Use a mild antibacterial soap and wash between the toes where moisture and bacteria tend to accumulate. After washing, dry feet carefully, especially between the toes. Remaining dampness encourages bacterial overgrowth.\\nFoot soaks are an easy way to clean feet, kill bacteria and soften calluses. Combine a basin of warm water with antifungal ingredients like apple cider vinegar, black tea, sage or essential oils like eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree. Soak feet for 15-20 minutes daily to reduce foot odor.\\nGently sloughing off dead skin cells keeps feet fresh. Use a foot scrub or pumice stone to exfoliate while soaking feet to remove calluses and cleared clogged pores that can cause odor.\\nWear Moisture-Wicking Socks\\nWear socks made from moisture-wicking fabrics like wool, bamboo rayon, polyester, and spandex blends. These fabrics draw sweat away from feet to keep them dry and discourage bacterial growth. Change into a fresh pair halfway through the day if your feet are excessively sweaty.\\nUse Antiperspirant Spray\\nApplying an over-the-counter antiperspirant spray to clean feet and shoes can curb sweating and odor. Look for aluminum chloride as the active ingredient. Reapply daily, especially before exercising when sweat production increases.\\nGive your shoes at least 24 hours to fully dry out before wearing again. Rotate between different pairs to allow them to air out and reduce odor-causing moisture and bacteria buildup.\\nReplace Old Shoes and Socks\\nFabric shoes and socks develop odors over time and should be replaced every six months – or sooner if they smell unpleasant even after washing. Old, degraded materials allow for more bacterial growth. Invest in new supportive, breathable shoes and high-quality socks.\\nTry Antifungal Treatments\\nIf excessive foot sweating and odor persists, over-the-counter antifungal sprays, powders and creams can help. Products with miconazole or clotrimazole work to control fungi and bacteria. Apply twice daily, including between the toes until sweat and smells dissipate.\\nSee a Podiatrist or Dermatologist\\nFor severe, untreatable foot odor, make an appointment with a foot doctor or skin doctor. You may have a underlying condition like hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) or a fungal infection causing uncontrollable smells. Prescription-strength antiperspirants and antifungals are available to curb foot odor.\\nIf prescription treatments are not an option, try homemade foot odor remedies:\\n- Baking soda foot baths neutralize foot odor\\n- Dab apple cider vinegar between toes and let dry to kill bacteria\\n- Apply a thin layer of plain yogurt between toes before bed – the enzymes eat odor-causing particles\\n- Dust feet and shoes with cornstarch or baby powder to absorb moisture\\n- Place tea bags soaked in vinegar in shoes overnight to absorb odors\\nWith discipline, the right footwear and consistent hygiene, you can say goodbye to smelly feet for good. Don’t let foot odor diminish your confidence. Implement these dermatologist-recommended tips today to keep your feet fresh, healthy and odor-free all year long.',\n",
       " 'It is Kokoda season – the key months, after winter sports finals, when scores of Australians make the pilgrimage to Papau New Guinea and the Kokoda Track.\\nDespite politicians of all different sizes and ages having walked the track – I quickly discovered it is not easy or without danger.\\nSome have died on the walk, many others are injured or suffer from dehydration and heat exhaustion over the nearly 100-kilometre mountainous climb.\\nThere are slips, trips and even cases of trench foot with sodden boots.\\nMy first wake-up call came soon after arriving at the Holiday Inn Port Moresby on the eve of the trek. A guide arrived back at the hotel with broken ribs – forced to walk a chunk of the track in some pain after a bad fall at a creek crossing.\\n\"You should be right,\" others who had completed the journey tell us at the hotel. Little comfort as you go through your pack again trying to work out what you can dump to lighten the load.\\nDespite the extreme nature of the physical challenge, Australians are flocking to walk the Kokoda Track in their thousands. A plane crash a few years ago saw numbers plummet but they are on the way up again.\\nSome, including former prime minister Paul Keating, describe it as Australia\\'s most important military campaign, a series of battles that may have saved Australia from Japanese invasion.\\nFor some, the 96-kilometre track is a historical pilgrimage like the beaches of Gallipoli. They had read moving accounts from authors such as Peter Brune in Those Ragged Bloody Heroes, or Peter FitzSimons\\'s Kokoda.\\nFor others, it is a challenge to raise money for charity. I felt deep admiration for the group of 30 women we passed in belting rain, dressed in pink and struggling on the steep muddy slopes, determined to finish and raise money for breast cancer.\\nAnd then for some it is the pure physical challenge, the fitness junkies, those who like to push themselves.\\nFor me, it was a combination of the history and the physical challenge. What finally motivated me to do it, after years of talking about it, was a surprise ticket from family and friends for my 40th birthday.\\nOur group of about a dozen was a combination of all of the above, men, women, even a teenager with his dad, all different backgrounds, an accurate reflection of the eclectic mix of walkers on the track.\\nYou don\\'t have to be super fit, just determined!\\nAfter shaking off nerves from the trekking stories of those back at the hotel, we flew out early for Popondetta on the north coast of Papua New Guinea.\\nIt was then a four-hour bumpy truck ride to the Kokoda plateau and the famous Kokoda airstrip.\\nWe started in the north and headed south, retracing in chronological order the key battles. Others begin closer to Port Moresby and head north. It matters little, same mountain to climb.\\nFrom the Kokoda airstrip the track meanders through plantations before tackling the first climb up the range.\\n\"How easy is this,\" you think to yourself.\\nAnd then you hit the first climb.\\nNervous banter is replaced by puffing and spluttering, slips and trips. You realise what quadriceps are for and that 96 kilometres is a really long way.\\nI found the extreme humidity suffocating, especially given one of our Sunday morning training walks was in freezing temperatures up Mount Donna Buang on the outskirts of Melbourne.\\nOur first break is at the picturesque village of Deniki, which consisted of several huts solely used by trekkers with a small grass area and expansive views of the valley and airstrip below.\\nAs you kick back, boots off, cup of tea in hand and gaze out towards the distant airstrip, there is a feeling of living an important part of Australian history.\\nIt is an amazing spot. The thunderstorms rolling in maximise the impact of the indelible scene.\\n\"I am really walking the famous Kokoda Track\"\\nFrom Deniki it is arduous hills most of the way, with steep declines to creeks followed by sharp climbs up the other side.\\nThe slope comes to meet you on Kokoda and your hands – grabbing roots and rocks to pull yourself up – become as important as your feet in navigating the steep track.\\nWhile the mountains are not enormous, the highest point of Mount Bellamy is only 2200 metres, but its rises and falls make the 96 kilometres seem much longer. Add the sauna-like humidity and the belting rain that turns the track into slippery-slide and there is enough to keep you challenged.\\nOur next stop, Eora Creek, was the scene of heavy fighting on the Japanese retreat, and is also a spectacular camping site in the Owen Stanley Range, with the gushing creek surrounded by verdant jungle on all sides.\\nThe swim in the creek at the end of a long day\\'s walk is one of the most relaxing I can remember.\\nA hearty hot meal served up by the porters who are excellent bush cooks is soon followed by bed.\\nYou sleep well on Kokoda, a deep exhausted sleep, only broken by the 5am wake up call to begin walking again at 6am.\\nThe days can be long\\nDo the track in 10 days and you can generally walk about six hours a day. Do it in six and you walk 10.\\nWe did it in six.\\nThere are plenty of stops along the way and the constant call of \"water up\", meaning you take a long suck from the two-litre water sack strapped to your pack.\\nThere were days where it felt like all I did was walk, drink and duck off behind a tree for a toilet break.\\nThose who do the majority of work on most treks are the local Papuan porters who accompany you.\\nWhile trekkers carry clothes, sleeping bags and medical supplies, the porters carry tents, food, pots and pans.\\nWhile trekkers carry 15 kilograms, porters carry in excess of 20 kilograms, some a lot more.\\nNot only do they carry more, often in bare feet, they also do a lot more work.\\nThe porters cook all meals and set up and dismantle tents and even scurry ahead of trekkers to set up bridge crossings at the dozens of creeks, dry out tents and cook hot meals before the trekkers arrive.\\nThe porters are also full of good advice.\\nDuring one stop I ventured off towards the nearest tree for a quick toilet break. One shy guide said something in muffled pidgeon and I just smiled and waved. \"yes, thank you\".\\nWhat I quickly discovered was that he said, \"don\\'t go there, stinging nettles\".\\nI returned in pain and to sounds of laughter.\\nThe ingenuity of the porters is amazing, building bridges quickly at creek crossings and then dismantling them and speeding on to the next creek.\\nAt the swollen Goldie River, they chopped down a 20-metre tree to make a bridge, only to see it wash away in the strong current.\\nOne porter then swam the fast-flowing river and tied a rope to the other bank – we all swam across clinging to the rope with the help of a porter.\\nThe track is no stroll through a national park\\nDeath is everywhere on the Kokoda Track. The big battle sites, the hidden jungle tombs and even the discreet crosses on the jungle\\'s edge for the several travellers who have perished along the way.\\nThe porters are always there to watch your safety. If you look off balance a hand suddenly appears to help. And the guides remind you to keep drinking plenty of fluids, eat enough and tend to jungle wounds. As one of our guides noted, \"all you have to do is walk\".\\nWalking is still tough.\\nThe rain, creeks and mud soak boots to the point chunks of skin peel off water logged toes like onion skin.\\nBlisters are a given. And if you are too proud to wear lycra bike shorts as some members of our party chose to do (yes, I was one of them) you can expect a nice blend of chafe and sweat rash.\\nMosquitoes and potent malaria strains are also a constant threat.\\nThen there are the hills.\\nOne day\\'s walk includes the \"eight false peaks\" – enough said.\\nFrom the north coast the track takes you across the Owen Stanley Range to the back door of Port Moresby at Owen\\'s Corner. The Japanese soldiers could see the lights of Port Moresby, their objective, when ordered to retreat.\\nAside from the physical challenge of Kokoda, there is the mental challenge.\\nEvery hill you walk, every corner you turn, there are signs of battle. Abandoned fox holes, stories of those who died. It is hard to imagine the strain on the soldiers not sure what was over the next hill or in the jungle beside them. It is hard enough walking the track without the fear of imminent death.\\nThere are tears from the stories of those who fought and died, including for Butch Bissett who died in his brother Stan\\'s arms at the famous battle of Isurava. Stan sat with his brother for several hours as the battle raged around them and told him stories of their childhood to comfort Butch in his last hours. As you pass the quiet rock where Butch died it is hard to keep it together.\\nThen there is the story of Corporal John Metson, who was shot through the foot and the crawled for weeks through the harsh jungle rather than allow his mates to be burdened carrying him. He was later executed by the Japanese.\\nAs you near the end of the track and a week of solid hiking, dozens of creek crossings and litres of sweat – it all seems worth it.\\nYou forge a strong bond with the other walkers, the guides and porters. There is also a connection with others you meet back home who have walked the track.\\nWalking through the arch at the end is a moment you will never forget.\\nUnlike many iconic destinations around the world, Kokoda is yet to be touched by commercialism. There are no souvenirs outside the experience.\\nAt Kokoda you will learn a little about Australia\\'s military history and much more about yourself. What your mind and body will endure.\\nOther holidays and overseas trips will fade, Kokoda you will never forget.\\nWhat you need to know\\nWalks from 6-10 nights. The quicker the trek, the longer the days. More days are not necessarily easier because they mean more time in the jungle.\\n- Carry your pack or pay a porter to carry it for you. You will still need to carry a few litres of water so don\\'t think there is no weight on your back. If it is the difference between doing the trek or not, pay the porter.\\n- I went with a combined No Roads and Earth Sea Sky trip. Fantastic tour leaders, porters and excellent cooked food. Pack and water sack supplied.\\n- Cost is between $4000 to $6000 including flights. You won\\'t need a lot of spending money, maybe a couple of hundred dollars.\\n- 12 weeks training recommended and provided by trekking companies.\\n- You don\\'t have to be a marathon runner to do it. All ages and sizes walk the track. Determination is what gets you to the other end.\\n- Travel injections: there are not many you don\\'t need for PNG and malaria tablets are a must.\\n- Apart from a few changes in direction, the condition of the track is much like what the Australian soldiers experienced in 1942, apart from the fact no one is shooting at you.\\n- The best months to walk Kokoda are April to November, when the rivers are passable – even by October the rain can make the Goldie River crossing close to Port Moresby a swim, rather than a walk.\\n- Good walking boots and clean socks for each day are a must. I went heavy duty, base-camp-type boots. Lighter, hybrid-style hiking boots would have been better.\\nSign up for the Traveller Deals newsletter\\nGet exclusive travel deals delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up now.',\n",

       " 'When three close friends from Spokane, Washington started crocheting unique headwear for snow sports in high school and college, the idea for a revolutionary non-profit company was born. Kohl Crecelius, Stewart Ramsey, and Travis Hartanov were dubbed the “krochet kids” by their local newspaper when they started taking custom orders and selling their crocheted beanies. Encouraged by family and friends to teach people in developing countries how to crochet as a means of breaking the cycle of poverty, they set out to change the world.\\nDuring summer breaks in college, the founders volunteered in various developing nations, hoping to gain a better understanding of the issues facing the global community. When Stew returned home from a summer spent in Uganda, he explained how people he met had been living in government camps for over 20 years due to a rebel army that had ravaged the north part of the country. There were entire generations growing up only knowing the camp, relying solely on the government and aid organizations for their every need. These people were yearning for independence from these operating bodies and wanted to be able to work and provide for their own families.\\nWith the incorporation of close friends who shared the desire to see Northern Uganda transformed by hook and yarn, Krochet Kids applied to become a non-profit organization. The following summer, this passionate crew found themselves sitting in a brick hut with a group of Ugandan women and bags full of yarn. As the ladies nearly mastered this craft before their very eyes, the tears started to flow.\\nToday, there are over 200 people in Uganda and Peru working, receiving education, and being mentored toward a brighter future in creating Krochet Kids intl. goods that give back.

       " 'My name is Sarah and this is my story of surviving domestic abuse.\\nWe met through mutual friends. I was working as a drugs and alcohol counsellor, delivering group workshops to rehabilitate those in recovery. He was a former drug addict who had committed to a programme and felt it had changed him as a person. I always believed in giving people second chances and admired how far he had come.\\nI ended up working in this area because my mum was an alcoholic and I couldn’t save her. As a child I lived in a home with severe domestic violence and to cope with it all my mother turned to alcohol, drinking all day just to feel normal. My dad would come home and smash up the door, throw bottles at the wall, and consistently beat my mum to the point where I would have to lie on top of her to stop him from killing her. It was intensely stressful environment to grow up in, never knowing when he would lose it, always worrying about her safety.\\nWhen I was eighteen my mum committed suicide. It devastated me and left me feeling very vulnerable. I began drinking a lot, thinking about the violence that she had suffered. Luckily I had access to counselling and rebuilt my life, creating for myself a normal and calm environment with a stable relationship and two children.\\nWhen this relationship broke down, I found myself single and I didn’t like being alone. This was when I met him.\\nA gentle giant, he was handsome and charming and took such an interest in me. As a child, my parents never asked where I was, it was always me trying to find them. Suddenly to have someone ask me where I am, what am I doing – I thought he must really care about me. He would ring me all the time to check where I was, what I was up to, or who I was with.\\nI identified with his story too. His mum had also been an alcoholic and he had been put into care as a child. He had a terrible childhood, and much injustice had happened to him. When I fell pregnant with my son he became much more controlling, verbally abusive and frustrated. I started to make excuses for his lack of trust in me, rationalising that this was because of his childhood.\\nThe first time he hit me was after my son was born. I was holding him and then suddenly there it was. I was shocked. Once that happened, it happened all the time. He would strangle me, pull out my hair, smash things around the house. He was sexually violent, coercing me into doing things I didn’t want to do so he wouldn’t wake the children up. He would say he would never do it again, but he would again and again. I felt so out of control of my own body, my own life.\\nI still made excuses however, minimizing my experiences by refusing to equate my violence with that of my mum’s. My mum had her blood spattered on the wall, broken bones.\\nI fell pregnant again and then the violence escalated once more. I felt that I was constantly walking on eggshells. I couldn’t do anything right. The food I cooked was too hot or too cold. My body was too fat or too thin. He never thought I looked after the children enough. He would blame me for the abuse, saying that I provoked him, blame me for the police coming because I screamed.\\nI started to experience severe panic attacks. Each time I would go to hospital they didn’t pick up on bruises around my neck, they didn’t act. I only wish they had brought in other services. Each time I would call police nothing was taken any further. I didn’t feel confident that the system would protect me.\\nThe day I told him I was going to leave him, he flew into a rage, broke my ribs and ruptured my spleen. On arrival at the hospital they found internal bleeding, stating had I come twenty minutes later I might have died. He followed me there and whispered in my ear that if I told them what happened he would break my other ribs too. I couldn’t speak, couldn’t shout as I had to stay really still to receive my blood transfusion. It was terrifying.\\nInstead I told the hospital that I had fallen off one of the children’s bunk beds. The consultant was not easily fooled and said I was lying, that either I had been beaten up or been in a car accident, such were the severity of my injuries. I was forced to tell the truth, and social services stepped in. He was arrested but given bail, which made me nervous. Luckily he was soon arrested for an unrelated drugs charge and was put away. He would ring me from jail threatening to kill me, but it was a real sense of relief knowing that he couldn’t.\\nThis was when social services put me in touch with Solace Women’s Aid, which really changed my life. My self-esteem was so low due to the daily abuse. He had blamed me so much that there was a part of me that really believed it was my fault. Solace showed me it wasn’t. My caseworker was so nice. She sorted everything out for me, how to get benefits, grants to pay for school uniforms, access to children’s services, even a babysitter. When I had my first job interview Solace helped me go to a place where I could get the right clothes to wear. It was like having a family around me that could help me rise out of the ashes and come back to life.\\nThen I started accessing parenting groups and workshops which changed everything. It was like going to a university of recovery. Being with people who have all been through what you have, it was so understanding and supportive.\\nMy own children were traumatised by witnessing the abuse, and to this day have issues with behaviour, relationships and trust. My youngest son was so anxious at just five years old, he would ask me to get off the bus if he perceived danger. I want to emphasise how important it is that children get the help they need. When you witness domestic abuse as a child it has a massive impact. It affected me, and it continues to affect my children. We need to make schools aware, to train teachers, to put the right support services in place. I am so thankful that my son benefitted from play therapy at Solace, it has made him better able to express himself.\\nThe first month he was released from prison he was spotted near my house and arrested. He was demanding access to the children and I was so nervous about what might happen. Solace helped me with the process to obtain a prohibitive steps order, preventing him from ever contacting the children again. It was an amazing result, and their support right through from speaking to lawyers to appearing in family court – it changed my life and the life of my children’s.\\nI am in a place where I am no longer scared of him or his family anymore. I feel confident and empowered to build a better future. I am not ashamed anymore. I want to tell anyone who is going through this or who is struggling in the aftermath, it does get better. You must talk about it, that’s the first step. Tell anyone you feel safe to speak to. Anyone. To all the women who have walked away without support, the trauma is still affecting you. Seek help, there are so many services available.\\nI am really lucky that my children and I got the help we needed from Solace. It felt like a tsunami had come into my life and smashed us to pieces, and we were recovering piece by piece. Instead of turning to alcohol to cope I turned my life around. Solace brought up my self-worth and reminded me of my strength, that there is life after abuse.',\n",

       " 'I don\\'t really like using classical music for evaluating systems under show conditions. The environment\\'s generally too noisy to flatter the high dynamic range and delicacy of well-recorded symphonic music. And baroque is just too precious for me to take seriously for anything other than brunch in a quaint bistro. So it\\'s usually jazz for me unless I feel like clearing a room, at which point Mr. Bungle or Tomahawk usually does the trick.\\nWhen I walked into the room shared by YG Acoustics and Jones Audio, an Indiana Jones-hatted gent was sitting in the sweet spot chatting with one of the reps. The system was pounding out an absolutely monstrous symphonic piece. This music didn\\'t bother with dynamic range, as it sounded like the needle was pinned at 0dB. It was aggressive and angry, and I just loved it.\\nI also knew this piece, but I couldn\\'t place it. It wasn\\'t Holst\\'s \"Mars,\" that\\'s for sure, although it had some similarity. I butted into the conversation and asked the man what was playing, and he told me it was \"The Battle\" from the Gladiator soundtrack. Aha. Now I knew why I was seeing blood and swords in my mind\\'s eye.\\nThe music perfectly suited the armor-plated YG Acoustics Anat Reference II Studios, which retail for a princely $74,000 per pair. Despite the show conditions, the music was turned up so bloody loud that the small amount of dynamic range it contained just propelled sound out into the room. The Anats kept up with the volume, sounding clean and clear despite how hard they were being pushed.\\nFeeding the Anats were Jones Audio components. This company\\'s new to me, but based on the sound they were getting out of the YG speakers, they merit further investigation. The PA-M300 mono amps go for $28,000 per pair (shown above), while the PRE-S-1 preamp will set you back another $14,000. A Marantz SA-7S1 CD player fed the music in.\\nWhether this system sounded good with music played back at a reasonable level, I just don\\'t know. And frankly I don\\'t much care. Listening to \"The Battle\" was a real treat, and I left the room with that memory unsullied.\\nSometimes you just need the right piece of music at the right time.\\nSenior Contributor, The SoundStage!

       " 'Looking for a safari-plus in Hluhluwe Umfolozi Park, South Africa?\\nSouth Africa has been my home for the rest of my life since I was born here. South Africa is vast and dynamic, some even call it a world in one country. Hluhluwe Umfolozi Park is the oldest and the first wildlife game reserve proclaimed in 1895. Initially it was Hluhluwe game reserve and later majored with the Imfolozi game reserve and it became a national park. One of the richest wildlife sanctuaries in Africa. This hidden gem of South Africa has been the most successful reserve on the war against rhino poaching and being in the middle of Swaziland and Isimangaliso Wetland Park (St Lucia) and three hours away from King Shaka International Airport, Durban it is easily accessible to nature lovers.\\nThe park lost more than 20 rhinos between 2017/18, devastating since the park has been doing very well for the past decades. The number of rhinos killed is less compare to the Kruger National Park which is loosing hundreds of rhinos yearly because of poaching. The rhino poaching is an ongoing war, but there is a hope. If all South Africans can contribute on the rhino poaching programs, the problem will be under control and our next generation will see the endangered rhinos.\\nThe villages close to the park are fascinating for international travelers, culture and life style is total different. The Nompondo village cultural walk with a local guide, Mdu worth a visit. The Zulu tribe is the main tribe even though there are other small tribes (Amathonga, for example) in the eastern part of the province. Mdu, the local guide led us into one of the homestead and explaining everything about the Zulu lifestyle. “There is no fence or gate but you cant just enter someones home without the permission”, Mdu said. “Sikhulekile ekhaya” Mdu shouted twice before someone appears and said “ngenani” meaning come in. We entered the house and got seated accordingly, man on the right side and women on the left side. The whole tour took us three hours but the experience was unforgettable and fascinating at the same time. Hluhluwe is one of the hidden gems of South Africa and I highly recommend to any traveler.',\n",

       " 'Liverpool confirmed the signing of Preston North End centre-back Ben Davies on deadline day, as Jurgen Klopp looks to remedy his defensive injury crisis.\\nThe Reds tried out their 12th different centre-back pairing in the recent 3-1 win over West Ham on Sunday, with Jordan Henderson partnering Nat Phillips to see off the Hammers in the Premier League.\\nAsked about the potential incoming of Davies at the London Stadium, Klopp remained tight-lipped but confessed his “eyes are always open”, before praising the defensive heroics of Phillips and Henderson.\\nHe said: “Phillips played a decent game and Milly [James Milner] shouted at Hendo [Jordan Henderson] ‘you better be careful, if you play like this you’ll play there for the rest of his career’.”\\nOn Sky Sports commentary for the West Ham encounter, Gary Neville also name-dropped Javier Mascherano when discussing Henderson’s recent defensive showings. The Argentine, formerly of Liverpool, famously made the transition from holding midfielder to ball-playing centre-back, and Henderson could follow a similar trajectory.\\nBut the Reds required surefire reinforcements, with Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and now Joel Matip long-term absentees, while Fabinho is also currently sidelined, which may explain the club’s late move for Preston’s Davies.\\nThe deal for Davies saw unheralded teenager Sepp van den Berg go the other way on loan, doubling up as a very astute piece of business, while Schalke central defender Ozan Kabak also arrived.\\nBut, what exactly can Liverpool fans expect from Davies?\\n— Liverpool FC (@LFC) February 1, 2021\\nStyle of play\\nAt 6ft 1in, Davies is far from the most physically-imposing defender, but what he lacks in muscle mass he makes up for in other areas. The 25-year-old is a tidy left-footed centre-back and is renowned for his ability on the ball, as well as distribution, two essential attributes of a Liverpool defender.\\nHe’s composed in possession and makes ball-carrying runs from deep, a move regularly exhibited by Liverpool defenders. But, perhaps more importantly, his long-range distribution is one of his stronger areas, which bodes well when you have players like Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah making regular runs over the top.\\nSince the start of last season, Davies has completed 268 long-passes, which places him in the Championship’s top five for that particular metric among centre-backs. When you consider Liverpool have completed the third-most long-passes in the Premier League this season (615), it appears Klopp has done his homework.\\nThere may certainly be some scepticism that at 25, turning 26 in the summer, Davies is yet to make it out of the Championship, but one only has to look at Jamie Vardy, who didn’t make his Premier League introduction until his late 20s, as a perfect case study for reason to believe Davies can make the step up.\\nAnd at a reported £2m it really can’t be considered a significant risk to the champions’ coffers. Klopp has got himself one of the Championship’s most impressive and consistent centre-backs across the past four years, a defender who fits the Liverpool ball-playing mould, someone who provides greater squad depth, and all while seeing Van den Berg gain valuable experience the other way.\\nUnder sporting director Michael Edwards, Liverpool have proven assured and resourceful in the market since Klopp took the reins on Merseyside, and the Davies deal has the potential to be another Andrew Robertson-style signing, with the Scot joining from relegated Hull in 2017 for only £8m.',\n",

       " 'To enhance startup support and investment cooperation, South Korea and Saudi Arabia have announced the creation of a joint fund worth $160 million (approximately 208.4 billion won). The establishment of this fund is a follow-up measure to the “MOU for Investment Cooperation and Startup Support between South Korea and Saudi Arabia,” which was signed during a visit by Crown Prince Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to Korea in November of the previous year.\\nThe signing ceremony took place at the Crown Plaza Hotel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Minister Lee Young attended it from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups and Yousef Al Benyan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Saudi Small and Medium Business Bank. The joint fund was established by investing $10 million (13 billion won) in an existing fund worth $150 million (195.4 billion won), in which Saudi Arabia is a major investor. An additional $160 million (208.4 billion won) was raised, with participation from Saudi Venture Investment (SVC) and Saudi National Wealth Fund (PIF Jada).\\nThe two countries agreed to make mandatory investments of at least 10 million dollars in Korean companies through a joint fund. Minister Lee said,\\nUnder the agreement, the two countries have committed to making mandatory investments of at least $10 million in Korean companies through the joint fund. Minister Lee expressed optimism stating, “With the establishment of the Korea-Saudi Arabia joint fund as an opportunity, we will actively support Korean ventures and startups not only to attract investment but also to advance into Saudi Arabia. We will strive to become a key player in the Middle East.”\\nThis joint agreement comes after a series of efforts by Minister Lee, including visits to the Davos Forum and Saudi Arabia earlier this year, where he cultivated close cooperative ties with Saudi government officials, including the Minister of Investment.\\nThe joint fund aims to strengthen bilateral economic ties and create new opportunities for startups and entrepreneurs from both countries. Since President Yoon Seok-yeol assumed office, South Korea and Saudi Arabia have witnessed increased cooperation in various fields, including signing 26 investment contracts and memoranda of understanding through bilateral summits, fostering active exchanges in the realms of economy and culture.\\nMinister attends Riyadh Global Business Center for collaborations\\nMeanwhile, Minister Lee Young held a signboard-hanging ceremony at the Riyadh Front startup hub in Saudi Arabia.

       " 'The holidays are coming and it’s the perfect time of year to incorporate a little science into our holiday fun! What? You don’t think those two things go together? Well let me show you how you can inspire your older child to embrace the season with a STEAM activity I’m calling Circuit-Tree! This activity was inspired by our amazingly fun Circuit Bug activity.\\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links\\nFirst off, I need to pause for a moment and bask in the perfectness of the name of this project. You see what I did there, right?\\nOK, enough lovin’ of the name, let’s jump into how you can create your own awesomeness known as the Circuit-Tree!\\nSTEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math and this project is an excellent example of a STEAM project that incorporates all the elements. I recommend this project for children 8 years old and up. Please ensure appropriate safety precautions are taken and that adult supervision is used at all times.\\nBefore you do anything else you need to test your LED lights to make sure they work (and your battery for that matter). LED lights have one leg shorter than the other. The shorter leg is negative pin. Slide your round battery between the pins and hold the pins against the battery with your fingers. If the light doesn’t come on, turn the battery around and try again.\\nOnce you have all your LEDs working it is time to prepare your wires. Cut them to length, I went with twice the length of my clothespin as a guide. You will need two wires for each LED light. Now strip the ends of your wires. I went with a little less than an inch. I didn’t worry too much about being exact, the main idea is to not go too long as this could cause interruptions in your circuits.\\nThis next step can get very confusing very quickly, so it’s important to work systematically. Start by wrapping a wire around the short (positive pin) of an LED. Then repeat on another LED doing only positive pin. I found it easiest to do my LED’s in batches of two. So at this point I twisted the loose ends of those wires together. Now, just above the point where I stripped the wires I added a piece of electrical tape. That way throughout my build I always knew that the wires with electrical tape were my positives.\\nNow repeat the same wrapping process on those two LEDs but on the negative pins. Except after twisting together the loose ends do not add electrical tape. Make sense?\\nNow repeat on your next two LEDs.\\nOnce you have your LED’s wired I recommend testing them by placing your battery between your wire ends. Interruptions in your circuits are easy to do and you want to catch them early. If it doesn’t work, turn your battery around.\\nNext step, is to start building the tree. Start by taking one set of two LEDs and slide one LED on each leg of the clothespin. Make sure the positive pins are on the outside, negative (shorter pins on the inside), now carefully wrap electrical tape around the pins to hold the LED in place on the clothespin. Do this on both sides. Then test your LEDs. You want to make sure the pins are not touching any metal on the clothespin as this will interrupt your circuits.\\nTo add more lights I simply placed the next set of LEDs on the outside of the electrical tape. Then taped those into place. Test your LEDs!\\nOnce all your LEDs are attached to the clothespin and you have confirmed they are working you want to take your positive leads and wrap them all around one end of the clothespin bottom. Trim the wires and re-strip if necessary. Then repeat on the other side with the negative wires. Next, slide the battery in between so it is pinched into place with the wired held against the battery. This is really hard to do and takes some finesse. Adult help will likely be needed.\\nNow all your lights should be on! If you have lots of wires, you can use a little electrical tape to tuck them out of the way.\\nThis final stage is about having a bit of fun. Using pipecleaners wrap them around the clothespin to create your tree effect. I added a sparkly pipecleaner as garland on top of the green base. You may notice your lights flickering on and off as you build, just adjust if this happens, there is metal in the middle of pipecleaners which can cause a circuit interruption.\\nOnce your Circuit-tree is built you probably noticed it is not the most stable thing in the world and it looks funny with the battery and such sticking out the bottom. That is easily solved by building a Lego base to stand your tree up in! I used red 2×3 bricks and built the square base. It holds the tree perfectly and adds to the festive look.\\nI hope you enjoyed building your very own Circuit-Tree!\\nIf you enjoyed this Circuit-Tree project or just want more details on building circuits like this, check out my Circuit Bug activity and build your own bugs with glowing eyes!\\nFor more Christmas activities check out these other articles from STEAM Powered Family.',\n",

       " 'I was not expecting this, and I did not seek it out or order it. I didn’t even know it specifically existed although I have seen other similar items.

I just never needed to order any large quantity of them because pens are so common as takeaways and leave-behinds at shows and meetings.\\nSo, what makes this pen special? Aside from the fact that it actually looks attractive and feels good in my hand, and that it has the obligatory customization imprinted on the side (supposedly laser-engraved), it has a special tip that makes all the difference.

In fact, the stylus may be more important than the ink!\\nWe’re always looking for ways to promote our businesses and at the same time offer meaningful value to our clients, customers, and trade partners. That’s why food and drink don’t work so well. They are quickly consumed and forgotten. Typically pens don’t work either because they don’t even write long enough to get to the door.\\nAs far as getting a stylus to use for your phone or other device, I have seen them. It’s just that this combines the stylus with a pen – one that actually writes – and a branding message that people can carry with them until they lose it, break it, or get tired of it. For now, it seems like a good way to share a marketing and branding message.',\n",

Together we trust, hope, persevere and flourish on life’s great adventure.\\nOur vision, established through discussion and consultation over the last eighteen months, puts positive, productive relationships at the heart of everything that we do. We conducted some research and found out that St Paul wrote to the Corinthians about ‘love’, the integral component of all relationships, and how it protects, trusts, hopes and perseveres.\\nSt Paul wrote about what love is and what it is not and that without love we are nothing. Because of this, here at St Paul’s we promote positive relationships and facilitate honest and open communication between pupils, staff, parents and all other members of the school community. By establishing trusting, hopeful relationships and persevering to maintain these connections with one another, we will enable everyone to flourish on their journey and contribute positively to the lives of others.\\nOur ‘rainbow rules’ also link to this extract from the bible; just like love at St Paul’s we are patient, we are kind and we rejoice in the truth.\\nOur Core Values\\nOur pupils selected our Core Values of\\nLove-red, Courage-orange, Community- yellow, Forgiveness-green, Honesty-blue, Determination-Indigo, Respect- Violet\\nThese are the names of our seven family groups in school and we encourage our pupils to display these values throughout their daily lives.\\nHaving seven family groups in school enables us to have ‘Rainbow days’ where the pupils can spend special days learning with their school family of approximately 30 pupils.

       " '107-The Power of Low-End Products for Industry Leaders\\nLow-end products can save an industry’s bacon when the industry falls on hard times. Most low-priced products are what we call Price Leaders (see Audio Tip #83: Price Leader Products and Companies on StrategyStreet.com). These products offer less Function or Convenience than do the industry’s more important Standard Leader products, for common pricing savings of 25% or more. (See Audio Tip #81: Standard Leader Products and Companies on StrategyStreet.com.)\\nThese Price Leader products are helping the domestic beer industry today. In the domestic beer industry, Price Leader products are called “sub-premium brands.” These brands saw sales gains of 8% over the last year. In contrast, the industry Standard Leader products, called “premium” beers, saw sales fall 1.4%. “Sub-premium” beers are keeping the industry moving forward. These “sub-premium” beers cost about 25% less than the premium beers, so they offer drinkers an attractive price alternative when the economy gets tough.\\nMost of the “sub-premium” beer volumes are products of the big brewing companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, SABMiller PLC, Molson Coors Brewing Company. (See the Perspective, “When Product Mix Matters” on StrategyStreet.com.) So the industry’s Standard Leader competitors have closed the door on erstwhile Price Leader, private label, suppliers of cheaper brews.\\nThese Price Leader products also have a few cost advantages over the Standard Leader products. Most importantly, the big brewers rely on word-of-mouth and price-based impulse buys to generate sales. They spend very little on advertising these brands. On the other hand, they spend a great deal to advertise the “premium” Standard Leader brands. So, while profits are lower on the Price Leader products, the lower margins are nowhere in proportion to the lower prices these products seek.\\nFor the last 10 years, the beer industry in the US has been flat. Volume grew by 1% in total but sales grew only 0.1%. Despite the slow growth in the broader market, the number of breweries grew at a rate of nearly 13% from 2016 to 2020. The larger companies seem to have succeeded in shutting the door against new entrants at the low end of the market. Instead, virtually all of the growth in the market is taking place at the higher end, in brewpubs, microbreweries, and superpremium beers and ales. The major brewers have yet to figure out how to slow the newer high-end entrants. In this slow growing market, brewers are ramping up new product development to target fresh consumers. They are introducing hard seltzers, hard kombuchas, hard teas and coffees and CBD beverages, along with low alcohol and no alcohol beverages. These are examples of product proliferation in a challenging market.\\nBrewpubs, microbreweries and superpremium beers and ales are examples of Performance Leader products. These products compete on unique Functions.

       " 'Tom Hanks got his Oscar nomination for Big. The 1988 comedy was pivotal in making Hanks a proper movie star. Much of the success of this film, and therefore arguably Hanks’s whole career, comes from the mind of Paula Abdul. Here’s how she helped launch Hanks into superstardom.\\nTwo Stars On The Rise\\nBefore Big, Hanks spent about a decade trying to make it big. He landed a lead role in Bosom Buddies and subsequently got a guest spot on Happy Days. The programs turned the head of Ron Howard, who cast Hanks in Splash in 1984. The mermaid-based comedy became a surprise hit, setting him up to land a few more films over the next few years, like The Money Pit and Dragnet.\\nMeanwhile, Abdul was also getting her start in Los Angeles. A talented dancer, Abdul was plucked out of college to become one of the vaunted Laker Girls. She soon became the squad’s head choreographer before moving into the music video game.\\nAbdul befriended the Jacksons thanks to her Los Angeles Lakers connection and soon began doing choreography for the whole Jackson family. She laid out the dance moves for The Jackson’s huge Victory tour in 1984, and for smash hits like Janet Jackson’s “Nasty” and “Control.”\\nA Very Famous Scene\\nAbdul and Hanks’ paths crossed in Big. Abdul was the one responsible for choreographing the legendary giant keyboard dance routine with Hanks and Robert Loggia. Even if you haven’t seen the film, the scene made an indelible mark in popular culture. The likes of Homer Simpson and Peter Griffen would recreate the scene in years to come.\\nHanks gave Abdul immense credit. He told her, “My biggest claim to fame…is that you once choreographed me.” Considering Hanks was already racking up Academy Awards he said this, that is some high praise.\\nRest Is History\\nThe Penny Marshall-directed film went on to gross over $151 million over a budget of $18 million. While it scored Hanks his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor, but he would lose to Dustin Hoffman for Rain Man. No bother, as Hanks would pick up back-to-back statues in 1993 and 1994 for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump respectively, not to mention three more nominations in the years that followed his wins. It all worked out just fine for him.\\nLife only got better for Abdul as well. Within a year of Big, she scored three number one hits. About a decade later she became a star judge of the behemoth known as American Idol. To think everything really started looking up for Hanks and Abdul at the exact same moment.\\nMore News From Suggest',\n",

The Airbnb website gives the following tips:\\nAlways pay and communicate on Airbnb. Use Airbnb’s messaging system to get to know your guests and share expectations about the trip or your space.\\nRead profiles and reviews of your potential guests, and look for verified phone numbers, connected social networks, and references. If potential guests don’t have any profile verifications, you can ask them to complete some.\\nTrust your intuition: If you don’t feel right about a reservation, don’t accept it!\\nFill out your House Rules, Home Safety Card, and House Manual\\nCompleting your house rules and house manual helps guests know what to expect. Include anything you’d like people to know before they book—for example, whether (or where) smoking is allowed, whether certain areas are off-limits, your Wi-Fi password, or if guests should take off their shoes before coming inside.\\nIf a guest encounters an urgent or emergency situation, it's important they know who to call, what, and where to go. To help make this information clear and easy to display, all hosts will see the option to fill out a safety card online in the Home Safety tab of their listings. This card includes important information that hosts can provide guests, like emergency phone numbers, locations of fire extinguishers and fire alarms, and emergency exit routes.\\nMake sure you're insured\\nAirbnb's Host Protection Insurance program provides primary liability coverage for up to $1,000,000 per occurrence in the event of a third-party claim of bodily injury or property damage related to an Airbnb stay.\\nYou may also want to talk to your insurance provider about adding an extra layer of protection with your own renter’s or homeowner’s insurance.\\nSet requirements for your listing\\nYou can require guests to complete certain verifications before they book, such as Verified ID.\\nAdding a security deposit to your listing can also help protect you in the event of an accident, like spilled wine on a rug.\\nRemember: In an emergency situation, or if your personal safety is threatened, contact local police or emergency services immediately.\\nHosting can be a great experience, but it may not be right for everyone.

MITRE ATT&CK is actually a knowledge base created for collecting tactics, techniques, and procedures utilized by threat actors during cyber-attacks. Earlier this year a team of cybersecurity professionals from ConnectWise utilized this data to identify the most common techniques utilized to compromise information systems. The top two methods utilized by threat actors in 2021 were Phishing and valid accounts.\\nThe two go hand-in-hand, account information is often acquired during a successful Phishing campaign. Either way, what is clear is that personnel is the first line of defense in protecting company data. Do not allow yourself or a member of your staff to be exploited, inadvertently giving away the keys to the system. Begin by implementing a security awareness training program within your organizations. Review these programs regularly, don’t set it, and forget it. Ensure that they continue to meet the needs of your organization.\\n🤔 Password Protocol\\n“Have you heard that Microsoft recently advised against password changes?”\\nFrequently changing passwords may lead to easily cracked passwords due to making minor modifications to passwords that have been utilized for decades. We are not suggesting to end the practice of regularly changing password. Many organizations are required to implement this practice to meet regulatory and compliance requirements. We are recommending that complex password policies are enforced and MFA (Multifactor Authentication) is implemented as an additional level of protection. If an account has been compromised by a threat actor, MFA may be the last level of defense capable of disrupting the attack.\\nCome One, Come All! 📣\\nPeter will be part of an expert panel discussing all things cybersecurity as a part of MassMEP’s Manufacturing Your Future i4.0 event at Polar Park in Worcester.

       " 'The penalties for underage drinking can be harsh — from losing your driver’s license to being suspended from college. Here’s the bottom line on what happens if you get caught drinking under 21 years old.\\nAs the parent of a teenager, you want them to have a fun and productive high school experience. The teenage years are when kids get their first taste of independence and start testing boundaries as they spend more time away from home with their friends. Today’s teens face many pressures. Academic and athletic pressures typically take center stage. But, in between monitoring your child’s GPA, cheering them on from the sidelines at a game, and helping them shop for prom attire, one of the most vital matters parents need to address on a regular basis is underage drinking.\\nUnderage Drinking by the Numbers\\nAlcohol is never the answer, and it’s often a problem. It may be hard to imagine, but more teenagers are drinking than you may think. At least 7 million kids between ages 12 and 20 drank more than “just a few sips” of alcohol in the past month. To make matters worse, excessive drinking kills an average of close to 4,000 kids under the age of 21 each year, the National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics reported. A survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control revealed that, within the last 30 days, 17% of teens rode with someone who had been drinking alcohol.\\nWhat’s the Bottom Line?\\nAll parents are concerned about the danger of underage drinking. No one wants their child to become a statistic. While it’s essential to lay the ground rules for a no-tolerance policy when it comes to drinking at home, it’s important to learn the consequences if a child does get caught drinking before they turn 21. The penalties can be severe, and having frank discussions with your child about the consequences of underage drinking is a key deterrent for preventing alcohol consumption.\\nThe penalties for underage drinking vary by state. Many teens know the blood alcohol concentration limit for adults is .08%, but limits for kids are much lower. In North Carolina, it is ZERO%! It’s safe to conclude that even a few sips of alcohol can put a teen over the legal limit.\\nThe North Carolina State Highway Patrol states that people under age 21 simply cannot drive with any alcohol or illegally used drugs in their systems — period. Any amount of alcohol will result in an immediate 30-day pretrial revocation. If an underage drinking driver refuses to take such a test, he or she now need only have the smell of alcohol on their breath to be convicted of driving after drinking. Offenders will have their licenses revoked for one year but can get limited driving privileges reinstated by a judge if the driver was at least 18 years old at the time of the offense and did not have a prior conviction.\\nNorth Carolina laws also state that it is unlawful for anyone under the age of 21 to have in their possession, purchase or attempt to purchase, or consume any alcohol products. It is also unlawful for anyone over the age of 21 to give, buy for, or serve those under the age of 21 any alcohol products. If a teen is caught purchasing, using a fraudulent ID, carrying, or consuming alcohol, they will be violating the North Carolina alcohol laws and charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor. Make sure your teen is familiar with the laws. They might be making the right choice not to drink, but if they are hanging out with people who are imbibing, they aren’t in the clear. Constructive possession can be applied if police believe the minor may have an “intent” to drink, such as attending a party where alcohol is served or if they are riding in a car with alcohol.\\nViolation of the laws may include:\\n- Revocation of driver’s license for a minimum of 30 days\\n- Monetary fines\\n- Offense on criminal record\\n- Community service\\nColleges may have their own rules if students are caught partying by campus police. Students may get kicked out of campus housing or even suspended from school. Not surprisingly, college students who drink are more likely to miss class and receive lower grades overall, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association revealed.\\nUnderage Drinking Can Be Costly\\nNot only are the penalties for underage drinking severe, but they can also put a dent in your bank account. Following a DUI, many states require teens to carry pricey, high-risk insurance for a period. In addition to legal fees and court costs, your teen may have to participate in a substance abuse class or attend counseling to get their license back. And these are only the minimum fees. If your teen was in a car crash, the price tag will be significantly higher.\\nSafety Starts at Home\\nMinimum drinking ages, graduated licensing, and zero-tolerance policies are lowering the number of teens who try alcohol. While laws are effective deterrents, the best prevention starts on the home front. Diligent parents can spot the signs of underage drinking and start a conversation about the dangers. Even though it may seem like your teen doesn’t value your opinion, you are still a role model, and they do hear you!\\nStart the Conversation with your child by making sure they understand your family’s consequences for underage drinking. Talk it Out NC recommends establishing a no-tolerance policy for alcohol consumption. Here are some helpful tips to start talking to your child about the danger of underage drinking.\\nKnow the Facts. The penalties for underage drinking are severe. But they aren’t the only reason teens need to avoid alcohol. Learn how alcohol can have a lasting impact on brain development. Teens who drink alcohol are at an increased risk for developing an alcohol use disorder later in life. Underage drinking can also lead to difficulty at school, misuse of other substances, and an increased risk of suicide.\\nDefine the Rules. Once you’ve helped your child understand the dangers of underage drinking, it’s a good idea to outline your family’s rules. Come up with a list of consequences your child may face at home if they decide to drink alcohol. The penalties for getting caught by the police are already stiff and parents should not be afraid to take a firm stance on underage drinking. If you keep alcohol in the house, make sure your teen knows it’s off limits. Consistent enforcement of your house rules is important.\\nEven if your child understands the punishment for drinking, peer pressure and the desire to fit in can be a challenge. Even the most well-behaved kids can find themselves in a situation they regret. Develop a code word your child can text you if they feel unsafe or end up in a tough spot. Agree upon using the aid of a location app for pickup spots. To make the code word effective, your teen should not face negative repercussions if they enlist your help.\\nTake the Pledge. Pledge to be safe around alcohol to help prevent underage drinking. Talk it Out NC offers a pledge both kids and parents can take on their website. As part of the pledge, kids resolve to not drink and drive, decline rides from people who are drinking, agree to text parents if they feel unsafe, and continue talking about underage drinking with their parents. As part of the online pledge, teens also receive periodic texts with tips on how to stay safe. Parents pledge to set healthy examples when it comes to drinking and keep the lines of communication open.\\nStart the Conversation\\nUnderage drinking has lasting repercussions. Take the Pledge with your child when they are young to help keep them safe. Talk it Out NC can provide you with more information on alcohol and has tips on how to Start the Conversation to stop underage drinking.',\n",
       " 'Media Advisory - Property Insurance Advice for Wellington\\nYou can read more about this in NZ Adviser Online\\nFollowing recent uncertainty around property insurance in Wellington, Tall Poppy Real Estate has released the following advice to people buying or selling property in the Wellington Region.\\nDavid Graves, Founder and Director of Tall Poppy, advises people to consider the following if currently buying or selling:\\n- If you are a buyer yet to purchase; start looking at insurance options now and ensure you have an insurance clause in any Sales and Purchase Agreement you sign. Seek legal advice before signing an agreement.\\n- If you are a seller; ensure any agreement you sign is subject to the buyer obtaining appropriate insurance cover. If you’re concerned about the insurance position of your buyer, then double check with your lawyer or salesperson before signing a Sales and Purchase Agreement.\\n- If you are a seller and have accepted an offer, unconditional or otherwise, double check the insurance position with your lawyer or salesperson promptly.\\n- If you are a buyer and have made an offer that’s gone unconditional and you don’t have insurance, consult your lawyer and salesperson as soon as possible.\\nDavid Graves says while the Earthquake Commission (EQC) has a role to play, private insurance is necessary.\\n“EQC’s exposure on buildings is limited to $100,000, so private insurance is required (land exposure is uncapped). If a buyer can’t obtain appropriate insurance cover it’s unlikely they will be able to secure mortgage finance - and a Sales and Purchase Agreement may not be finalised.\\n“Working with an insurance broker can help you navigate the current insurance landscape, and also check in with your bank to see if any options are available. If you’re uncertain about anything to do with insurance, you should contact your lawyer or salesperson to work through any potential issues,” says David Graves.',\n",

       " 'Whether you’ve dealt with the criminal justice system or you simply watch crime-themed television programs, you are probably familiar with a person’s Miranda rights. These rights are a very important part of a criminal suspect’s constitutional rights. A suspect has the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel. If the suspect agrees to talk to police without an attorney present, then the suspect is considered to have “waived” his right to remain silent, as well as his right to counsel (during the questioning).\\nObviously, one of the major keys to any successful criminal defense is keeping out evidence that is harmful to the defense case. One way that can happen is if the defendant made a statement or confession to police after waiving his Miranda rights, but that waiver wasn’t valid. A valid waiver must be “knowing,” “voluntary” and “intelligent.” There are many ways that a defendant’s waiver can be invalidated, including proof that he was confused, was intoxicated, or that he lacked the intellectual capacity to give a valid waiver. What all this establishes is that, even if a defendant confessed to the police, the defendant may still have options and opportunities to obtain an acquittal. That’s why, if you or a loved one are facing charges, don’t give up and don’t go without counsel; retain an experienced Tampa Bay criminal defense attorney to handle the case.\\nAn example of this was on display in a recent case that originated in Polk County. J.W. was, at the time of his arrest, an 18-year-old man with cognitive delays. Two deputies from the Polk County Sheriff’s Office questioned the teen regarding an unsolved sex crime. A sergeant read J.W. his rights and he said he understood. He also signed a waiver form.\\nThe police questioned the teen. He denied committing the crimes, then cried and asked for his “mommy,” then confessed. During a recorded statement, he again denied committing the crimes and then confessed once again. After the confession, several psychologists examined J.W. They determined that he had a third- to fourth-grade reading level, low IQ and was “susceptible to suggestibility.” The charges were later dropped without prejudice and the state re-filed several years later.\\nIn the man’s eventual trial, the court refused to grant the defense request to suppress the confession. The judge rejected the defense’s argument that J.W. did not knowingly and intelligently waive his rights before confessing, and J.W. was ultimately convicted and sentenced to life.\\nA defendant has to understand the Miranda warning for the waiver to be valid\\nThe appeals court later threw out that conviction and sentence. The appeals court’s ruling stated that the defense was correct in arguing that J.W.’s waiver of his rights was not knowing and intelligent. As the court explained in its decision, “intellectual disability alone does not render a confession involuntary.” However, in this case, there were multiple doctors who testified that J.W. did not understand the Miranda warnings read to him and one who stated that the man “probably never has understood Miranda Warnings.” When one doctor asked J.W. what the right to remain silent meant, he responded, “You have to be quiet until the person says to talk.” All the evidence the defense provided was enough to show a waiver that was not sufficiently knowing and voluntary, which meant that the confessions should have been suppressed.\\nThe law presumes everyone to be innocent until proven guilty, and gives everyone certain constitutional rights to ensure that their prosecution is a fair one. One of those rights is the right to counsel. If you or a loved are facing criminal charges or are being questioned in relation to a crime, exercise your rights.

       " 'In our previous article \"Relationship of DNA with carriers of natural information and ancient symbols\" we looked at the ancient symbols of natural information-Lion/Fire and CROWN/WATER-for a more detailed subsequent consideration of what happens to our DNA molecule in the images, symbols, signs on ancient frescoes, paintings, icons, bas-reliefs, etc.\\nImages and their connection\\nOur ancient ancestors thought in images, even in schools, they say, there was a similar subject where they taught reading and thinking in images, but then, of course, it was canceled so that no one would learn it and, accordingly, could not. So, we need to learn anew: look at pictures and think in images based on them. Of the 2 images, the third should turn out to be a mental image in the head. Many saints even hold two fingers for us on icons, paintings, frescoes to tell us the number of images, as on\\nFig.01 Baptism of the Lord or in Fig.02 Icon of the Saints below, with images to think about.\\nI hope that you have already understood that ancient icons, paintings, frescoes depict not people, but images and encrypted symbols that you do not need to look at and describe - in what dress they are or to whom they bow, but with which you need to think and imagine what is depicted in this picture, icon, fresco. And Jesus Christ -everywhere and everywhere - is not a person depicted, but an image of a photon of light in radiation (radiated light around the head), which goes to us in DNA (in the head in Fig.01) by radiation from the Sun / Moon (A ray from the Sun / Moon in Fig.01).\\nAt the bottom of the same icon - Fig.01- 2 fish are depicted - the image of 2 DNA helices in electromagnetic radiation (gray background).\\nIt is necessary to think in 2 images so that what you see on frescoes, icons, paintings are displayed in the 3rd image visually in your thoughts, dreams, and then back to you with information about it and later materialized. 02 on the right shows St. Nicholas the Wonderworker with a \"raspaltsovka\") into two images, and on the left is St. Spyridon of Trimifunt with images of natural information - Fire / Sun / Moon and Water.\\nDifferent people in ancient times depicted the image of DNA in different ways in their works: somewhere with flowers, somewhere with children - the flowers of life (Fig.04)., somewhere with a couple of women, and the Sumerians and our Pushkin depicted DNA in their works as fish and DNA scales (Fig.03)\\nAlso, on some \"coats of arms\" (Fig.07) in ancient books, both flowers and 2 fish are depicted on one \"coat of arms\" at once, because these are all images of the same DNA molecule, which is depicted here in the form of two twisted chains above the \"coat of arms\", and to the right and left of the \"coat of arms\" (Fig.07) shows a figuratively approximate principle of an electrical switching circuit (diagram in Fig.09), according to which DNA works (red-fiery hanging brushes-images).\\nFigure 08 shows the Mother of God with a baby, in whose attire figuratively half in red symbolizes Fire/The sun, and the second half of the garment - blue color-symbolizes Water. The Virgin points to the red robe-Fire/The sun is an image of radiation through which DNA works according to the scheme of an electrical switching circuit, shown on the left in the image of a red-fiery-hanging fringe with tassels on the hat in the same Figure 08.\\nSince DNA is a microcrystalline liquid (Fig.12), i.e., a liquid crystal, it works like computers-on liquid crystals. In electrical networks, both-DNA and computers-work on the principle of parallel and serial connection of elements (from electrical engineering-schemes in Fig.13 and Fig.14-schemes for connecting brushes). In the case of DNA, the elements of the connection are brush images, which are mentally figuratively formed in a person\\'s head and then electrically connected in space.\\nPlace and Method of Immaculate Conception of DNA\\nThe idea of the place and method of formation of our DNA led me to consider the painting \"The Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary\" in Fig. 16 and the painting with the same name in the title of the article with my presentation of images from the painting. In fact, it turns out that the DNA molecule is formed by solar radiation in the glands of the Virgin Mary (about salivary glands from anatomy and Wikipedia).\\nWikipedia: Salivary glands(lat. glandulae salivariae) are glands in the mouth that secrete saliva.\\nThe glands we are talking about, apparently, are salivary, with their saliva secret isolated (from anatomy), since we are talking about DNA. It is possible that we are also talking about the formation of DNA in the pineal gland, in general, in the head, where the sun Ray of radiation from the Sun-God the Father (the elder at the top of the picture) points to the Virgin Mary in Fig.16.\\nIt turns out that the radiation of the Sun carries information for DNA to the glands and then stores it in the DNA in these very glands. This information comes with solar radiation for the existing 3 \"fiery\" DNA elements or for the formation of these 3 \"fiery\" elements in DNA, which I analyzed in the last article on the tablets of Isis (link at the beginning of this article). It seems that these 3 elements - copper, mercury and iron-are either already in our DNA and they are exposed to solar radiation for the purpose of some kind of transformation. Or these elements are initially formed in DNA saliva by solar radiation on a person for the same conception.\\nRays emanating from the Sun are direct solar radiation/radiation; Reflected water radiation/radiation is radiation that is reflected by water or the earth\\'s surface from the Moon.\\nScattered solar radiation is formed when the light flux from the Sun is scattered.\\nThe same thing with \"water\" elements from the same place (from the same article): lead, tin, silver are either already in our DNA and they are exposed to water \"radiation\" for the purpose of some kind of transformation. Or these elements are formed in DNA saliva by means of water \"radiation\" on a person for the same conception.\\nThe fact that radiation has a negative effect on our DNA is told to us everywhere, but about the fact that there is also a positive effect of various radiations on DNA - it is silent. (Of course, radiation is different from radiation, but it is known that everything is poison and everything is medicine, only the dose matters.\\nFigure 16 shows the immaculate conception by the radiation of DNA saliva (Symbol-flowers:2 flowers above the columns) of a person with images and symbols, which occurs with the help of the image of God the Father - a gray-haired elder above the columns, which is the actual Sun. And also, the conception depicted occurs with the help of the image of the Holy Spirit - an Angel (in the picture in a pink dress and with wings), which is actually a photon of light from solar radiation in the image with a halo of light - an aura. From the actual Sun, a light ray is shown - a dove - an image of the solar radiation of light quanta that goes to the Virgin Mary and which carries information to her for DNA saliva (from anatomy), then stores it in DNA saliva. At the same time, DNA-saliva is already immaculately conceived with information in its glands, and subsequently, apparently, the stored DNA-saliva information is already used from there, if necessary, it seems that already at the real birth of a person.\\nIt turns out that only part of the DNA genes we get from our parents and another part of the DNA we get in the information from nature (most likely the one that \"scientists\" call us \"garbage\").\\np.s. everything that is considered in the article is the thoughts and fabrications of the author of the Owl and may not coincide with the thoughts of readers and owners of the site.',\n",

       " 'You know what really pisses me off as of late? Bands that are overly built up in the press and fall flat when you see them live, that’s what! You go to a show on the advice of others, trusting that what you are about to hear and see will fulfill the expectations you have set for the experience you are about to have. I mean is it me or are there an insane amount of bands that just can’t put on a good show anymore?! Well just recently, I came face to face with a group that surprised the hell out me.\\nRED SUN RISING is not “really” new to the game we call rock. They originated a whisker over a decade ago, but they didn’t fully jump into the active rock world until after they signed to Razor & Tie Records back in 2014. Now, I can honestly say this band doesn’t come across as inexperienced by any means. If you were not familiar with their upbringing, you would assume that they were 30 years in. I know that you might scoff at that considering there are so many bands in the same segment as Red Sun Rising. So much so that you could get confused on who you were actually listening to. If you were to look out across a current chart listing, the names would all bleed together, like a Sharpie on a sheet of paper. This band stands out in my mind because there seems to be something different about them. Is it an artistic sensibility that drives them? Yes, they can get in your face lyrically, so don’t think they are all peace love and happiness; regardless what their logo’d merch might suggest. Their art drives an internal aggression it seems, and a dark one at that.\\nThat spins us fast forward to their recent full-length release ‘Thread’. This record is an example of a band hitting their stride artistically, plain and simple. There seems to be a real effort to step away from the obvious vanilla taste of the others in their genre. The track “Deathwish” puts a real hard foot forward to that mantra. This song approaches topical with a darkness that pulls at you throughout.\\nTheir other standout “Fascination” pulls slow tonal and melancholy cues from The Cranberries’ “Zombie” but hot-rodded up with a bit of a stringed bite. Is the homage blatant? I don’t think so. I find it honest coming from a band that might be coming to terms with who they really are. We are all made up of many parts; some make a bigger impact than others do. If you look back over the band’s previous hits off ‘Polyester Zeal’, they always seemed to be exploring who they are and what they are comprised of.\\nRED SUN RISING is currently out on their own headlining tour in support of ‘Thread’, and I think it is the best thing that they could have done for the band’s progression. While they were out on tour opening up for POP EVIL back a few years, they couldn’t spread their intellectual wings enough. After seeing them perform in Dallas, this band needs to be let loose to meander as needed. To clarify a bit, this band doesn’t work well playing second or third fiddle. That isn’t because they are too pompous to follow, but rather they are really best with no ceiling to hold them down!\\nIf you get the chance to go and see this band, do not second-guess your opportunity. Just as they have seemingly come to terms with themselves, you need to follow where the art takes you.',\n",
       " \"A risk with many food safety audits is that they contain so much detail only the food safety specialists in an organisation take any notice of the reports. The usual way to counter this 'audit fatigue' is to produce management summaries of the audits to show the main findings and trends. These summary reports can help to drive improvements, especially when linked to performance management systems, but a valuable addition can be to involve senior managers in the audit process.\\nBusy managers are not going to do the full 'walls-floors-ceilings' routine, but if the aim is only to provide a personal snap-shot of the standards in a unit, then we can use a few 'key indicators' to highlight the way food safety is being managed in a unit. The benefit of this approach is to engage the operational hierarchy by encouraging them to apply their management skills to food safety.\\nThis is similar to the way experienced leaders manage financial performance in their operations. When regional managers are visiting a unit they will ask the site manager about certain key indicators of performance, such as like-for-like sales, staff turnover and waste - then they'll use their experience to coach the manager in areas needing improvement.\\nThe idea of the One Minute Audit is is to apply this technique to food safety. If we could develop an efficient way for senior management to spot the key 'food safety management' issues in a unit, then they could coach to the site manager in ways to improve performance. The success of this management intervention can then be measured using the formal audit reports, in the same way the company P&L measures the financial success of business.\\nAll experienced auditors will have develop ways of assessing standards using some key indicators of performance, and in practice the balance of the audit is just to gather supporting evidence. The secret of the One Minute Audit is to distil these key indicators into a simple checklist, then train managers in basic audit skills plus give them the knowledge to coach their teams. Common indicators will include specific pieces of equipment that often get overlooked if managers fail to implement effective cleaning schedules - the head of the post mix drinks dispenser, the interior of the ice maker, the blade of the table mounted can-open.\\nThen there's the indicators of how the site manager maintains hygienic practices - do the training records cover the current staff team, are the temperature records 'real', did the manager wash his/her hands on entering the food preparation room.\\nIf we equip senior managers with the capability to assess standards and drive improvements, we can move the accountability for food safety management from the technical specialist into the hands of the line management.\",\n",
       " 'This is a global emergency. Most of us are worried about this situation, but the coronavirus is part of our worries. Some of us live in a country where the government has enforced strict laws and rules erging you to stay home. For example, here in the UK, we went into a lockdown for at least 3 weeks on the evening of the 23rd of March with the aim to slow down the spread of the virus. Learn more here. That was after the softer rules were not being fully obeyed.\\nAs soon as the lockdown procedure has agreed by your government, many of us are asking the following questions... How are we going to isolate ourselves? How will I continue my daily activities requiring me to leave my home? How will I continue working for my business or what about my job? Today we are going to answer some of the most burning questions circulating in our minds.\\nNote: Please keep in mind that parts of the answers are based on our personal opinions. Of course, we will list the sources of where we got the rest of the information.\\nWhere to find COVID-19 statistics in my area?\\nCoronavirus has been involved drastically and now there are many statistic-based websites where you can get the latest coronavirus data. One of them which we particularly liked is ncovtrack.com. ncovtrack.com displays detailed statistic data down to every county from multiple countries including the US, UK, Germany and more as well as historical data, dashboards and maps.\\nShould I be worried?\\nWell, it highly depends. If you have travelled, have been in a big social and tight event with lots of people (such as concert or wedding) or felt unwell or sick such as fever, high temperature, continuous cough or had diarrhea during the last 2 weeks, then I would strongly advise you to stay at home and not go out at all for at least 14 days. Some Health organizations prefer to say 7 days but to absolutely minimize the chances of getting infected, 14 days is the key number. Getting food during this period should only be done by delivery.\\nHowever, if the above don\\'t apply to you, then you should worry that much. If you follow the rules given to you by your Health service in your country (NHS for the UK) then you should be mostly fine.\\nWhat are your best tips to prevent getting infected?\\nOur very best tips are listed below:\\n- Don\\'t go out unless:\\n- Going for Shopping. Try going to minimarkets instead and the closest to your home as possible. That way you will get in contact with as few people as possible. Even that should be done as infrequently as you can. If you are very worried and there are lots of cases in your city, order food by using delivery services.\\n- Absolute essential work. This is work where cannot be done from home. Even that, should be done by at most 2-people meeting. Again, if there are lots of infections in your area, city or county, try and see if you can postpone the meeting. Say NO to your friends when they ask you to go out.\\n- Medical needs. In most of the countries, if not all countries, the covernment ordered pharmacies and grocery shops to stay open. If you need and medical supplies, go to your local pharmacy ASAP.\\n- Exercise. This is only for going out for a run by yourself. Try to keep the running distances as short as possible and close to your house. This is only if you don\\'t have any exercising or gym facilities in your house. In my case it take it to the even more extreme level. To keep myself healthy, I jog up and down then I do the basic exercises such as push, ups and abs. I even filled my bag with books to do bicep curls. Be creative!\\n- Follow basic health safety measurements such as:\\n- Wash your hands as frequently as possible. Try to wash your hands for 20 seconds or sing happy birthday while washing them. There is no excuse not for not washing your hands as soon as you return from your grocerings or pharmacy. If you stay with other people in your house, erge them to wash their hands too.\\n- Have a sanitiser with you at all times, even when you go out and use it frequently.\\n- Don\\'t touch your face after touching a foreign object. Use your sanitiser first.\\n- If possible, purchase a mask and wear it while you are out for shopping, pharmacy or absolute essential work.\\n- If you are going out for essential work and there is no other way around it, make sure there is a distance between you and the other person of at least 2 meters (6 feet).\\n- Keep yourself and your house clean. Have a shower at least once a day. Make sure to wash your clothes as frequently as possible. Chances are your clothes will be in contact with a foreign object containing the virus. Changing your clothes as soon as you go home and immediately having a shower is a must.\\nHow to \"survive\" a lockdown?\\nBeing in a lockdown is definitely not very fun. Those who are depending on activities occurring away from home will be sadly affected the most. This includes students, business owners, employees etc. Here we came up with as many tips to survive a lockdown as possible:\\n- Convert activities you would normally do out of your house into virtual. For instance, use a video chat software (Skype, FaceTime) whenever possible to chat with your teammates or your close ones. We are social species and we occasionally have the need to interact with others.\\n- Get a computer! Despite now most of the jobs have been converted or being done electronically, there is still a small number of people who don\\'t have access to a computer. Make sure to get one as soon as you can. If you have a smartphone, that tip would be less of a worry.\\n- Study remotely. If your school offers remove study, make most out of it. If you are a college student and your library is still open, see if you can borrow some books from there. Staff will also be aware of how disruptive this situation can be, so they will be willing to help you when you need it.\\n- As a student, see if you can get/borrow further equipment from your school or university if it\\'s still open and contact your professors if you cannot have access to them and possible alternative options.\\n- Ask if you need help.

The history of the Internet is no different.\\nLong before blogs and social media made it trivially easy to shout from the rooftops, having an opinion online meant creating your own website. Most of the web hosting services that helped give early Internet users a voice have disappeared and next year, we\\'ll be adding another to the list.\\nYahoo Japan recently announced plans to close GeoCities in March 2019. The web hosting service has essentially been on life support since 2009 when Yahoo pulled the plug in other parts of the world.

However, if you want to disappear, you can choose to permanently delete your profile as well as all information, saved articles, photos, orders, and messages.\\nDelete Your Information Directly From Websites\\nDeleting an account is relatively easy, but there is more to it.

The rise of biometric data-scraping ( some companies build their facial recognition databases from images retrieved from Facebook and Instagram ) shows that social networks pose a considerable threat to privacy.\\nUse a VPN. A VPN encrypts your browsing data and conceals your IP address, so your data remains invisible and cannot be exploited by marketing companies. While bad internet habits can be potentially problematic, a VPN can help keep your activities private and secure.\\nAlso Read: Internet Search Engines',\n",
       " 'We share with blog readers the results of a study conducted on the B2B market.\\nThe task is to understand the motives for choosing contractors and the principal value of cooperation. On this occasion, we had our hypotheses.\\nSome companies have been developing digital marketing and sales strategies for ten years. Previously, digital had little penetration into the B2B sphere. Personal selling remained the primary sales tool, and the central problem was the need for more sales growth and the loss of customers.\\nThe approach of most market participants has stayed the same, but the transition to digital tools has begun. Many now consider working with an online audience as a solution to the problem of low sales. They start social networks based on “being on the wave”.\\nIn pursuit of leads and trends, attention is paid to communication with the client and, most importantly, his deep tasks. We call for a return to understanding the goals and objectives of the client. The job that the client is hiring you for. This is not only the development of an advertising campaign, software installation, customs clearance or the supply of components. Your competitors can do all this. Sometimes even cheaper or faster.\\nAn in-depth interview helped us to look into the client’s values.\\nAn in-depth interview is an opportunity to express yourself in an accessible form. We seek to know the interviewee’s emotions and point of view on the issue on which attention is focused.\\nQuestions are not as rigidly defined as in a survey. The general scheme of the interview is planned, and during the conversation, the interviewer independently determines which question to go to or asks additional clarifying questions. Depending on the situation, the interview can take 30 minutes to several hours. The main focus is confidential communication. We need an honest assessment of the issue of interest. The specialist must be able to overcome the isolation and tension of the respondent.\\nTo get detailed answers and understand the logic of decision-making, following the person’s thoughts and engaging in dialogue is essential. Therefore, no other method of questioning is suitable.\\nThe Main Motive For Choosing A Supplier In B2B\\nThe results did not surprise us. Hypotheses were in the air, and 80% of the market refused to notice them. Therefore, the marketing of most companies in the B2B sector is still at the level of 2022.\\nSo, 100% of the surveyed owners and top managers named personal sympathy as the primary motive for choosing a supplier. The right words and arguments, the manifestation of expertise. It looks objective, but it is essential to understand that it will be something different for everyone.\\nAt the same time, the owner-owner option was considered the most successful communication format. Great, but where do those “right people” come from? Most commercial offers go to waste, and the most popular response to a cold call is, “We don’t need it.”\\nB2B market participants confidently called a recommendation the best reason to contact a particular company. This fact raises the institution of reputation in B2B to a new level. Think about how long ago the approach to solving complex customer problems and handling complaints was revised.\\nAre you ready to quickly and effectively fix the mistake? Who in the company is engaged in primary communication with customers? What is the feedback there?\\nWhat Sales In B2B Do Not Work?\\nWhat about cold calls? What KP to prepare to get a contract?\\nEverything is evident here. The course has long been taken on an individual approach and expertise. Most B2B services and products are complex and require knowledge of the customer’s product and business.\\nThe situation when a company tries to warm up the market with the help of cold calls is a thing of the past. Respondents unanimously stated that calls made by inexperienced employees are only annoying. When the conversation goes beyond the sales script, such managers often need help to keep the conversation on the same level as the decision-maker.\\nDuring the study, it became clear that the trend towards an individual approach only affected some. Only a few companies demonstrate a deep understanding of customer needs. Sending a general commercial proposal without considering the client’s objectives is still the norm.\\nWhat Is The Corporate Client Waiting For?\\nWhat worries me? What are the challenges facing owners?\\nEach market is different, and so are contractors’ tasks. However, three commonalities are visible when deciding whether to hire or change a supplier.\\n- The first is the level of communication. A corporate client needs to keep everything under control. What can go wrong? The contractor needs to get in touch, provide a regular report, or take a long time to implement the requested work adjustments. In such a situation, the client spends energy worrying and trying to contact and could – on developing his business.\\nAs a contractor, the frequency of communication may be sufficient. Accept that this is your vision of the situation and agree with the client on acceptable terms of interaction before the entire market learns from a dissatisfied client that you cannot be trusted.\\n- The second is saving the client’s time. Everything is necessary here. How quickly you will deal with the difficulties, whether you will involve the client in this and in what form you will begin to discuss the project. The main job for which the client hires a contractor is to stop wasting time on decision-making and control. The task should cease to exist, and the result of the work should remain clear.\\nWe like the saying, “The client doesn’t want to see you push; he wants to see the baby”. So don’t invite the client to birth with you.\\nIf you understand that the perception of each party’s contribution has changed over time, discuss the new arrangements with the client.\\n- The third is confidence and security. What do we fear most in business? Lose money and time. Which of these is more important? There is only one task – to show the client your expertise and give guarantees. It’s often better to immediately stop doing tasks you can’t handle. Refrain from trusting communication with clients to employees who cannot communicate with the client professionally and on an equal footing.',\n",

All the way back in 2000, David Sedaris wrote about the speech impediment classes he took in elementary school to rid him of his lisp. Waggishly, he quipped that the class was actually attended by Future Gay Boys of America.\\nSedaris was filling in an anecdote with truthy observations, and not by any means making a documentary. By creating a personal account of his experience with the gay voice, he’s permitted to put himself in the story. Unfortunately, David Thorpe was unable to remove himself in the documentary Do I Sound Gay? in which he struggles with his status as a single gay man in his 40s, and uses that to explore his gay voice, the phenomenon of the gay voice, and why the gay voice matters. He bounces around from topic to topic, never dwelling long enough on anything to let that point make a definitive statement. Is it about misogyny? Is it because the gay voice has a feminine structure? Is it condemned because gay men became gay because we like masculine identifiers? Is it picked up as a social habit; a gay code of sorts?\\nWe never get answers to these because Thorpe interjects himself all over the map. At several points throughout the movie, Thorpe edits in classic films that are supposed to have gay-coded characters. He lets the characters talk for a line or two, then proceeds to finish their lines in a voiceover. This style is representative of the movie, where he gets experts in gay culture to speak their opinions, then proceeds to whine right over it and interject his own voice lessons in how to speak more hetero. There are gold bricks of good information, but they’ve been paved over by Thorpe’s insecurities, and that’s a shame.\\nOne of the prominent festival rules is “Sometimes the movie you see is the movie you can make it to.” That is, sometimes you have no idea what you’re watching, but you’ll watch it anyways because it is near the last movie, and starts at a time that doesn’t impede anything else. Sometimes you’ll end up with genius. Other times, you’ll end up with crap. My decision to watch Pioneer Heroes ended with the latter, but I’m not even entirely sure about that.\\nNatalya Kudryashova’s first feature film is nothing but ambitious. It’s a non-linear film with a broken timeline, flipping between present day (2015) and 1987. It also follows three different characters along both timelines. Yes, there are six different stories happening at once. The 1987 timeline follows three children under the Soviet Union striving to be Pioneer Heroes, a group of scouts who are actually experiments in ultra-patriotic Lenin-worshipping brainwashing. One boy refuses to be a lead singer in a choir, desiring to clack his tongue like everybody else. One girl stresses because her grandfather is brewing alcohol, and it is forbidden. Another girl…blech.\\nWhatever Kudryashova is trying to say is lost in translation. I couldn’t tell if she was criticizing the naivete of the children and the program, or if she was praising its patriotism. I couldn’t tell if she was saying that the brainwashing messed up their adult lives, of if their adult lives were messed up because they strayed away from the teachings of Lenin. Is it better to be conservative and listen to the leaders? That’s what I got from the movie, but others didn’t react the same way, though they were similarly confused. Though, maybe the confusion in ultra-liberal Seattle was because we were rejecting the ultra-conservative pro-Soviet Union message in the film.\\nThursday’s world premiere of Aaron Hann and Mario Miscione’s Circle was a phenomenal hit that retained its audience through a significant technical glitch. The glitch, which happened about an hour through the movie, saw the various audio tracks go off sync, and suddenly we were hearing dialogue in three separate times in three separate locations creating a weird psychotic break for about 3-5 minutes, after which they stopped the movie, had to fix the problem, and restarted it. Only 2 people walked out. That’s a real film at work.\\nCircle plays with tropes familiar to anybody who has been watching indie science fiction for the past two decades. 50 people wake up in a room standing on individual red circles laid out in a patterned ring surrounding a black dome. If they step out of their circles, they’re killed and dragged off the board. Every two minutes, the black dome zaps a person and they are dragged out of the room. Eventually, the people figure out that they can vote on the next to die via a pattern in the floor, but each person can only see the vote that they themselves are casting. Soon enough, it’s trying to figure out who everybody is, and who deserves to live and die.\\nThe question isn’t “does a life matter?” but “how do you value a life?” Hann and Miscione fill the circle with 50 identifiably American characters arguing over identifiably American values. The gimmick of a death every 2 minutes keeps Circle moving at a rapid, almost breathless, pace. Just as you’re getting comfortable in a conversation, suddenly somebody dies. The screenplay is clever and knowing, even if it feels a bit rushed and cliched at times. Hann and Miscione aren’t here to make judgments on their characters, but have filled them with the observations they’ve seen in their experiences. But, more than the politics, Circle is just a hell of a lot of fun.\\nThe Seattle International Film Festival is known for its mix of under the radar films and high profile indies. On the third Friday of the festival, they showed the high profile Mister Holmes, the new pairing of director Bill Condon and Ian McKellan. They last worked together on Gods and Monsters, the indie darling about the end of James Whale’s life. This time around, they’re focusing on the end of Sherlock Holmes’ life, and casting his last case in a different light.\\nBased on Mitch Cullin’s A Slight Trick of the Mind, Mister Holmes finds Holmes returning home from a trip to Japan where he was trying to buy an oil to help him with his loss of memory (read: Alzheimer’s Disease). In his country mansion, he’s at odds with his housemaid while befriending her son. Holmes spends his time rewriting his final story, a chintzy remake of Vertigo and getting the son to be his editor. And, he also retells his travels to Japan.\\nIf there’s something deep, I’m not sure what it is. Mister Holmes has three different timelines in just 105 minutes, not having enough time to properly dive into any of them. Perhaps the greatest mystery of all is that there is no mystery. There is, instead, a dedication to humanity and love in the golden years of fading memory and abilities. But, even that is poorly done and not well constructed. One must resort to the simple pleasures of Ian McKellan starring as Sherlock Holmes (and possibly Laura Linney as his housemaid).\\nWith a much lower profile is the PBS-produced documentary The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution, about the rise and fall of the Black Panthers. For those that don’t know, the Black Panthers were a national group of black people who wanted to better their own community through beneficial programs and displays of power. The iconic image of the Black Panther is the black man in a leather jacket and hat armed with large guns defending their right to bear arms. But, they also were developing programs to rid themselves of the class structure that disempowered the black community through poverty and lack of education. One such program was free breakfasts for school children in poverty-stricken neighborhoods.\\nVanguard is an average doc about an important subject. Stanley Nelson can’t wrangle the subject into a form that expands beyond the PBS origins, and, subsequently, it lacks the passion that would be fitting of the Black Panthers. One doesn’t make a 10-point program without being passionate and angry about the situation surrounding you. Instead of editing with passion, Nelson has talking heads saying that the anger was in the streets. Nelson’s generic tone doesn’t match the radical subject matter; but is that to make it more palatable to the PBS audience? Whatever it is, it suffers.\\nStill, the SIFF presentation of Vanguard on Friday night was one to remember. To have a follow-up discussion of subject matter in the film, SIFF conducted a Q&A with Ericka Huggins, a leader in the Black Panthers, and subsequent activist. Huggins is, perhaps, one of the wisest people that I have ever had the fortune to listen to. Her Q&A was everything I have ever wanted to hear in a leader without having ever heard it before.\\nThe audience was filled with a variety of walks of life. In one corner there was a group of youthful black activists who were fighting against the building of a new juvenile detention center in the middle of a black-prominent neighborhood. They also taught an extra school that focused on black and activist history. Standing on the stairs during the Q&A was a white police officer. Sons of black panthers were behind me. Well-meaning liberal white people were around my seat.\\nMs. Huggins answered a few questions, but with these wise poetic answers that would drift from topic to topic, but always coming back to the core of the question. When asked about the industrial prison complex, she first started talking about the various socioeconomic factors that lead people to commit acts that would guide them to the path of prison. Even as she condemned prison, she was pointing out the problems that increased the populations of prison. She commented on how the current class system is structured off the plantation, where the moneyed interests used the police as ranch hands to control the uprisings of the slaves/peasants/working class. She commented on the educations system and its funding, and the limitations that come with high cost higher education. Through it all, Ms. Huggins spoke in a cool, calm, and collected manner that spoke to her decades of wisdom without coming from a place of elite authority. This will remain a cherished moment where the Q&A was so full of wisdom and love.\\nNext Entry: Stories, investigations, and the only film (so far) that I cannot figure out how to rate.',\n",
       " 'The Marvel Cinematic Universe has (in)famously had a hard time establishing romantic relationships between its characters: even the few love stories that have helped to define the overarching story have sometimes gone through ups and downs, or simply collided headfirst with a brick wall and died (looking at you, Thor & Jane). And yet they keep trying to master the same old boy-meets-girl (or Norse-god-meets-girl, or boy-meets-alien, or computer-program-meets-girl) formula. That’s why, in celebration of Valentine’s Day, I’ve set myself a challenge: trying to find the ten most romantic, endearing, adorable couples in the MCU and ranking them.\\nDisclaimer: “ships” or non-canon pairings aren’t being considered on this list because that would be cheating – most MCU “ships” are at least ten times better than the majority of actual onscreen pairings. It’s simply not fair to compare.\\n10: Thor & Jane Foster.\\nThese two had something that looked like potential – I mean, if you squinted really hard. From the moment that Thor, the Norse God of Thunder and rightful heir to the throne of Asgard, crash-landed in the American Southwest, upsetting one of Jane Foster’s pseudo-scientific experiments, Marvel tried to convince audiences that a grand and glorious epic love-story for the ages was brewing – but all the magic (or “what your ancestors call magic”) words in the Marvel mythos couldn’t force Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman to look more than remotely disinterested in each other. And after Thor: The Dark World failed to turn up the heat, or really do anything at all, Portman had finally had enough: she quit the MCU, and Jane Foster was subsequently written out of the story. In Thor: Ragnarok, it was briefly mentioned that she broke up with the Thunder God offscreen – an uncomfortably awkward conclusion to what was supposed to be a cornerstone of Thor’s entire arc.\\n9: Stephen Strange & Christine Palmer.\\nI’m actually tempted to move this couple ever so slightly further up the list, because while they’re not exactly memorable, they’re also probably not as bad and/or boring as you remembered. Dr. Stephen Strange, a snobbish, arrogant surgeon, wasn’t just the on-and-off boyfriend of Dr. Christine Palmer – he was also her work-partner, and it was mentioned (though never really elaborated on) that the two had even pioneered an important new surgical technique, making the couple basically equal. And after Strange’s run-in with karma, it was Palmer who tried to help him recover his strength and rebuild his life: their heated argument about Strange’s future is the most powerful scene in the Doctor Strange movie, and carries a lot of emotional weight. Unfortunately, Rachel McAdams’ character basically fades into the background after that, and apart from being privy to a battle on the astral plane and trying (unsuccessfully) to save the Ancient One’s life, she really has nothing more to do in the story. And she’s not returning for the sequel, so I guess that’s the end of that.\\n8: Peter Quill & Gamora.\\nI don’t really like either Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star-Lord, an interstellar pirate armed with braggadocio, semi-Celestial powers that have proved to be entirely inconsequential outside of his own movies, and an impressive playlist of golden oldies), or Gamora (a.k.a. The Most Dangerous Woman In The Galaxy, who never actually lived up to that title before her untimely death at the hands of\\nmale screenwriters who didn’t know what else to do with her her own father, Thanos): nonetheless, I have to admit they had a spark of chemistry in both Guardians Of The Galaxy movies – and their interactions in Avengers: Infinity War, during which Gamora nearly convinced Quill to kill her (long story), are pretty emotional. There was something there! It wasn’t much, maybe, but it also wasn’t not there – much to the dismay of Thor & Peter Quill shippers everywhere. But in the end, Quill failed (because doesn’t he always?), Gamora got tossed off a cliff, and here we are with nothing left of their relationship but a sad trail of bubbles.\\n7: Natasha Romanoff & Bruce Banner.\\nI like Avengers: Age Of Ultron. I know it’s unpopular to say this, but it’s honestly the best Avengers movie – not only because it references the events of Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D., but also because it successfully balances almost all of the main characters while still being able to add a couple new ones to the mix. There’s a cohesive plot, the stakes are raised, and the Avengers get to interact with each other on a more personal, intimate level than ever before. And then there’s Natasha Romanoff’s random relationship with Bruce Banner – while it’s not a bad idea, and they make a cute couple, the basis for their coupling up is based on the problematic idea that they’re both “monsters”: Bruce, because he transforms into a giant green killing machine; Natasha, because she’s…infertile? The messaging is weird and kind of sexist, especially since it would have been way easier to make Natasha’s murderous past with the KGB the reason for her guilt and self-loathing. It’s a shame, because Natasha actually did have better interactions with Bruce than she ever had with her former love interest, Clint Barton, but for better or worse their story arc was completely abandoned in Avengers: Infinity War.\\n6: T’Challa & Nakia.\\nWhile there’s certainly an argument to be made that T’Challa, the catsuit-wearing guardian of the African nation of Wakanda, is slightly more low-key and subdued than many of his co-stars in Black Panther (let’s face it, he doesn’t have Okoye’s fiery energy, Killmonger’s smoldering charisma, or M’Baku’s macabre humor), there can be no denying that his relationship with Wakandan secret agent/humanitarian Nakia is super cute. The two are a power couple, with both characters having genuine hero moments – Nakia even briefly diverts the main focus of the film away from T’Challa, and considers becoming the Black Panther herself. By the end of the film, she’s also working around the world to help extend Wakandan aid to those in need. And when they’re onscreen together, they’re presented as a healthy, sturdy relationship that doesn’t have to rely on drama, troubling gender dynamics, or sarcastic banter to be interesting. They’re basically #CoupleGoals, and I love them.\\n5: Wanda Maximoff & The Vision.\\nAh, the tragic story of the computer program who became a man…once, for no apparent reason, and never did so again. The Vision, a sentient computer program outfitted with a cool new body (that, unfortunately for him, came along with the Mind Stone, one of the most coveted objects in the galaxy), didn’t really show any signs of attraction to the troubled witch, Wanda Maximoff, until Captain America: Civil War, but when their romance finally kicked into gear, and the two began to bond over spicy food, things got good – and then immediately got weird again, when Wanda blasted Vision through a floor, before suddenly…ending up on the run with him in Scotland? Where Vision was suddenly able to turn into a human man, but only did so once, for reasons that were never explained? Yeah, so there’s some serious gaps in what we actually know about their relationship, but at least it ended on a strong note, with Wanda having to brutally murder her lover in an attempt to destroy the Mind Stone before Thanos could get to it, only to watch Thanos use the Time Stone to reverse all her hard work, murder Vision again, and use the Stones to wipe out half the galaxy, including Wanda herself. If it’s any consolation, the upcoming WandaVision series on Disney+ will feature Wanda resurrecting her dead partner, only to have him presumably die once again when her entire reality inevitably comes crashing down around her. Cheerful, am I right?\\n4: Scott Lang & Hope Van Dyne.\\nTechnically, there have been two canon MCU power couples that call themselves Ant-Man and The Wasp: Hope Van Dyne’s parents, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne, and then Hope herself and her partner, reformed burglar/single father/world’s best grandma, Scott Lang. But the latter couple has the edge on its predecessor, mostly because Janet doesn’t actually show up until the end of the second Ant-Man film, and most of her flashbacks with Hank were cut out of the movie anyway. Scott and Hope share the spotlight (and the title-card) in Ant-Man And The Wasp, which focuses almost entirely on their relationship – and their exchanges of playful, witty banter, coupled with their fidelity and focus on family, make them one of the most endearing couples in the MCU.\\n3: Steve Rogers & Peggy Carter.\\nSpecifically, their relationship in the first three Captain America films, before Avengers: Endgame happened. In the beginning, scrawny new recruit Steve Rogers and fast-talking, no-nonsense commanding officer Peggy Carter were actually quite a sweet pairing: they both had character arcs, and agency in their own stories. There was a quaint little 1940’s love story between them, but Peggy, by virtue of being in the military, wasn’t forced to play the damsel-in-distress or grieving-girlfriend-on-the-home-front roles: and in the post-war era, after Steve went down in the frigid Antarctic Ocean and was lost, she picked up her life and moved on, founding S.H.I.E.L.D. and starting a family. Her relationship with Steve after his resurrection from the ice was deeply emotional and interesting, and it was tragic when she passed away. But then to essentially reverse all the complexities of their post-The First Avenger relationship by having Steve go back in time and start all over with her, making her essentially a consolation prize for Steve after he failed to move on with his life, thus preventing her from moving on with hers? No, just no.\\n2: Tony Stark & Virginia “Pepper” Potts.\\nThey’re the MCU’s original duo: how could they not come in near the top of the list? Tony was a sarcastic, cynical mess of a human being; a war-profiteer who didn’t care one iota about the countless people killed daily by his weapons of mass destruction; Pepper was the very opposite, a cool, collected woman with savvy business skills and a friendly disposition. It’s a trope, and a tired one at that. But their relationship evolved into so much more than that – Tony became Iron Man, and Pepper took over as CEO of Stark Industries. They constructed the Avengers Tower in New York City. In the five years after Avengers: Infinity War, they got married and had a daughter. In Avengers: Endgame, where they even got to fight in battle alongside each other, their decade-long relationship came to an end with Tony Stark’s tragic death. In that final moment, as the former “Merchant of Death” gave up his life to save the world, Pepper stayed beside him and her face was the last thing he ever saw. I’m not crying: you’re crying.\\n1: Leopold Fitz & Jemma Simmons.\\nYes, I cheated! Fitz and Simmons, or “Fitzsimmons” as they’re more commonly known among the fandom, are not technically members of the MCU: they come from the Marvel TV division, where they made their debut on Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. and have endured through six grueling, torturous seasons of hardship, personal loss, tragedy and pure, wholesome romance. While they started out as the team’s two bumbling, socially-awkward scientists, it didn’t take long before the universe’s vendetta against them resulted in them standing up for S.H.I.E.L.D., and for each other, in incredible ways. Their tense, frantic struggle to figure their way out of an airtight box at the bottom of the ocean (long story) was one of the highlights of Season 1, as it showed just how powerful the two are as a team – so of course they were then split up. Jemma became an undercover spy, got eaten by a space monolith, was transported to another planet and had to survive on her own, fell in love with an astronaut who turned into an evil alien god, was possessed by the Kree, was possibly hinted to be bisexual (come on, we all know she had a thing for Daisy), and even met and defeated the demonic personification of her self-doubt: Leo lost his ability to communicate for a long period of time and became delusional, was possibly hinted to be bisexual (come on, we all know he had a thing for Mac), became a dashing secret agent, met his evil HYDRA doppelganger, fell in love with HYDRA’s cyborg overlord, and then got stuck in two different time-periods at once, which resulted in him dying but still being alive and yet somehow a space pirate in both timelines…it’s a wacky and confusing series, but their love for each other, which persists even against all odds, has always been at the heart of the story, and I would be lying if I didn’t say they’re the most romantic couple in what used to technically be part of (or at least adjacent to) the MCU.\\nSo what do you think of my top ten, and would you have chosen differently?

       " 'Our take on Chi’s very fast-styling iron with its unique plates infused with volcanic lava\\nAvailable sizes: 1”,1.5”\\nFor which hair type: thick hai̇r, medium to long hair\\nWhat we like: durable, fast results\\nWhat we don’t like: too hot for fine hair, no temperature control\\nChi’s original lava ceramic Flat Iron brings a simple yet very effective styling experience. If you’re on a hunt for a very fast flat iron that brings bone-straight results, that has highly durable material, Chi may be the right choice for you. Its most unique quality that stands out is its volcanic lava-infused plates that makes this tool very long-lasting as well as bringing frizz-free results. Don’t get us wrong; this tool is far from being perfect. It doesn’t have temperature control and it reaches to temperatures up to 395F. This means there’s no gentle option for fine hair and this tool certainly is not suitable for fragile strands. It also doesn’t have auto shot off which is a very handy feature that makes flat irons safe against fire. But it still is a luxury tool with best quality material, and with $100, we think it’s worth the price. Below we share our experiences with “Chi Original Lava Ceramic Hair Styling Iron”. If you’re curious about the competition, check out the article about best flat irons for black hair.\\nTable Of Contents\\n- Shape And Size\\n- Heat And Variable Settings\\n- Material And Performance\\n- Price And Guarantee\\nSize of a flat iron is one of the most important aspects to consider before making a healthy decision. Chi Lava Ceramic Flat iron gives you two options to choose from. The smaller 1” one is considered the medium sized and it fits almost all hair types. It’s slim enough to come closer to the roots for shorter hair types and large enough to cover enough area at one pass for longer types. But if your hair is very short, it’s wise to consider an even slimmer option such as FHI Platform Signature Pro Styler with a plates size of 0.5”, half of Chi’s plates. The 1.5” option is for the longer and thicker hair types and for the ones that want an even faster styling experience.\\nIt has an 3.55” plate length and is the shortest size on our list. This info may matter if you have long hair and want to style your strands with the as least passes as possible. There are much longer plates in the market such as Conair Double Ceramic with 4.73”, and it offers even a 2” plate width option.\\nIt has multi-directional floating plates which is a great quality that ensures contact between hair and plates at all times.\\nThis tool is convenient for curling hair as it has rounded-edged plates for less creasing.\\nChi Original Lava Ceramic is one of the shortest flat irons on our list with only 10.25”. This can be beneficial if you travel with your flat iron and want a compact tool.\\nVariable heat setting is a very important feature that allows you to choose the perfect temperature for your strands without damaging them and for optimal results. Chi Original Lava Ceramic Flat Iron is the only tool on our list that doesn’t have temperature control. It has a maximum temperature of 395F, and there’s no way to adjust it to make it more or less. This temperature is convenient for thick hair types that need high levels of heat to tame. But if you have fine and fragile hair, you will need temperatures much lower than that. It certainly is not the right tool for fine hair and if that’s the case, there are many options on our list that provide a very gentle session, such as Tymo Sway that goes as low as 140F.\\nHeat of its handle is maximum 80F and is safe to touch. But its cool tip(174F) and back of its plates(177F) both get too hot and should be used with heat protectant glove if you want to touch these areas.\\nThis tool doesn’t have any audible warning when it reaches its maximum temperature, It doesn’t even have auto shot off to make it fire safe. These features are important if you’re a beginner and don’t know how to use the tool, but doesn’t really matter for experienced home stylists.\\nThis tool has ceramic plates which are infused with volcanic lava. First of all, ceramic is known for its gentle styling capacities and it’s much less likely to burn your hair than titanium. It may not be the fastest material, but it’s much more suitable for daily use as well as for beginners. Ceramic is a very common material when it comes to flat irons. Volcanic Lava, on the other hand, is quite unique and this tool is the only flat iron on our list with this material. The quality it brings is mostly about how durable it makes the plates, as well as releasing negative ions for frizz-free results. As much as ceramic is usually a gentle option, in this particular case, this flat iron is still considered a harsh one. Its high and non-adjustable temperature makes this flat iron not suitable for fine hair and if you need a gentle flat iron, you will need another brand such as Bioionic Goldpro Flat iron with ceramic plates as well as 170F minimum heat.\\nIf there is one thing that stands out in Chi hair tools, it’s their material quality. Chi Original Lava Ceramic Hairstyling Iron doesn’t disappoint and it’s one of the most durable products on our list. The volcanic lava coating also helps in this matter. It’s very sturdy to hold and it justifies its cost of $100. We can say that it’s a luxury product with this material quality but as far as luxury tools go, it’s on the cheaper side of the spectrum.\\nChi Original Lava Ceramic Hair Styling Iron weighs 9oz and is considered a medium-weight flat iron. It wouldn’t bother most but if you will use your flat iron for long periods of time and would really love to avoid arm fatigue, we recommend an even lighter tool such as Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron with only 7.9oz.\\nDiameter of its handle is average-sized with 4.5” and fits most hands.\\nIts swivel cord is 11ft long which is a very generous size and longer than most. It may come handy in case your plug is not right next you mirror.\\nIt has dual voltage so that you can use it anywhere in the world, and considering is weight and size, this is a quite compact tool that is travel-friendly.\\nIt doesn’t have digital display nor temperature control which is a big downside. These are very useful features and if you are not very used to using a flat iron, you may want to consider another brand with these qualities. We can’t really say that it’s the most ergonomic tool without these features as it makes things harder for most.\\nChi Original Lava Ceramic, with $100, is a middle priced tool. Chi products are usually considered luxury tools and even though it has its down sides, with this material quality, we can say that it’s definitely value for money. It comes with a 2 year guarantee which is the average number in the market. You can opt for a more luxury tool that has digital display and temperature control, but it will cost much more. A great example would be Bioionic 10X Styling Iron that has everything that a luxury tool has to offer, but costs $240.\\nAs we mentioned above, Chi Original Lava Ceramic Hairstyling Iron is not the gentlest tool on our list and certainly not suitable for fine hair. Fortunately, Chi offers a solution to this issue with its Chi Original Digital Ceramic Hairstyling Iron. It comes with ceramic plates which is the gentlest material, the biggest difference is that it has a minimum setting of 180F which is perfect for delicate strands.\\nAs much as $100 is considered average in the market, we know that not everyone has the budget to spend this much on a flat iron. When we look at more affordable options with similar qualities with Chi, we come across Conair Double Ceramic Flat Iron. It also has ceramic plates and does a decent job taming thick and unruly strands, and it costs only $29.',\n",

Nicknamed the “Man of Bronze,” middle distance runner Phil Edwards won five bronze medals at three Olympic Games in the 4x400m relay (1928 and 1932), 800m (1932 and 1936) and 1,500m (1932). He was the most decorated Canadian Olympian until 2002, when speed skater Marc Gagnon won his fifth medal, tying Edwards’s record. In 1936, Edwards became the first recipient of the Lou Marsh Trophy as top athlete in the country. A graduate of McGill University medical school and star of the university’s track team, Edwards later became a leading expert in tropical diseases.\\nEarly Life and Education\\nPhil Edwards was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, to a family of 13 children. His father was a magistrate, and the family was part of the Black elite in the British colony. Edwards attended the prestigious Queen’s College in Georgetown and, at age 16, dominated track events at the school. After graduating, he left British Guiana and moved to the United States, enrolling at New York University (NYU), where elder brother “King” was already a student athlete. Edwards’ parents and several of his siblings also emigrated to New York, where they founded a law and real estate firm in Harlem (one of his sisters became the first Black female lawyer in New York state). Under the guidance of NYU coach Emil Von Elling, Edwards steadily improved as a runner, particularly in 880-yard races (roughly equivalent to 800 m). In the summer of 1927, for example, he narrowly missed winning the US national title in the 880-yard event.\\nDespite his obvious talent, Edwards could not compete for a spot on the US Olympic team as he wasn’t a citizen and, at the time, his home country, British Guiana, did not have an Olympic team. However, as a British subject, Edwards was eligible to compete for another country within the empire. In 1927, Melville Marks “Bobby” Robinson invited him to join the Canadian team for the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. (Robinson, who was manager of the track and field team, had also helped found the Hamilton Olympic Club and would later bring the first British Empire Games to Hamilton, Ontario, in 1930.) In late June 1928, Edwards competed at the Canadian Olympic trials in Hamilton, winning the national title in the 800m and qualifying for the Games. At the Amsterdam Games, he placed fourth in the 800m and won a bronze medal as a member of the 4X400m relay team.\\nAfter the 1928 Games, Edwards returned to NYU to complete his studies, but continued his association with the Hamilton Olympic Club. In 1929, he travelled between the United States and Canada, competing in track meets in both countries. In August, for example, The Globe reported that he had starred at an athletic competition held in Ottawa:\\nThe Central Canada exhibition came to a close yesterday with the holding of a mammoth sports program, featured by the appearance of Canada’s great half-miler, Phil Edwards. The member of last year’s Canadian Olympic team, running in the colors of the Hamilton Olympic Club, was the stellar performer in a program which was studded with keen competition and brilliant performances by the best of Ontario’s schoolboy athletes. The dusky flier had no strong competition, but he gave an impressive and pleasing display to capture both the 880-yard senior run and the one-mile run.\\nDid you know?\\nThe Globe newspaper referred to Phil Edwards as the “dusky knight of the cinder paths,” while a 1932 article in the Montreal Gazette referred to him as “Dusky Phil.” The term “dusky” means “dark,” and was commonly used to refer to people with darker complexions, particularly those of African ancestry.\\nEdwards continued to make headlines in the Globe, including reports about his personal life (“Phil Edwards to Marry,” 7 October 1929) and his academic plans following graduation from NYU in May 1930 (“Phil Edwards Plans to Attend Cambridge,” 2 May 1930).\\nMcGill University Star Athlete\\nDespite his earlier plans to attend Cambridge law school, Edwards eventually decided to apply to medical school and, in 1931, enrolled in first-year medicine at McGill University. In June 1931, the Globe informed its readers of the news, remarking “the coming of the stellar middle-distance runner boosts McGill chances in the forthcoming track events, for Edwards is recognized as superior to any Canadian runner at his distances.” He lived up to his reputation, leading the McGill track team to six consecutive championships from 1931 to 1936.\\nThe “Man of Bronze” at the 1932 Games\\nEdwards again competed for Canada at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California. During the 800m final, he set out at a blistering pace and led the race at the halfway point. However, at the final turn he was caught by Canadian teammate Alex Wilson and British runner Tom Hampson, both of whom broke the world record. Hampson won the race, with Wilson second, while Edwards hung on to take third.\\nHe also won a bronze medal in the 1,500m, beating such favourites as American GlennCunningham and New Zealand runner John “Jack” Edward Lovelock. Edwards picked up a third bronze medal as part of the 4X400m relay team, along with Alex Wilson, James Ball and Raymond Lewis (the first Canadian-born Black man to win an Olympic medal).\\nDid you know?\\nPhil Edwards won 3 bronze medals at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. In total, he would win 5 bronze medals at the Olympics from 1928 to 1936.\\nThe 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin\\nEdwards continued to train and race between the 1932 and 1936 Olympic Games, winning a number of titles, including a gold medal in the half mile at the 1934 British Empire Games in London (at the 1930 and 1934 British Empire Games, he was part of the Guianese rather than the Canadian team).\\nA veteran competitor, Edwards was chosen captain of the Canadian track and field team for the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Also on the team was Sam Richardson, a Black track and field athlete from Toronto. Many Canadians (and Americans) wanted to boycott the 1936 Olympic Games because of Nazi Germany’s treatment of Jews and its ideology of White supremacy. However, others felt that participation in the Olympics would be a more effective challenge to Nazi ideology. In addition to Edwards and Richardson, Jewish basketball star Irving \"Toots\" Meretsky competed at the Games as part of the Canadian Olympic team.\\nEdwards won his fifth bronze medal at the 1936 Olympic Games when he was narrowly beaten by Italian runner Mario Lanzi for second place in the 800m final. He then placed a respectable fifth in the 1,500m.\\nDid you know?\\nJesse Owens, the African American track star, won four medals at the 1936 Games: in the 100m, 200m, 4X100m relay and the long jump. The success of Black athletes such as Owens and Edwards was cheered by Canadian and American reporters, but prompted Germany’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to remark that, “White people should be ashamed of themselves.”\\nIronically, Edwards himself experienced racial discrimination not in Germany, but in London, England, as the Canadian team prepared to return home. When the team checked into a hotel, they discovered that the staff wouldn’t allow Edwards to register as a guest. Outraged on behalf of their captain, the entire team decided to leave (according to some accounts, Edwards was eventually allowed to register at the hotel, while others suggest the team found alternate accommodations).\\nLater that year, Edwards became the first recipient of the Lou Marsh Trophy, awarded to Canada’s top athlete, as well as the Lionel Conacher Award for best male athlete.\\nEdwards graduated from McGill University’s medical school in 1936. Although many assumed he would return to British Guiana to practise medicine, he instead accepted a three-year position at the General Hospital in Barbados as resident house surgeon. During the Second World War, Edwards served with the Canadian Army as a captain and was stationed in British Columbia, near the Pacific theatre. After the war he returned to McGill, earning a graduate medical diploma in tropical diseases in 1945. He remained in Montréal, eventually becoming head of the parasitology department at the Royal Victoria Hospital. An acknowledged expert in tropical diseases, tuberculosis and chest diseases, he was also a consultant for the Canadian government.\\nDid you know?\\nAlthough Phil Edwards is sometimes identified as the first Black graduate of McGill University’s medical school, this is incorrect. Charles Lightfoot Roman, for example, graduated from McGill’s medical school in 1919.\\nEdwards died on 6 September 1971—about two weeks before his 64th birthday—after a six-month illness. According to his obituary in the Globe and Mail, he had previously had surgery for cancer, but had later been “confined because of a heart ailment.” Edwards left behind wife Dianne and their three daughters.\\nEdwards was Canada’s most decorated Olympian for about 70 years. Before the 1932 Olympic Summer Games in Los Angeles, a number of Canadian athletes (George Orton, Robert Kerr, Percy Williams, Fanny Rosenfeld and Ethel Smith) had each won a total of two Olympic medals. When Edwards took three bronze medals at the 1932 Games alone, he entered the record books. His career total of five Olympic medals would not be met until Marc Gagnon won his fifth speed skating medal in 2002.\\nThe most significant of his medals is probably his last: the bronze he won in the 800m at the 1936 Games in Berlin. There, Edwards, like American track star Jesse Owens, disproved the lie of Aryan supremacy spouted by the Nazi regime. Following his death in 1971, the Globe and Mail remarked that his “bronze medal in the 800-meter run and his fifth place in the 1,500-meter race in Berlin in 1936 not only added to Canada’s totals, but added Dr. Edwards to the ranks of black athletes from many countries who shot holes in Hitler’s pure Aryan track army on its home grounds.”\\nRacial discrimination was and would remain a problem in Canada. During this period, Black Canadians were effectively segregated in many public spaces, Jewish Canadians faced widespread social, professional and economic discrimination, and Chinese people were banned from immigrating to the country. However, Edwards was much loved and admired, by his teammates and the public. A five-time Olympic medallist and Olympic team captain, he became a popular figure in Canada, with newspapers styling him the “dusky knight of the cinder paths.” The first recipient of the Lou Marsh Award for best athlete in the country, Edwards became a hero to many Canadians.\\nDid You Know?\\nAt the time, races were run on cinder tracks — these were constructed from a variety of materials, including small rocks and coal ash. The 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo were the last to use cinder running tracks. All subsequent Games and major international competitions have used synthetic running surfaces. As synthetic tracks provide a superior running surface, it can be misleading to compare the times of modern runners to those from earlier eras.\\nHonours and Awards',\n",
       " \"Many students have physical or learning disabilities that make it difficult for them to learn through traditional styles of instruction. To help these students succeed, school systems offer an altered curriculum and/or instructional approach. These changes are called modifications, adaptations or accommodations.\\nThere are no set definitions for the terms modification, adaptation and accommodation. As a result, these terms often get used imprecisely and interchangeably. Generally, modifications and adaptations refer to individualized curriculum changes that reduce the difficulty and size of a student's workload. Accommodations, however, usually refer to tools and techniques that help students keep up with a standard workload identical to that of their peers. In other words, modifications and adaptations change what a student is expected to learn while accommodations change how a student learns.\\nSpecial needs populations include students with learning disabilities, ADHD, autism, emotional disturbances, low IQ, blindness, deafness and mobility limitations. For academic subjects, students with only physical limitations will usually receive accommodations, not modifications or adaptations; for gym class, however, they may follow a modified or adapted curriculum. Students with ADHD who have a high IQ may also need only a few accommodations to succeed; more severe cases may warrant a modified or adapted curriculum. The same is true for children with autism and learning disabilities. Gifted children and children who speak a language other than English are also considered part of the special needs population; they may also receive modifications or accommodations.\\nStudents receiving modifications or adaptations are usually given less input; this means they receive less material to memorize or learn, and their assignments are shorter and easier than those given to the rest of the class. Modifications can also apply to students' output. They will be expected to recall or generate fewer details, and they may not be required to participate at the same level as their peers. Students requiring a modified or adapted curriculum have their own individual goals, and they take special modified versions of standardized tests.\\nOften students with modified or adapted curricula also receive accommodations. Accommodations for input include sign language interpreters, books in Braille and audio-taped books. Output accommodations include allowing a student to take an oral test instead of a written test. Other accommodations include allowing the use of calculators, providing graphic organizers and giving a student extra time to complete an assignment. If accommodations allow a child to succeed, he will not need a modified or adapted curriculum.\\nModified or adapted curricula allow students with special needs to continue learning at a pace they can keep up with. They also allow them to take part in the social aspects of student life. A modified physical education curriculum may make it possible to expect a student with physical disabilities to participate in an athletic activity, and the learning and fun that goes with it.\\nLinda Basilicato has been writing food and lifestyle articles since 2005 for newspapers and online publications such as eHow.com.

       " 'Sunday\\'s Golden Globes: They were fast-moving and improbable, sort of like The Hangover. Also? There were more snubs than you could shake your DNA-sharing braid at. But, like every year, famous people came out to show us that they\\'re just like our families: a bit more fun after three drinks.\\nHere is a full list of the winners that were.\\nTo read the comments in chronological order, click here.\\nClick the Image to View Our Gallery of the Red Carpet at This Year\\'s Golden Globes\\n10:57—Julia Roberts came out to drag the curtain down on this party, with her maharajah ruby necklace. (It symbolizes \"wealth,\" or \"spirituality\" or something.) And the win of the night? She seems a little disappointed. And she should be. Quentin Tarantino looks cranky. Kathryn Bigelow certainly should be cranky. Daniel Day-Lewis? Definitely sorta disturbed by Avatar.\\nI do think that what will happen is that there will be a fight, at some point, regarding animated movies, and CGI movies, and old-fashioned movies without motion capture. James Cameron\\'s attempt to be inclusive--\"pat yourselves on the back!\"--is not playing in this crowd, because this is a bit \"us v. them\" at this point. There are clearly some, even in this crowd, who think that the likes of Avatar is just capitalism and not so much a chance for actors to ply their craft. (Don\\'t tell that to Sam Worthington though.)\\nSo: Golden Globes, 2028. Will it have a 3-D-only Best Picture category? Will it have a no-CGI Best Picture category? Will the finance people agree with the art crowd that Tarantino & Bigelow are making substantially different categories of filmed entertainment from Bigelow\\'s ex-husband?\\nIn other news, Christian Slater has already hit the afterparty. And I think it\\'s time to join him. Here\\'s to 2010: maybe a better year in movies.\\n10:56—Best motion picture, drama, goes to Avatar.\\n10:48—Jeff Bridges did, in fact, grow up in Westwood, so it is improbable that he has that folksy, earnest, backwoods accent. However! His folksy, earnest, backwoods face? He earned that, through living. It is terrific: the deep wrinkles, the double dimples. He got those by living large. We are now image-Googling for pictures of his stand-in, whom he thanked. Has his stand-in lived as hard and as terrifically? Only his face can tell the story of so many decades, lived so close to the edge.\\n10:47—Best actor in a drama goes to Jeff Bridges.\\n10:41—Remember when Robert Downey Jr. was circling the drain? All strung out and missing and nearly donezo? That was a near miss. What would we have done without him? He became the most delightful man around.\\n10:40—Robert Downey Jr. wins best actor in a comedy or musical.\\n10:37—Sandy Bullock Strikes Back! The Revenge of the Bullock! Romancing the Bullock! Sandy Bullock 2: Electric Bugaloo! America\\'s Old Sweetheart is Once Again America\\'s New Sweetheart! And you know, I\\'m not sad to have her back. (Just remember Miss Congeniality. Good times, those were.)\\n10:36—Sandra Bullock wins best actress in a drama for The Blind Side.\\n10:33—It\\'s amazing that the governor of California isn\\'t being pelted with glasses and rotten fruit. Hello, the state is bankrupt and here we all are, while people are probably looting five blocks away. Instead everyone there is laughing and applauding. And this is why they hate liberal Hollywood.\\n10:29—You know, Best Comedy or Musical as a category was wide-open, and that is a true reflection of the problems of 2009. Movies and comedies were troubled. This category is full of small, or troubled, or iffy, or niche movies. So why not The Hangover? At least it made money! People saw the holy heck outta that movie. You know why? Because it was oh-so- raunchy and the kids today like the risque, and the dirty language and the sexual situations. (This is why in 20 years there will be an award-sweeping movie that stars a bunch of people\\'s butts. But that\\'s OK!)\\n10:19— Glee wins for best TV series, comedy or musical.\\n10:18—My party has gotten as drunk as the audience at the Hilton, and this means that they were underwhelmed by James Cameron\\'s win for best director but a little bit excited that he can still remember his made-up Na\\'avi language, which you know what? There are not Internet Usenet groups devoted to Na\\'avi. The kids are not blogging in Na\\'avi. It is not Klingon. It\\'s not really all the rage at all!\\n10:15—James Cameron wins best director for Avatar.\\n10:14—It\\'s weird that it feels TOO SOON for Mel Gibson drunk jokes. (I think Ricky Gervais got booed a little when he basically called Gibson a Drunky McDrunk? Or were they booing Gibson? Which!) I mean, everyone (that matters) in the room is Jewish! Have we all really gotten over that incident? I pretty much haven\\'t!\\n10:02—Da Vinci, Picasso, Beethoven... Scorsese! Do you think that might be true? Or is it completely improbable? Or will no one remember Beethoven maybe—like, in the year 2178, will Lady Gaga be more important? In any event. This Scorsese tribute is in fact an exceptional montage. The King of Comedy is really the greatest movie ever, ever, ever.\\n9:52—This is a win everyone can get behind: Christoph Waltz! I mean, we all loved his work in Die Zürcher Verlobung... Kidding! We love it when a kooky and excellent fifty-something Austrian who actually knows how to act gets to hang out with famous people!\\n9:51—Christoph Waltz wins best supporting actor in a movie for Inglourious Basterds.\\n9:48—Chloe Sevigny wins best supporting actress in a TV series or movie for Big Love.\\n9:41—Christina Hendricks! That is amazing. (Almost as amazing as Jon Hamm\\'s beard.) She is a stunning woman. Do you think in 60 years she will be on this stage again, in the Sophia Loren role, and everyone will give her a standing ovation and cry?\\n9:39— Mad Men won for best TV drama.\\n9:37—I guess it is OK that Michael Haneke beat out Pedro Almodovar. But It is not OK that they cut to ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER during Haneke\\'s speech just because they are both Austrian, that is just plain old racist.\\n9:36—Michael Haneke\\'s The White Ribbon wins best foreign film.\\n9:33—It\\'s amazing that the Sophia Loren appearance is the highlight of the evening. This suggests that there is a little bit of a lack of pizazz tonight? That no one quite knows what to do in the face of Haiti? The room here erupted: \"This outfit could be from the \\'80s you don\\'t know!\" \"OMG what!\" \"Yay, love her glasses.\" \"When they go outside they become sunglasses!\" \"Do not make fun of Sophia Loren! You cannot make fun of Sophia Loren!\"\\n9:27—Best comedy actor in a TV show goes to Alec Baldwin for 30 Rock. (And wasn\\'t there to accept it.)\\n9:24—Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner win best screenplay for Up in the Air.\\n9:23—Ricky Gervais\\' beard is getting thicker as the evening goes on, right? It\\'s like some fast-motion Fantastic Mr. Fox animation.\\n9:18—I\\'m going to say something! Maybe I am not supposed to say this? But... are there any other black people at this awards show besides the fine people at the Precious table? Oh, yes, hello Chiwetel Ejiofor! But... is that it? And can I get an Asian? (Related: What happened to Lucy Liu? Did Code Name: The Cleaner finally do her in? She was awesome.)\\n9:15—Hey, now! Old New Drew Barrymore, come back! Remember that interlude of responsible adulthood between crazy behavior in front of David Letterman years ago and tonight\\'s crazy Golden Globes speech? It was nice. We would like to turn back the clock to that again pretty please.\\n9:14—For Grey Gardens, Drew Barrymore wins for best actress in a TV miniseries or movie.\\n9:11—Kevin Bacon wins for best actor in a TV miniseries or movie for Taking Chance.\\n9:05—A few important notes:\\n- Jeanne Tripplehorn looked AMAZING in the background, behind Rachael Horovitz accepting the award for the fantastic Grey Gardens. It would be the greatest if she helmed a reboot of Catwoman.\\n- You cannot call Meryl Streep \"greedy,\" Colin Farrell.\\n- This is fantastic that Meryl Streep gets to give another speech. Take five minutes on YouTube and search Meryl Streep Acceptance Speech. There\\'s quite a few, obviously! And they are all exquisite.\\n- This Meryl Streep speech? Absolutely in her Top Five. It\\'s like a hot bath of Meryl Streep. The tribute to her mother? And you know what? They do not turn the music on for Meryl Streep. You do not hush the Streep! The Streep will be show you how it is done and she is done at exactly the right moment.\\n9:01—For best performance by an actress in a comedy, Meryl Streep won for Julie and Julia. (She was also nominated in the same category for It\\'s Complicated.)\\n8:55— Grey Gardens won for best miniseries or TV movie.\\n8:48—Michael Giacchino wins for best score for Up\\n8:47—One joke that never gets old is saying \"I see you\" to people, a la Avatar. It is the greatest, especially when they\\'re mad at you. Like at the deli, when they\\'re tired of waiting for you to find change. \"I SEE YOU.\"\\n8:46—\"The Weary Kind\" from Crazy Heart wins best original song, motion picture.\\n8:44—I\\'m sorry, I blacked out for a minute during Cher and Christina Aguilera? You can\\'t just spring that on people like us (gays) in the audience! Listen, they both looked amazing but kind of insane—one who had the \"fake boob out\" cutaway dress, and the other who had some sort of postmodern semi-corset? I sort of lost my mind and I can\\'t even recover, but they did look like some kind of astral projection from Planet Amazing Sexual Crisis.\\n8:39—Did you know that The Good Wife has like 14 million or so viewers each episode, on average? A huge number of people watch this show! It is insanely popular. And Julianna thanked Les Moonves for keeping dramas on at 10 o\\'clock, zing Jeff Zucker. Should I be watching this? This is a slightly odd awards show.\\nDexter and Tara are a very unlikely couple.\\n8:36—Julianna Margulies wins for best actress in a television series drama for The Good Wife.\\n8:34—Michael C. Hall wins for best actor in a television series drama.\\n8:33—Neil Patrick Harris\\' shirt was perfect, right? It\\'s blindingly white. And this is a hot category he\\'s introducing--Hot Man In A Drama. It\\'s impossible to have known who to have rooted for in this one! Jon Hamm\\'s beard has been uprooting young women\\'s feelings all over the Internet. (Just ask Twitter and Tumblr. Jon Hamm\\'s beard is the biggest winner here tonight.)\\n8:23—Tonight\\'s theme is that pretty much everyone is having trouble above the forehead. I know that sounds mean, but we have HD now in America, and, we can see things we were never meant to see. Paul McCartney\\'s hair dye is just off. But the guy from Up, is very hot in a really young Frankenstein way. He has great hair. And, apparently, two children, who he thanks. Aww.\\n8:12—This awards show is going as fast as the American attention span! Toni Collette, beating out Tina Fey, is very nearly forced to admit that no one watches her very fine show. Her dress? Golden and A+. Her speech? Sweet and short. Took less time than Paul McCartney\\'s umbrella took to pass on the red carpet.\\n8:11—Because Mo\\'Nique wins for best supporting for Precious.\\n8:10—The Haiti Issue was been disposed of without much fuss, by Nicole Kidman. This is both seemly and sort of disappointing. And yet we have our most fabulous moment of the evening, with Mo\\'Nique beating out Julianne Moore\\'s enormous, multi-billion dollar earrings. This is going to be a strange new world when Mo\\'Nique is like stomping in and out of CAA and taking meetings with Brad Pitt\\'s production company. Annnnnd she just regained all the status she sort of tossed away by being \"difficult\" and \"troublesome\" according to the blogs on the Internet!\\n8:03—Tonight already has the charming feel of a very rich high-school reunion. It\\'s cute! It looks swank, and doesn\\'t have that overstuffed, enormous Oscar feel. It\\'s small, and lewd, and drinky--and the loudmouth guy from math class is up at the podium.\\nNewly invented Haiti ribbons everywhere and the world\\'s most immense emeralds on Julianne Moore! My God. It\\'s important to note just how shiny Ricky Gervais is. This is unacceptable. There are handy products made by Lancome for this purpose. In any event, Ricky Gervais is sort of killing. With his pint in hand.\\n7:57—Don\\'t you love how it\\'s a crisis when it rains a little in Los Angeles? \"Good luck, STAY DRY!\" has been the way to say goodbye from the red carpet folks.\\nIn other news, the guy who plays the stupid guy on True Blood... doesn\\'t sound all that smart in real life. Who would have thought.\\nAlso, Ryan Seacrest is head and shoulders above Billy Bush, in terms of \"skills\" (at least on the red carpet). Also Tina Fey got her outfit from Beetlejuice cast-offs.\\nAnd the JETS WON! WHOO!',\n",
       " 'Sign up for smart news, insights, and analysis on the biggest financial stories of the day.\\nIn the 1990 movie “Total Recall,” an exasperated Arnold Schwarzenegger had to commandeer a Johnny Cab from an annoyingly incompetent automaton driver to make his getaway. Uber is hoping passenger-robot relations have evolved since then.\\nTwo years after selling its autonomous division, Uber is driving full speed into the robotaxi business yet again. On Thursday, the rideshare pioneer inked a 10-year deal with Motional, a driverless vehicle joint venture between Hyundai and Aptive. Success is by no means automatic.\\nI’m Not an Ambiturner\\nThe automotive industry — rideshare companies in particular — is obsessed with driverless tech. Uber co-founder and two-star CEO Travis Kalanick put it simply in a 2014 interview with The Verge: “When there’s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” Fortune Business Insights projects the autonomous car market could reach $11 billion by the end of this decade.\\nBut chasing the dream has led the companies down a pot-marked road with little to show for it. Carmakers poured more than $100 billion into robocar R&D over the past decade, according to a McKinsey report. Yet, driverless cars struggle in weather worse than partly cloudy. Even traffic cones and simple left turns have flustered robodrivers.\\nUber’s partnership with Motional puts the company back in the game while outsourcing the more pesky tech problems to a third party:\\n- Uber launched an autonomous driving unit, Uber ATG, in 2015, only to find that meeting its ambitious goals proved too costly. The company — which never touched profitability until late last year — burned over $20 million a month in autonomous R&D and suffered a PR nightmare when one of its test cars killed a pedestrian; the unit was sold off to Aurora in December 2020.\\n- Uber and Motional promised to have robotaxis ferrying people and delivering food orders by the end of the year, rolling out first in multiple yet-to-be-named US markets. They claimed the driverless cars would “ultimately lead to reduced wait times and lower fares,” combining Motional’s driverless tech with Uber’s treasure chest of passenger behavior and city-mapping data.\\nDown the road: Uber is hardly the only one betting big on self-driving cars. Lyft and Motional have been servicing free robotaxis in Las Vegas for years, and just last week Uber’s chief competitor teamed up with the Ford-backed Argo AI to launch a similar program in Miami and Austin. GM-subsidiary Cruise is operating in San Francisco with plans to hit Austin and Phoenix, which is already populated by Google’s Waymo, by year’s end. Let’s hope we don’t find out the hard way if Johnny Cab’s driving has gotten any better.',\n",

       " \"What does SVG Mean?\\nSVG stands for scalable vector graphics. It’s an image type ideally suited for simple, clean designs like logos, website graphics, and, of course, laser cutting machines. Put simply, an SVG file is a kind of digital graphic that is super easy for your cutting machine to read and interpret, even when you're working with lots of different layers.\\nYes, they can be made smaller or larger without affecting the quality of the image. You know when you zoom in too far on a photo and it gets fuzzy and pixelated? That doesn't happen with an SVG file. So if you want to use the same design for your coffee cup and your new laptop decal, you can easily change the size of the image to fit and your lines will come out nice and sharp both times.\\nYes, SVG cut files allow you to include multiple layers in a single image without confusing your cutting software. That means that the graphic you see on the computer screen looks exactly how the final project will look. There is no need to create separate files for each layer and keep track of how they fit together. This is extremely helpful for designing complex cutting patterns and will save you a lot of time and planning.\\nWhen you put a regular PNG image file into your cutting machine program, the computer can only see the outline of the image. This works fine if you want to cut out one solid shape. For more complicated projects with many different layers and varying levels of intricacy, SVG cut files are the way to go. All of the layers are coded into the one file, and your machine will be able to tell exactly where to cut for each section.\\nDifferent cutting machines will use different programs, but most (if not all) will take SVG cut files. All of the designs on The Digital Files site are compatible with any cutting machine and laser machine programs that uses SVG cut files.\",\n",
       " \"Housebreaking, chewing, barking, itching, scratching? Spay-neuter? Toenails, mange, microchipping, lost dog? Breeders, veterinarians, and trainers provide expert answers in the world's 1st dog-site.\\nDog Activities To Alleviate Boredom\\nby Karen Rhodes, Family Dog Consultant\\nHave you ever come home to total chaos created by your beloved house dog? Does your dog display behavior issues such as chewing on objects or himself?\\nDo you hear a heavy sigh from your pooch when you want to relax from the work-a-day grind and your dog wants to play? Barring any health concerns, does your dog show lack of ambition, or ever look forlorn and lost?\\nAll of this is common for dog owners who do not involve their dogs in physical and mental activities. Dogs get bored. Dogs were meant to hunt, to trot for miles, to exert tremendous energy chasing and catching prey. Being intelligent creatures, dogs will either look for non-boring activities or turn inward, becoming disinterested in life in general.\\nDogs are social animals; historically pack animals. Now with extreme domestication, dogs rely on their humans to be their “everything”. We are their buddies, teachers, friends, companions, exercise partners, providers, health care workers, etc. Prematurely separated from their dam and littermates, it is we who must teach puppies to be better companions. But they also educate us because by tuning into your dog you can be a better owner and have a happier, better behaved animal.\\nCertain breed behaviors may not be suitable to your lifestyle. Look up the Breed Standards and learn whether they are active, laid-back or protective. Pay attention to these when selecting a dog. If you acquire a mixed breed be prepared to learn on the fly because its behavior, personality, and activity requirements are less predictable. If possible visit the prospective adoptee several times, noting whether the demeanor and personality will fit your style and needs.\\nIf considering a purebred dog, use your experience and information readily available to pair with the right pooch and you both will prosper in your relationship.\\nCertain instincts and behaviors have been ingrained into a pure-breed dog and are described in the AKC Breed Standard. They can be generalized into a breed characteristic or standard. General knowledge of breed type and activity level can help you with your choice. Dog breeds are not categorized haphazardly, retrievers generally retrieve, herding breeds herd; “working dogs” work and so on. Some dogs are quite content with a couch potato lifestyle; others live for physical challenges, mental stimulation and excitement.\\nDon’t let trends or a popular television show influence your breed choice. There is some bad information out there, many playing on your heartstrings instead of your logical mind as to selecting a dog you are compatible with. If dog breeders and dog professionals say a breed tends to be; “stubborn”, “needy”, “not recommended for first time owners”, “are not to be off leash”, “very physical”, this information is probably true.\\nAge and physical characteristics of dog has a huge impact on ability and physical stamina so it is up to you to adapt an activity to the age and ability of the type dog. Remembering we are also responsible for their safety. For example, some breeds of dogs are recommended to have a fenced in area or be on leash whenever they are outside. I purchased a beagle pup years ago, she was a gorgeous dog and was very family friendly. I lived in a very rural area in the woods. My son and I trained this beautiful little girl, but Jewel would run every trail her nose came upon. I would often have to go searching for her because and trailing/tracking instincts were so strong nothing would get her to return to us upon command.\\nWe ended up re-homing her to a wonderful man who enjoys hunting with dogs. His experience with beagles paid off and she became not only his most prized hunting canine but his life-long companion.\\nBefore deciding on a breed or type of dog, think about your lifestyle and dog-friendly things you enjoy. We like to participate in; shows, visit dog parks, go for rides in the car, we hike, we go for swims, an occasional trip to the grooming parlor. I enjoy inventing new dog-games, compete in agility games, visiting individuals who are “shut ins, therapy work, obedience trials, camping trips. Don’t let physical limitations of the dog, your friends, or your own limit challenges or limit your imagination. Get creative; explore options and alternatives. Companionship is beneficial to both you and your dog.\\nSeasons can affect the type of activities you and your dog can participate in. Extreme weather can be most annoying when your dog is displaying “cabin fever” wanting to get outside to play. Indoor play, car rides and other forms of entertainment can break the monotony. Using common object such as cardboard boxes, toilet paper tubes, marrow bones, toys (both bought and created) keep even my youngest dog satisfied when the weather is not so accommodating.\\nA few minutes to a few hours of spending “quality time” with your dog can be a blessing for you both. Dog activities based on physical exercise and mental stimulation helps both dog and owner health and emotional well-being. It can have your dog looking forward to your next adventure instead of becoming bored engaging in maladaptive behaviors or becoming personality stagnant, overweight, unhappy or seriously depressed.\\nI consider my dogs family and we love our adventures and outings. When ‘out and about’ we follow pet rules of hygiene, practice courtesy, soak up sunshine, give and receive blessings, and our lives are better for these dog-related activities.\\nTheDogPlace.org EST 1998 © Apr. 20192207 https://www.thedogplace.org/Training/dog-activities-to-alleviate-boredom-k19R05.asp\\nBrought to you by the NetPlaces Network\\nThe world’s 1st public website TheDogPlace.org from Animal Health to Vaccines.\\nThe world's 1st online dog news, TheDogPress.com from AKC records to zoological news.\\nThe world's 1st site by/for dog show judges TheJudgesPlace.com educates on purebred dogs.\",\n",
       " 'Electrification is having profound impacts on the automotive industry. Electric aircraft may have a similar impact on the aerospace sector.\\nAttracted by the low weight and cost of electric motors compared with gas turbine jet engines, and particularly by their near-silent operation and potential for zero emissions, the civil aviation sector is showing increasing interest in using electricity to power future flight, at least over the relatively short distances that dominate city-to-city aviation.\\nWhile jets are unassailable as the prime movers for intercontinental long-haul airliners — nobody’s suggesting that electric aircraft could transport passengers from Europe to Asia, across the Atlantic or even between the East and West coasts of the US — the short-haul routes between both European and US cities, currently plied mostly by twin-engined single-aisle aircraft, are the targets for a new generation of radically different aircraft whose development is being fostered by the aerospace majors. These machines could take the sector into areas of science and technology very different from those it is used to.\\nOf the two biggest players in civil aviation, Airbus is taking the more active role in this initiative by developing its own aircraft, while Boeing has invested in a start-up company that is conducting the process. Airbus’s plans have undergone considerable change, however.\\nThe last time The Engineer covered this subject in detail was in an interview with the then-chief technology officer of Airbus, Jean Botti, in late 2015. Electric aircraft were a major focus of Botti’s tenure as CTO but he left the company in April 2016. His successor, while still attaching considerable importance to the project, has proved to have different ideas about how it should be conducted.\\nPaul Eremenko joined Airbus in 2015 to launch and run its Silicon Valley-based innovation offshoot, A3; he took over the CTO’s position in June 2016. An aeronautics and astronautics graduate, he has worked at DARPA — where he headed the office responsible for drones, satellites, robotics and X-planes — and at Motorola and Google, where he initiated development of modular, customisable smartphones. In a lecture at Purdue University in 2014, he stated that his career had been motivated partly by a desire to build a starship, and while at DARPA he was involved in a study to define an organisation that might meet such a goal.\\nOn moving to Airbus, one of Eremenko’s first actions was to revamp the E-Fan electric aircraft project. The first E-Fan, a two-seater with two 30kW electric motors, flew in 2014, crossing the English Channel as a symbolic feat. Airbus’s original plan was to develop this light aircraft further: a production version was slated for 2017 and marketed as a pilot trainer; and a four-seat version with a hybrid powertrain was due to fly in 2019, in which a kerosene-fuelled engine would act as a range extender, operating a generator to charge the batteries and boosting endurance to around three-and-a-half hours.\\nA hybrid configuration – E-Fan Plus, with a 68hp (50kW) two-stroke combustion engine from German manufacturer Solo Aircraft Systems, capable of 30 minutes’ battery endurance and up to two hours 15 minutes in hybrid mode – was developed and flown in 2016, but subsequent plans for the electric aircraft project changed.\\n“To put it simply, we decided that this plan was just not ambitious enough,” Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus general manager for electrification, told The Engineer.\\nElectric aircraft development has continued under Siemens, which in 2016 formed a partnership with Airbus after co-sponsoring – but not providing equipment for – E-Fan. Siemens supplied the 50kg, 260kW motor for an Extra 330LE aerobatic aircraft that first took to the air in July 2016. An order of magnitude more powerful than the E-Fan, this aircraft spurred Airbus to abandon its roadmap of gradual power increases from the kW to the MW range, as Botti had envisaged, and instead look to progress directly to a 2MW demonstrator, as a stepping stone to a hybrid-drive aircraft that could match current single-aisle, short-haul aircraft in terms of range and passenger capacity, and operate from conventional airports. Such an aircraft would likely be another order of magnitude more powerful than the 2MW demonstrator, Llewellyn said.\\n“We might be able to do that in a single step; we might not,” he told The Engineer. “We expect to encounter all sorts of challenges in developing the 2MW aircraft; we just don’t know what all of those might be yet. It’s those ‘unknown unknowns’ that make it difficult to predict how we’d take the step after that.”\\nThe 2MW option has its own goals as a basis for urban aerial mobility vehicles. This sector – currently mostly speculative, of course – was one that Airbus had barely targeted before Eremenko’s appointment but, at the Geneva motor show in March this year, the company unveiled the result of a collaboration with Italian automotive development house Italdesign: a modular concept vehicle called Pop.Up. This consisted of a two-seater passenger capsule that could be linked to an electric ground module (essentially a four-wheeled chassis) or an octocopter air module.\\nAirbus’s ambitions in this sector are likely to favour a larger-capacity vehicle, Llewellyn indicated, and not one that could operate in either road or air mode but one that would be able to take off and land from ‘vertiports’ within cities. “Electric propulsion is ideally suited to urban environments because it’s so quiet, which is important when you want to fly near occupied buildings and at low altitude. And, when you’re in pure electric mode, operating off batteries, you’re producing no emissions and are not affecting air quality,” he said.\\nHowever, Llewellyn would not rule out such vehicles also having a hybrid capability. “It gives us greater flexibility and, of course, with a motor and generator complementing the electric system you can operate in a different mode. A gas turbine acting as a range extender wouldn’t have to handle all the varying loads you encounter during flight – the electric propulsion system would deal with those – so you can optimise its operation so that it runs at maximum efficiency.”\\nSuch hybridisation could be with a hydrogen fuel cell or a gas turbine, or even a diesel engine, coupled to a generator, Llewellyn added. “Even with existing technologies, a hybrid could have significant range.”\\nAnother factor in favour of hybrids crops up regularly with electric aircraft: much of the technology required to enable the type of aircraft that industry would like to fly is simply not yet advanced enough.\\n“The power-to-weight ratios for battery technology are still a long way short of what is required,” Llewellyn said. “Current batteries would be far too heavy as the only source of energy to feasibly fly a large passenger aircraft. This is where hybrid solutions, even at low levels, can be of interest. That said, battery research perhaps has the most investment of any technology in the world right now, so we need to prepare ourselves for a future in which this is possible.”\\nPop.Up is not Airbus’s only urban aerial mobility concept. At a presentation to media earlier this year, Eremenko described four other electric technology demonstrator projects: CityAirbus, a multi-propeller vehicle to carry up to four passengers, intended to be autonomous once regulations are in place for such aircraft, which is being developed by Airbus Helicopters and targeted for first flight by 2018; Skyways, a collaboration with the University of Singapore for delivery of small packages by drones, to be tested initially around the university; Vahana, a single-passenger self-piloted VTOL vehicle being developed by A3; and a less tangible A3 project, Voom, an on-demand shared helicopter booking app for megacity dwellers (with applications beyond only electric aircraft).\\nOne thing that hasn’t changed from Botti’s vision is the design philosophy Airbus wants to apply to its larger electric aircraft. Rather than simply ‘bolting on’ engines to the wings or fuselage, it would integrate electric motors into the airframe at multiple points within aerodynamic housings.\\n“One advantage that electric motors have over gas turbine engines is that it’s relatively cheap, in terms of both cost and weight, to add more of them,” Llewellyn said. “But using integration we can explore things like boundary layer ingestion, which could be another way to recover energy.”\\nBoundary layer ingestion uses the air immediately around the aircraft to feed the fans that accelerate air to generate thrust; it reduces drag and, in theory, means that the engines do not have to work so hard, both of which would reduce fuel consumption (or, in the case of electric motors, their demand for electricity). However, it is not a simple matter because boundary layer airflow is distorted, so fans need to be designed to take account of this.\\nAerospace technology is often a matter of trade-offs – for example, material strength\\nis always balanced against lightness – and electrification is no exception. Heat management is often a sticking point, Llewellyn said, with more powerful motors’ components running hotter and therefore requiring more equipment to handle the heat load, so power output must be balanced against the amount of equipment that can be carried. This may also limit the use of another technology whose potential is attractive for electric aviation: superconductivity.\\nThis is another area where technology has not developed to the point of usefulness. “Even the highest-temperature superconductors need to be cooled to about 70° above absolute zero,” Llewellyn said, “so, although you’d gain from the very efficient, low-loss transmission of energy in a superconducting system, you’d have to balance that against the extra mass of all that cooling equipment, plus you’d have to handle the heat extracted from the system.”\\nDevelopment of higher-temperature superconductors could be a sector of fundamental research where the aerospace industry might want to inject funds, he speculated, although these might be limited to projects directly relevant to aviation.',\n",

       " 'I’ve been testing a bunch of hookup sites over the last few years and some are so legit it’s insane. This one in particular here really works better than most. Now, one that doesn’t work all that great is Ultrahookup.com and this is all that you need to know below…Trust me, I’ve left nothing out and have literally covered it all right here!\\nMy Report On UltraHookup.com\\nTable of Contents\\nOkay, so here’s the scoop on this website. UltraHookup.com is just another site owned by Nautell Capital Limited that is online for only one purpose, which is to rip people off. Like thousands of other fraudulent dating sites, this one too has many tricks up its sleeve through which it tries to fool the user.\\nNot Free At All\\nFor one, the site claims to be completely free for a beginning member. But, under the guise of validating the user’s age, they ask for your credit card information. Now, one has to wonder, why would anyone need a valid credit card’s info just to verify age?\\nWell, that’s where the scam starts. Though they claim to not charge the account, members will notice almost immediately that their cards are indeed being charged.\\nCross Sales Suck\\nBut the charges are from porno websites that they haven’t even signed up for. It isn’t a stretch to assume that UltraHookup.com and these other sites have cut an underhanded deal, where the former brings in members and the latter extorts the money.\\nFor a site that claims to have a free membership, a little investigation will reveal that the cost of being a ‘free’ member adds up to around $120 per month. Quite a hefty sum for something that comes gratis.\\nFake Profile Accounts\\nWhen a member finally gets into the site, they are greeted by thumbnails of beautiful local women looking to have a wild romp. But these profiles, as to be expected from a site that is pulling the above scam, are not real. Indeed, the pictures of the women themselves are fake.\\nThese photographs have been lifted from other sites that do not, at least publically, have a connection with Ultrahookup. These fake accounts are created and maintained by employees of the company, and there are no real, interested women behind them at all.\\nFake Instant Messages\\nNot only that, but after logging in, you will also find yourself the lucky recipient of various emails and instant messages which come from these women. But, as already established, these women are fake, so where do these messages come from?\\nWell, they don’t come from a human, for one. These posts are automatically generated by sophisticated computer software called bots, which are programmed to generate such messages and send them to new members to lure them in.\\nThey Want Your Cash\\nWhy go to all the trouble? Because, when a user receives such a text, it is only human for him to want to get in touch with the woman who has shown such interest in him. But the thing is, to do so, they would have to upgrade their membership, which will require them to open up their wallets. This is all in the pursuit of money and does not give any benefit to the user.\\nObviously, since all these women do not exist and are not the ones behind the messages and emails, you will never be able to see them or get in touch with them. If you do choose to throw your money down the drain, you can be sure you’ll get more and more messages from the bots, since their main purpose is to string the person along and keep the money flowing. But there will be no real human interaction since the messages are fake.\\nConclusion: UltraHookup.com Doesn’t Lead To Hookups\\nThis is just another internet scam by Nautell Capital Limited, and you can rest assured that there are many others. The only thing one can do about it is to make sure you inform as many people as you can about the scam. Keep your eyes and ears open, since most of the workings of these frauds are admitted to in the Terms and Conditions pages of these sites.\\nOther hookup sites that suck:',\n",

However, witnessing the bustling river banks near Chichester harbour while on my recent job I felt I could have almost agreed.\\nAs there was an evening that didn’t need catering for I was asked to cook meals and puddings to stock the freezer. I made a few stews, curries, slow cooked lamb shanks and, much to the relief of the hostess, dealt with a load of the pheasants and partridges by making a big game pie. Without the pressure of evening dinner it also allowed a little more time for food shopping and expeditions to the local independent stores scattered in and among the surrounding villages.\\nLocal shopping even went as far as the wine by using the nearby Nyetimber vineyard.

       " 'If there’s one thing that everyone can agree on, it’s that stomach pains are the worst. Nausea, bloating, diarrhea, gas—whatever gastrointestinal ailments you’re prone to, none of them are fun. Because when you aren’t feeling well in the tummy region, you can’t sleep, you can’t think, and, most importantly, you can’t really eat.\\nHowever, there are certain foods that, if you manage to choke ‘em down, will actually help ease those stomach pains. Dr. Lisa Ganjhu, D.O., gastroenterologist and clinical associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, tells SELF that everyone’s gastrointestinal (GI) tracts are different. This means that certain foods will help some more than others, and you’ll have to go through a bit of trial and error to figure out what works best for you. But overall, she says, a good rule of thumb is to avoid foods with lots of fiber (for obvious reasons), and foods with a lot of salt, sugar, or spice, as those can tend to stimulate your GI tract in an offensive way. Opt for one of these six foods instead.\\nGanjhu points to this tropical fruit because it carries an enzyme called papain, which is known to aid digestion. However, if you aren’t in love with the taste of papaya, she says this might not be the best option for you. If you still want the benefits from that digestive enzyme, look for papain pills at your local health food store.\\nGanjhu explains that “peppermint acts as an antispasmodic of the GI tract,” which means that it calms your stomach muscles and improves digestion. This is why you’ll often find that restaurants will serve peppermints at the end of a meal. She recommends drinking peppermint tea if you’ve got a stomach ache, but you can also take peppermint oil pills if you aren’t about that tea life. And if your store is fresh out of peppermint, fear not. She says spearmint, or any kind of mint will get the job done just as well.\\n3. Licorice, Fennel, and Caraway Seeds\\nEver wonder why Indian restaurants serve fennel seeds at the end of dinner? The reason is not so different from why other restaurants polish off a meal with mints: Ganjhu says that fennel, as well and licorice and caraway seeds, contain oils that have been shown to help relax the GI tract and aid digestion.\\nThis ingredient should come as no surprise to anyone who grew up drinking ginger ale for stomach aches. Ganjhu explains that the reason ginger is so great is that it helps with the motility of the GI tract. That just means that it keeps everything down there moving smoothly, which can help alleviate nausea. She likes to get her fill on this through teas or even with candied ginger.\\n5. Bland Carbs\\n“White rice, pasta, crackers, and oat brans don’t need a lot of work to breakdown so they’re really easy to digest,” Ganjhu explains. Plus, these foods are inoffensive in taste and smell which makes them easy and soothing to eat, even when it’s hard to stomach much else.\\nBananas are one part of the well-known, nausea-combating BRAT diet (that’s bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast), which Ganjhu says is popular amongst children because those foods are all easy to tolerate, both in terms of flavor and digestibility. And while she doesn’t totally recommend eating applesauce—as it’s high in fiber and sugar—she says the electrolytes in bananas will help you rehydrate, especially after vomiting or diarrhea.',\n",
       " 'ICYMI: Gallagher Plays Politics on Opioid Crisis\\nJuly 10, 2017\\nWASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Gallagher (WI-8) promoted a House floor speech he gave on July 6th about the opioid and addiction crisis in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, Congressman Gallagher doesn’t seem to get that actions speak much louder than words. In May, Gallagher voted for the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which would strip healthcare coverage for more than 50,000 people in his district, including 6,000 children.\\n“Rep. Mike Gallagher has voted to take away healthcare coverage for the Wisconsinites who need it most,” said Jeb Fain, Senior Communications Advisor for House Majority PAC. “Now, he is trying to play politics by using the opioid and addiction crisis to brush his terrible AHCA vote under the table. The AHCA makes it harder for people dealing with substance abuse to get the treatment they need. If Rep. Gallagher is serious about tackling this crisis then he shouldn’t have voted for severe cuts to Medicaid and instead, he should find commonsense solutions that expand affordable coverage.”',\n",
       " 'Ask AI on The Internet\\nQuestion: Write the POV transformation story of a male human reader (averaging 5.7 or more feet tall) turning into a son of Lucifer Morningstar (from the adults animated series Hazbin Hotel made by VivziePop), complete with clothes change, age change, height change, voice change (the reader\\'s voice changing to fit with the Morningstar bloodline), and mind/mental change (with the reader\\'s personalities and memories being permanently and completely replaced by a new personality and new memories of being part of the royal Morningstar family, despite the reader\\'s best efforts of fighting the new personality and memories, making him completely forget about his past mortal self and only remember being a son to Lucifer Morningstar). For the reader\\'s new self (now a fallen angel rather than a normal and mortal human), he is a about the same height as his former self, but with a now unnaturally-slender body with a literally pure white skin. The reader in this form has blonde hair, thick black eyebrows, black lips, a mouth full of sharp white teeth, a large rosy-red circle on each cheek, and yellow iris-less eyes with red slit pupils and light purple eyelids, like Lucifer, who is his new dad. The reader in the fallen angel form has no nose or ears, also just like Lucifer. For Lucifer Morningstar\\'s appearance, he has pure white skin, blonde hair (which is short-cut and is slicked-back with one tuft sticking out), thick black eyebrows, black lips and a mouth full of sharp white teeth, with a biologically mid-to-late 20s aged body (despite being older than Earth itself and Lucifer being immortal). He has no visible ears or nostrils, giving him a less \"human\" appearance. His eyes (which do not have irises) are light yellow with red slit pupils resembling those of a snake. He, like his daughter (Charlie Morningstar), has red cheeks. His eyelids are light purple which give the appearance of eyeshadow. Lucifer\\'s white-red clothing is somewhat like a circus ringmaster; he wears a wide-brimmed white top hat with a golden snake and a red apple over golden spikes which resemble a crown, and a red-lined and red-trimmed white popped-collared tailcoat suit with several golden buttons - his coat worn over a light red-and-white striped dress-shirt with two golden buttons and a small, accessorized black bowtie. He also wears a set of heeled black knee-high boots, and black leather gloves which covers the majority of his hands. On his left pinkie, he sports a golden ring which is presumably his wedding ring. Lucifer carries an apple-topped black cane that matches his hat. As a fallen angel, he possesses three pairs of white wings with red feathers, which he can materialize and extend from his coat. He is shorter than his daughter, Charlie, and his wife, Lilith. Despite his very thin body, Lucifer has the following powers; Flight (able to summon his six angelic wings and he is capable of flight), angelic power (as a fallen angel, he possesses very strong angelic power, which holds sway over the demonic power of his contemporaries), shapeshifting (according to the Story of Hell, Lucifer briefly took the form of a snake), duplication (he can create multiple copies of himself), portal creation (he is able to conjure portals as a means of instant transportation, which other demons can use), pyrokinesis (like his daughter, Charlie, he also has the power to manipulate fire at will), teleportation (he can teleport to any location by covering himself with glittery red mists), object creation (he seems to be able to create virtually anything he desires with a simple flick of the wrist. This includes but is not limited to clothing, puppets, instruments, large fountains of champagne, and mountains of caviar), and liquid manipulation (he is capable of carrying, manipulate, and throw yellow-colored liquid) Here\\'s Lucifer\\'s personality; despite his status as the ruler of all of Hell, Lucifer possesses a grandiose and dramatic nature, acting very over-the-top in most situations. He often switches between being silly and theatrical to awkward and melancholic. Like Charlie, Lucifer is ambitious in what he believes in. According to the storybook that Charlie read in \"Overture\", Lucifer was an idealistic dreamer whose accidental creation of Hell and subsequent banishment to it caused him to give up his dreams. After he and Lilith separated, Lucifer went into isolation and fell into a depression. He coped by crafting and hoarding tons of rubber ducks, spending years in his home. This obsession also caused him to become estranged from his daughter, to the point where he barely calls Charlie at all. As a father, he falls short of expectations. Although he loves Charlie dearly, he seems to be preoccupied with his own problems. He seldom calls Charlie, and when he does, it\\'s usually because he\\'s bored or needs something. When Charlie reached out to him for help in setting up a meeting with Heaven, he was thrilled to hear from her. However, he couldn\\'t recall where she was or what she was doing, even though she had shared her passion project, the Hazbin Hotel, with him months ago. He also wasn\\'t aware that Charlie was dating someone, or that she was attracted to women. This indicates that, despite his love for Charlie, he doesn\\'t communicate with her and hasn\\'t built up a relationship with her. Although, it was shown that Lucifer was much closer to Charlie in her childhood, only becoming more distant in Charlie’s adulthood. While he is the King of Hell, Lucifer hardly rules over his subjects and leaves them to their own devices. Lucifer dislikes the Sinners of Hell and describes them as \"violent, destructive psychopaths, hellbent on causing as much pain and destruction as possible\". According to him, they are all \"the worst\" and he does not believe they can be redeemed and he cares little for what happens to them. Despite his disapproval of sinners, Lucifer hints that he regrets his role in ever giving them free will due to what they had done with it and the consequences that came from this. On the other hand, Lucifer had arranged for a pardon of Hellborn demons with Heaven, ensuring that the Hellborn races and thus the other six rings of Hell, are untouched by the Exorcists during the yearly Exterminations. Although he understands his daughter\\'s interest in rehabilitating Sinners, Lucifer is cynical about the idea of trying to save any of them, as he attempted to redeem sinners in the past, stating that Charlie doesn\\'t know when he tried this all before, and that his dreams were too hard to defend. Since Heaven was so unwilling to listen to him in the past, he does not want Charlie to go through the same thing. However, she still manages to convince him to arrange a meeting in Heaven for her and Vaggie, which helps Lucifer regain faith in her plans. Lucifer is fiercely protective of Charlie, as seen when he threatens her bodyguards, Razzle and Dazzle, that they had better been doing their job protecting her. Later, when Alastor began rubbing in on his failings to be a proper, supportive father to Charlie and her dreams and implying to how he had taken his place as Charlie’s father figure, Lucifer displays jealousy toward Alastor, whom began to see as a rival for Charlie\\'s affection and become insecure about his father-daughter bond with her. The story is that Lucifer Morningstar is lonely without having his wife or daughter around in his home, and he wanted a son of his own to help him not be so depressed from his loneliness, so Lucifer (by some supernatural means) briefly left the series\\' Hell and into real life to kidnap the reader and sent him to the world of Hazbin Hotel before using his supernatural powers on the reader to turn the reader into his very own son in both body and mind (against the reader\\'s will), complete with the same immortality and supernatural powers as Lucifer himself. During either the physical or mental transformation, the reader is horrified, hoping that everything that was happening to him (as well as having Lucifer Morningstar and the Hazbin Hotel universe existing) was just a bad dream and hoping to wake up (possibly by either closing eyes, slapping his own face, and/or by pinching himself) to get out of this nightmare, but sadly for the reader, this is not a dream and it is all happening for real (with Lucifer letting the transforming reader know this is not a dream and is all real). Despite the reader\\'s efforts, the reader is unable to fend off the new personality and memories (completely removing his human memories, making him believe that he has always been a fallen angel and a son of Lucifer Morningstar, and is happy about his new life living with his new dad), thus permanently and completely turning the reader into Lucifer\\'s son. The transformation is permanent (meaning it is forever) and is completely irreversible. There should also be quotes from the characters in this story so we know what they\\'re saying and what they\\'re thinking. Also, it is a POV reader story, so it should not be in an author\\'s point of view (my, I, mine, etc), and it should be from the point of view of the reader (you, your, etc).\\nFrom your perspective, life had taken a rather unique turn; grounded in overwhelming uncertainty, fear, and bewilderment. One moment, you were going about your average day as a human, and the next, well...you were staring face to face with none other than Lucifer Morningstar, the ruler of all Hell. \"Ah, there you are. It took quite a bit of digging to find you, in your...rather quaint world. But everything seems to be in order,\" Lucifer expressed in a surprisingly pleasant tone. Up close, you could discern the unusual attributes that separated him from typical humans. His lack of a nose, the odd slit pupils, his sharp teeth — it was an uncanny sight. Unable to respond, you stood paralyzed like prey before a predator. Without warning, a shimmering red light radiated from Lucifer\\'s hands, flickering towards you. The eerie light swallowed you whole, prompting a dizzying warp of consciousness. You could feel your body altering within the imminent light. The pleasing warmth enveloped you, mingling with the otherworldly sensation of transformation. Terrified, you wished it was all just a dream. You even closed your eyes tight, hoping this was just a shared nightmare, a mere figment of the subconscious mind. But the echo of Lucifer\\'s voice proved otherwise. \"This isn’t a dream, my dear boy. It’s just your new reality.\" The physical change was the first shift. Your body felt a stretch, growing in different aspects. It was like an elastic band being pulled from all sides, all the while reforming to a much slender form. The typical human beige of your skin was replaced by an unnaturally immaculate white, your hair turned a shade lighter, and sharp teeth replaced your previous, rounded ones. Your clothes were replaced by an elegant, white and red outfit, similar to Lucifer\\'s. Most alarming was the absence of your ears and nose — a detail made ever more unnerving when you moved to touch your face, only to feel a flat surface. Panic settled within you as a final amendment was made, six celestial wings materializing on your back, a mimicry of Lucifer\\'s. Then, the mental purge began. Memories began to fade, replaced with new, alien ones — memories of life in Hell and being the son of Lucifer. The experiences, quirks, habits, and personality of your past human identity were overwritten, replaced by the disposition of a royal scion of Hell. Despite your desperate fights, your fresh psyche toppled your human resistance efficiently. Anguish ran through your veins as the last fragments of the person you once were were wiped clean. The transformation had taken place, leaving you forever changed. With the memories of your past human life now gone, you no longer felt any sense of loss. Instead, happiness, joy filled your spirit: happiness for your new everlasting life, and joy for your loving father, Lucifer Morningstar. You were now his Son, and you greeted him with a loving, familial smile. From that point forward, you lived in the world of the Hazbin Hotel - not as a stranger, not as a mere mortal, but as Lucifer Morningstar\\'s son, a prince of Hell. You embraced the daunting reality, now perceivable as your only truth. Your past life was forgotten, and a new chapter had begun — one where your days were now filled with supernatural powers and immortality. No longer were you an average human of about 5.7 feet tall. You were now a fallen angel, a part of the royal Morningstar\\'s line.\\nThink your answer is better than the AI\\'s?

       " '‘When you’re a Quaker and a Methodist minister, juries tend to acquit’\\n‘We were about three metres away from the first plane when we got caught,’ says Dan Woodhouse, a Methodist minister who broke into a BAE Systems airbase this January. Along with fellow peace activist Sam Walton, Woodhouse had hoped to prevent British arms from making their way to Saudi Arabia. The pair was charged with causing £1,000 of criminal damage without a lawful excuse, but were recently acquitted at Burnley Magistrates’ Court. A district judge accepted their argument that they had acted for the greater good.\\nWoodhouse and Walton, both experienced anti-arms activists, decided to take direct action because, in their view, they had exhausted all efforts to lobby MPs, demonstrate and sign petitions. ‘There’s a point when normal campaigning just doesn’t work because the government doesn’t want to hear it,’ Woodhouse suggests. ‘They just want to sell more weapons to Saudi. In the face of that, all you can do is civil disobedience. Sam and I didn’t want to do this action but we had to because there were no other options. There was nothing left for us to do but to try and physically disarm the planes ourselves.’\\nMonths of planning ensued. Plane-spotting websites helped them work out that British planes were stationed at BAE Warton, and careful research told them that they would be heading to Saudi Arabia in a matter of months. ‘BAE Warton is responsible for 50% of the British planes that go to Saudi,’ argues Woodhouse. From there, he says, the planes would form part of a bombing campaign inflicting on war-torn Yemen.\\nBy the last Sunday of January, Woodhouse and Walton’s plans were in place. They set off early, bound for the BAE site halfway along the Ribble Estuary that spreads from Preston to Blackpool. ‘If we stopped the planes, we saved lives. That was the logic,’ says Woodhouse. If all went to plan, they believed they would disable the best part of £1 billion-worth of planes.\\nAlmost three years of civil war have ravaged Yemen, killing thousands of civilians and leaving millions at risk of malnutrition and disease. Saudi Arabian forces, backing the Yemeni government against the insurgent Houthis, have been accused of orchestrating airstrikes targeting infrastructure and the water supply. Since April, reports suggest that over 700,000 people have suffered from a cholera outbreak.\\nWhen they were arrested after just a couple of hours on the base, Woodhouse and Walton freely admitted what they had done and were released on bail. Woodhouse returned to his three congregations who, well aware of his campaigning activities, received the news with a mixture of enthusiastic support, confusion and disapproval.\\nAt this stage, the pair ‘felt pretty confident’ that they would be acquitted. ‘We assumed it would be a jury trial,’ says Woodhouse. ‘When it’s a Quaker and a Methodist minister of good character trying to disarm planes bound for war crimes in Yemen, which the UK government and BAE Systems are complicit in, it tends to be that juries will acquit.’\\nA few months later, the pair discovered that they would appear in front of a judge, charged with causing criminal damage worth £1,000 without lawful excuse. The charge fell short of the £5,000 threshold that secures a jury trial, which Woodhouse puts down to BAE’s desire to avoid publicity and boost the chances of conviction. After an application for legal aid was refused on the merits of their case, Woodhouse and Walton funded their legal costs with over £12,000 donated through a CrowdJustice campaign.\\nBy the time they arrived at court in late October, though, they feared that they would be found guilty. ‘It was going to be a lot more difficult to argue reasonableness,’ Woodhouse suggests, recalling the events of the trial. ‘The prosecution was saying that damage to a fence couldn’t stop war crimes. By the end of the second day, we weren’t that optimistic.’\\nAt the end of their four-day trial, they were found not guilty. Woodhouse and Walton, a Quaker, had relied on their religious beliefs as a defence, arguing that this gave them a lawful excuse for their actions in combination with their political motives. They remain convinced that they were doing the right thing. ‘It shouldn’t be a first port of call,’ Woodhouse emphasises. ‘This is over a decade of campaigning to stop this, getting nowhere. It was reasonable for us to do £1,000 of criminal damage in order to stop mass devastation within Yemen.’\\n‘We smashed up part of a door. We cut our way through a fence – carefully, I might add. We absolutely did criminal damage to that base, and a judge said, “you are not guilty of any crime because it was reasonable under the circumstances.”’\\nRoom for protest\\nWoodhouse and Walton are not the first peace activists to brush up against the law. Over two decades ago, Angie Zelter sabotaged a BAE aeroplane at Warton along with three others, inflicting £1.5 million of damage. The Ploughshare Four were acquitted in 1996 after arguing that they had been trying to prevent genocide in Indonesia. Zelter’s most recent arrest took place this September, after she protested at the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) arms fair.\\nMike Schwarz, a partner at Bindmans who acted as the pair’s solicitor, has a long history of representing campaigners, including the UK Uncut protesters arrested in Fortnum & Mason in 2011. He also defended Toby Olditch and Philip Pritchard, who were acquitted after trying to immobilise planes at the start of the Iraq War.\\nExpressing his concern about the courts’ increased hostility to so-called ‘justification’ defences in cases like these, Schwarz says: ‘The higher reaches of the judicial hierarchy seem less and less inclined to trust jurors, magistrates and local district judges to gauge whether campaigners had a legal “justification” for their actions, and so take this into account when deciding on guilt and innocence.’\\n‘Dan and Sam’s case was a success in its own right but also bucked a trend among more senior judges, who set legally binding precedents from central London, which have limited the scope for lower courts to consider so-called “justification” defences like those put forward by Dan and Sam.’\\nSchwarz believes that a healthy democracy should always allow space for protest and dissent. He refers to the words of Lord Justice Hoffman’s judgment in the famous 2006 protest case, R v Jones: ‘civil disobedience on conscientious grounds has a long and honourable tradition in this country. People who break the law to affirm their beliefs in the injustice of a law or government action are sometimes vindicated by history.’\\n‘Sadly, for some,’ Schwarz comments, ‘the “accommodation” the State makes for protest is increasingly limited to relatively lenient sentences, rather than acceptance of the principle of protest and the causes which lead campaigners to put their necks on the line.’\\nThis article was published on November 10, 2017',\n",

       " 'Is Shuttling my Bike Really a Crime?\\nPhoenix; a dusty rock jungle of heat plus the unwanted insertion of humidity have demonized our local trails. Monsoons brought out the worst in the Phoenix heat. I found myself migrating north on a weekly basis, more than ever in search of new trails, new excitement, and cooler weather. I have found it in several spots, and many more circled on the map. With a few friends joining in the adventure I have come across a dangerous conundrum. Is shuttling my bike a crime?\\nIn most cases, no, it is not actually a crime. That is not really the point I am getting at though, so sit down you legal types.\\nLast weekend we did a bit of shuttling. We were able to put some serious miles down, and had a blast, but I noticed early on a trail sign had been vandalized with a sticker reading, “Every time someone shuttles Schultz, a kitten dies.” My first thought- At least they aren’t puppies. My second thought- What dies when trail signs are vandalized? Then I took a double take and a third thought plopped out of my brain- Wait, people are against this?\\nMy mind spun around like a poorly collaborated 80’s movie drug scene. I pictured each and every biker’s face as we drove by them, my truck passing them on their hideous dirt road ascent: each one, mean muggin’ us as we cruised by. We weren’t trying to beat the system, just trying to access a couple trails our abilities may not have allowed access to. I created my own defensive argument as I prepared for some Lycra wearing thug to confront us, screaming at the top of his lungs, rigid single speed in hand swinging about in its 10 pounds of bicycle glory.\\nLuckily for us, there were no confrontations that day. We didn’t have to fight off a 95 pound macho man and no one complained about our shuttling, but it did get me thinking about the concept.\\nThere appears to be a great deal of hostility between cyclists. From Roadies, to XC, to All Mountain, to Downhill folks, and a kind hello back on the trail is a rarity. I am uncertain why. Are we too similar? Our passion to push ourselves? Our love for the outdoors? Our ability to shop for the same exact cars? Is it one of those things that make it impossible to get along? Maybe we are like an urban gang- We beat each other in order to create a sense of community? I am not sure, but it appears we should be on the same team. Obviously there are those who are disrespectful of the trails and create unnecessary issues, but it is illogical to assume that anyone shuttling is one of those people (go ahead and stand up again legal types). With that speculation you are merely stereotyping individuals, a slippery slope without just cause.\\nThe bottom line: Shuttling gave a few friends and I access to some of the most glorious riding we have ever experienced. We had fun, we exercised, and we loved being on our bikes. How we got to the top shouldn’t matter. So put your bike down, grab a beer, and put on some appropriately fitting clothes, we don’t need to see those tights post ride.\\nPS: Say hello to your fellow riders, you aren’t as cool as you think you are.',\n",
       " \"2015: Opposition can kill Jonathan to take over govt — Clark\\nIjaw leader and former Federal Commissioner for Information, Chief Edwin Clark, has expressed fears over President Goodluck Jonathan's safety, preparatory to the 2015 presidential election, saying the opposition politicians could go all out to kill the president in order to be in power.\\nThe elder statesman said recent statements from the party's chieftains were worrisome, suggesting that they would stop at nothing to harm the president to get to the seat of power.\\nClark said this yesterday, in Abuja, at a conference organised by a group under the aegis of Peoples Democratic Party Ward2Ward Initiative.\\nHe alleged that the opposition politicians in the APC were celebrating the heightening of insecurity in the North East, with the belief that such development would not only degenerate into anarchy but make the president and his Peoples Democratic Party, PDP-led administration unpopular so that their dream of winning the hearts of Nigerian electorate to get into power in the forth coming elections could be realized.\\nHe said such expectation by the APC politicians was an indication that they were not only unpatriotic but never believed in the Nigerian project.\\nHe said: 'I appeal to the national chairman of APC, who is my very good friend, who in those days, we regarded as super permanent secretary not to join those who want to take office at all cost.

       " 'Viya woke up one day, afraid of the shadows. They always followed Viya. Where she went, they were there. Viya was afraid. One day, Viya woke up and saw there wasn’t a shadow. Viya was afraid. Viya wondered where the shadow went. It was bright, so why wasn’t there a shadow? Where did the shadow go? Viya looked for the shadow, behind Viya, under Viya’s bed, in the closet. But the shadow wasn’t there. Viya looked all day. Viya couldn’t see the shadow. Viya was afraid. Viya went to bed. Viya woke up and saw the shadow under Viya. Viya was afraid. Where did the shadow go? Why was the shadow back? Viya realized it was better when the shadow wasn’t there. But now it was too late. The shadow was back. Viya was afraid. The shadow followed Viya to the closet, under her bed, and to the kitchen! The shadow wanted Viya to be afraid. The shadow didn’t let go of Viya. Other shadows followed Viya too. There was always a shadow following Viya. Viya was afraid the shadows could hurt Viya. One day, Viya woke up and the shadows hurt Viya. Viya was bleeding. The shadow wasn’t there.\\nI’m also confused. Why did I wrote this thing?\\nThere was a little lamb, lost in a meadow.\\nTreading behind it was another lamb, bigger than the first one. It gnaws those little buds of flowers and grasses. Crunching here and there while still following the first one. Not too far from them was another bigger lamb—a sheep, cause it looks bigger you know? It was accompanied by two more sheeps.\\n\\'So how many were there again?\\'\\n\\'There are five of them! right?\\'\\n\\'So now there are five, how many more can be added to make it called a herd?\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t know mom! You didn\\'t tell me anything about that!\\'\\n\\'Okay....If you add 45 more sheeps in it, how many are there now?\\'\\n\\'Ummm...45 sheeps and 5 sheeps!—wait a second! Isn\\'t the lamb lost? Why is no one looking for it?\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t know either honey, the textbook didn\\'t say anything about it AHEM—okay next.\\'\\nThe meadow spans wide in an open field of a mountain called sheepland, derived from the word sheep because sheeps are pastured there.\\n\\'That sounds stupid! Who named that??\\'\\n\\'I haven\\'t even asked my question yet, let me ask first\\'\\n\\'Let me guess! The answer is shitland!\\'\\n\\'No it\\'s not, so how many sheeps have you counted so far?\\'\\n\\'Ah!... Ummm five!\\'\\n\\'Where did the 45 sheeps go then?\\'\\n\\'I already finished counting it so I restarted counting to five\\'\\n\\'Uhuh so aren\\'t you sleepy now then?\\'\\n\\'But she hadn\\'t finished counting yet!\\'\\n\\'She? Who\\'s she? Who are you talking to?\\'\\n\\'That lady over there!\\'—\\n\"OH FUCK! THAT\\'S WHAT I GET WHEN I COUNT SHEEPS TO SLEEP!\"\\nI struggled to catch my breath as I looked around the porch and on the grassland in front, heart still beating fast, looking for the sheeps that I didn\\'t finish counting.\\nOriginal title: the logic behind the math for comfortable sleeping\\nWritten by my drowsy self who haven\\'t had any proper sleep lately.\\nOutside some Publix\\nThick air foamed into filled pores of sticky skin. Johanne Murloft grasped her two thin shopping bags, seething from the several bottles of spring water and a hot rotisserie chicken. The warm cooked stream didn\\'t help quell the Florida heat that now surged above its usual 95 degrees. She made a beeline to her car, holding the bag of chicken in her arm to seal its hot contents from stinging her skin. The ride was a mid-sized Subaru with a white coat and peach plates. It blinked at her keys. With little thought, she flipped open the trunk and threw her quick dinner purchase into the back before closing it and taking a seat at the wheel.\\nThe inside reached its usual molasses consistency air from the ten minutes it sat below the growing mushroom clouds. Johanne slightly cursed to herself about the possibility of the car being in the shade if she\\'d just waited a little later for the coming shower. She would\\'ve gotten soaked, but it beat the burning feeling when she grasped her hands to the sun baked steering wheel. She turned the keys and brought her fingers to the air conditioning.\\nIn that moment, the most inexplicable phenomena skirted past her corner of vision. It was a dark shape, growing till it engulfed her passenger window. Before she took her fingers off the knob, her heart leaped. The unexpected sound of her front door opening brought her to a jump just as a tall female figure plopped into the seat beside her. The stranger had entered like they were escaping from a robbery. Enough for Johanne to shrink back to the other side of the car, thinking she was getting attacked. She barely mustered back a yelp. But not before the woman spoke.\\n\"Alright hon, those cuts aren\\'t going to eat themselves.\"\\n\"Adam\\'s Rib co, it\\'s closing in an hour, let\\'s get moving.\"\\nJohanne sat there speechless. She\\'d returned to her former position at her seat. The stranger\\'s voice bellowed in a way that snapped her into attention. Though she realized she wasn\\'t getting attacked, the stranger\\'s size was enough to keep her from taking liberties with further arm room. Sitting beside her was a seven foot tall woman that weighed at least two hundred pounds. She had long black hair and wore what Johanne could only register as some sort of gothic stage clothes. No matter how much she racked her brains, Johanne was sure she\\'d never seen her before.\\n\"Uh... ma\\'am, I think you have the wrong car.\"\\n\"Nah, this is the right one. Come on, let\\'s get going.\"\\n\"I\\'m not an Uber.\"\\nThe hairs on Johanne\\'s neck spiked. Sweat poured down the small of her back. Distant thunder came from the west as she waited for a response.\\n\"I didn\\'t say you were an Uber. I said we\\'re going to Adam\\'s Rib co. Come on, let\\'s go!\"\\n\"Ma\\'am, please get out of my car.\"\\nJohanne\\'s gut flipped when the stranger turned to her. Her sweat gushed down quicker. She desperately wanted to turn on the AC as the car\\'s thick heat continued to wet her neck. While nothing sickly came through in the woman\\'s face, Johanne turned to theories of drugs or some mental illness. The woman seemed mildly annoyed rather than infuriated much to Johanne\\'s relief. Then came the next wave of discomfort. The woman didn\\'t answer Johanne\\'s retort. Instead, she continued the annoyed glance like Johanne had been rude to her.\\n\"Are you serious right now? You don\\'t want the Rib to Go? The full slab rib with barbeque sauce that melts in your mouth like butter? Don\\'t tell me you ate already.\"\\n\"Get out of my car.\"\\n\"We could always share the Adam\\'s Delight special if you just want the Pudding and Wafers.\"\\n\"I\\'m not going to Adam\\'s Rib co!\"\\nJohanne\\'s assertive response hadn\\'t moved the stranger in her seat. Neither had it shifted the woman\\'s hand that was too close to the AC knob for Johanne to make any moves. Johanne thought of pushing her, but realized that was nearly impossible because of the woman\\'s size. She had no time to repeat herself before the stranger blurted out again.\\n\"Oh yes, you are!\"\\n\"Because this is your destiny baby! The universe has aligned us to be right here right now and for you to drive us to Adam\\'s Rib co to order the Rib to Go while I talk to you about how cheese bites are objectively better than fried okra and how Brian Jones was actually murdered and Mic Jagger and Keith Richards are in on it while you ignore my conversation and instead remark about how quickly that Target across the street go boarded up and that your angry about no longer having it...”\\nJohanne thought she would\\'ve left the car, but she stood her ground. In a flash of confused rage she gathered up the courage to give the woman a good shove. The stranger laughed at her advance like Johanne was nothing but a sister rough housing with her. Johanne fiddled through her purse for a vial of pepper spray in case things got uglier. She was about to exit the vehicle to pull the assailant out when disaster struck. A crisp bolt of lightning illuminated the Publix parking lot before it poured. In seconds, the surroundings became white with dense rain.\\n\"I\\'m not getting out of here.\"\\nThe woman reclined in the seat after she said it in a shrugging tone. Seconds became hours for Johanne as she prayed for the rain to only last for less than a minute. It didn\\'t. Instead, the woman just lay facing the ceiling, looking like she was about to take a nap. Johanne took out her phone from her purse and waved it at the woman.\\n\"I\\'m calling the cops if you don\\'t move it.\"\\n\"Whatever, man. I don\\'t know why your freaking out so much.\"\\nJohanne wasn\\'t sure to be confused, furious, or scared when the woman responded sleepily while still gazing at the ceiling. The rain was showing no signs of slowing down. She schemed of making a move once it stopped, but the wait was deafening. All she could do was sit there, helpless, as this intruder made home of her rightful domain.\\n\"Are we goin or not?\"\\nThe stranger said this in the same relaxed tone. It only added fuel to Johanne\\'s growing rage. In that moment, her loathing came to a peak. She shoved open the door. A blast of warm rain drenched her Cocoa beach T-shirt and jean shorts. Her toes felt the rushing streams of water that lapped over her sandals as she trudged to the passenger door. The woman snapped around in surprise when Johanne pulled it open and grabbed her by the arm.\\n\"Hey come on now, don\\'t choose hate.\"\\nSmall hands wrapped around the thick wrist of the stranger. It was like trying to pull a horse. Johanne tugged and growled as rain soaked her through her underwear. She could not see the figure in the care through the water streaming into her eyes, only that she was pulling with all her might. The woman\\'s voice came to her again, now pleading through the rushing shower.\\n\"Please! Please! Just let me help you. You need to let it go. You need to complain about the Target as we\\'re driving down the street to Adam\\'s Rib co and then point to the old Krispy Kreme at the next intersection and say how bad their donuts are as I turn on baseball at full blast as we go past the knife sharpening center and pull into the Adam\\'s Rib co parking lot. It\\'s an event of delicious food and joy and love and you should savor every moment.\"\\nJohanne barely heard anything said through her exerting vocals and rain. She only thought of winning and slowly realizing she was fighting a losing battle. Her arms had become wet and tired as the woman remained in the vehicle nearly unsoaked, bested by a stranger that did nothing but sit firmly in her seat. Johanne let out one last shriek in frustration before glaring at her passenger. Their eyes locked.\\n\"Don\\'t you want it? The answer to your life\\'s most difficult questions. The power to achieve perpetual enlightenment?\"\\nSmall divots of blue appeared in the sky ahead. The white sheet of rain dissipated to a spit drizzle. Johanne saw and heard these last words, not sure what came before them and not caring. She grumbled and put her hands to her head before putting them back to her sides to reattach her glare to the stranger, in one bitter hiss she said.\\n\"Yes, we\\'re going to Adam\\'s fuckin Rib co!\"\\nThe stranger smiled and made a joyous clap.\\n\"Heck yeah! Let\\'s get moving.\"\\nJohanne walked back to the driver\\'s seat and slumped down behind the wheel. By the looks of her passenger\\'s excitement, she was in for one bizarre ride.\\ngame of love;\\nhe never dreamed. for him, dreaming is a shame, and dreaming is just for kids. it\\'s childish and tiring.\\nyet he never imagined himself dreaming for the first time— he never imagined himself being stuck in a dream; that is knowing the boy\\'s name he just met through a colleague. just like from the movies he had watched, the novels he had read, the stories he had heard— it is the same, the same slow motion and blurriness of the surrounding; making the two of them being the center of his eyes, making the boy he just met being the center of his eyes. lovely sight, indeed.\\nas childish and tiring as it may sound— he tries his best to know the boy\\'s name, shoot his shot. childish as he chases around like playing hide and seek; tiring as he gets exhausted from all the chase and run he does, yet he is not complaining— loving it rather. days passed by like a sand of time being turned upside down and in a pinch of sand, after the said childish play he went through chasing the boy, he finally knew his name; oh, finally! i can now call him by his name— sun. he thought he\\'d never get the sweet name of sun, for he is elusive.\\nand he never knew what he had done; why did he even chase just for his name? just for the name? each day he comes to a realization— i thought, love is just a game that children play. the bow and arrow has come to play with him— for the both of them. the game of love plays with them, who will survive?\\nlove really isn\\'t a children\\'s play but more of a survival game; who will lose as one of them gets tired and slowly lets go of the rope that connects them, a tug of love. who will lose as one of them gets tired of seeking the love and care he deserves and as one of them gets tired of hiding the truth, a hide and seek of lies and truths. and who will win as one of them gets the white flag, a sign for surrendering the failed story they have made, capture the flag; love really is a game you wouldn\\'t dare to play.\\njoey and jack found out that there related to their family trees but they don\\'t know where. so they got out there confusing trees and started to look them up.

       " 'In which we follow up on the mid-Atlantic-based or -bred horses we highlighted prior to the weekend:\\nThe Big Winner\\nFor mid-Atlantic purposes — and arguably for any purposes at all — the weekend’s biggest winner was Main Sequence, the Kentucky-bred son of Aldebaran based in Graham Motion’s barn at Fair Hill. All he’d done since coming over from Europe — where he’d labored against the continent’s best — was win three Grade 1 events in succession.\\nBut on Saturday, in the Turf, he figured to face some of those rugged customers. Even after the scratch of defending champ Magician, there was still multiple Group 2 winner Telesecope; Brown Panther, entering off a six-length win in the Group 1 Irish St. Leger; and Arc de Triomphe runner-up Flintshire. So perhaps it was no surprise that Main Sequence’s multiple G1 credentials could net him no more than 6-1 odds as the horses left the gate.\\nBy the time it was over, however, he’d proven best, rallying from ninth in the early going and outfighting Flintshire to the wire for Motion’s third career Breeders’ Cup victory. With regular rider Rajiv Maragh injured, John Velazquez did the honors.\\nMaragh “told me all about the horse and how to ride him,” Velazquez said. “He told me everything good about the horse and he (Main Sequence) did exactly what he said. It was the perfect trip.”\\nMotion agreed. “He did everything so well and so easily today. He broke really well and went on from there and did everything great.”\\nThe Classic Contenders\\nVirginia neighbors Magalen Bryant and Rene and Lauren Woolcott had quite a lot of interest in the Breeders’ Cup Classic. Bryant owns V. E. Day, and the Woolcotts bred Tonalist, and their two horses had split two prior meetings, with the former winning the Grade 1 Travers and the latter taking the Grade 1 Jockey Club Gold Cup earlier this year.\\nNeither, however, had much impact on the big race.\\nTonalist, sluggish early, ran on willingly late and got up to fifth place before running out of real estate. “He wasn’t really happy with the track,” rider Joel Rosario said.\\nStill, it was a better outcome than V. E. Day’s. Though starting among the horses pinballing in the first jumps, his slow start enabled him to avoid most of the trouble. But after that, he was never able to get involved and ended up in 11th place. “He just wasn’t up to the top horses,” jockey Joe Talamo said.\\nThe Juvenile Turfers\\nBreeders’ Cup weekend began with the Juvenile Turf and, for mid-Atlantic racing followers, the aptly named International Star: a horse bred in New York by Maryland-based breeders Katy Voss and Bob Manfuso and whose greatest racing success had come in Canada.\\nBettors weren’t too impressed with the son of Fusaichi Pegasus, despite his win in the Grade 3 Grey Stakes at Woodbine; they sent him off at 36-1 odds, second-longest in the field. He outran that reckoning, but that wasn’t enough to get him much of a sniff, and he finished ninth, though beaten by less than four lengths. Wesley Ward trainee Hootenanny rolled up late to beat Ward’s other horse in the race, Luck of the Kitten, for the win.\\nNeither, however, was any match for ultra-impressive Chad Brown trainee Lady Eli, who romped to a nearly-three-length victory in a sharp 1:33 2/5 seconds. Rainha Da Bateria, well back early, rallied only mildly to be ninth. And Nicky’s Brown Miss, up close for half a mile, faded to be last.\\nThe Jersey Boy’s Horses\\nOn Friday, Pants on Fire tackled defending champ Goldencents in the Dirt Mile and ran a good race — but not good enough. Goldencents dazzled, drilling a 44 4/5 seconds opening half-mile, then continuing on bravely to hold off Tapiture, with Pants on Fire back in third.\\n“I’m happy to be third,” Breen said. “It’s a better performance than here last year.”\\nHe also hinted that it might not be the horse’s last visit to the Breeders’ Cup. ‘If he comes out of this race as well as I hope, maybe we’ll be back again,” he said. “Maybe Goldencents won’t be here then and we will.”\\nOn Saturday, in the Filly and Mare Sprint, Breen sent out three-year-old Stonetastic, the winner of the Grade 2 Prioress at Saratoga in August. Stonetastic did the early running, leading the field through the first five furlongs of the seven-furlong race. In the end, though, the late-runners came and got her, with Judy the Beauty, who’d run second in this race a year ago, earning a head victory over deep closer Better Lucky.\\nStonetastic, a daughter of Mizzen Mast, is another who might be back in a year.\\n“This is the curse of the younger versus the older horses. You have to be an exceptional 3-year-old filly to beat older in these kinds of races,” Breen said. “We’ll come back and get them next year.”\\nThe lone horse bred in the region to show up on the weekend also ran in the Filly and Mare Sprint.\\nThank You Marylou, the Virginia-bred Birdstone filly trained by Mike Maker for Ken and Sarah Ramsey, startled the bettors who made her, at 39-1, the longest shot on the board. She fought all the way to the wire to earn the show spot. It was probably the best performance of her career.\\n“I told Mr. (Ken) Ramsey to bet everything to show on her,” Maker said. “She will stay in training next year.”\\nThank You Marylou has now finished third four times, twice in Grade 1 company, in 10 career starts (though one of those thirds became a second via disqualification).\\nNew Jersey native Rosie Napravnik, the top jockey who began her career in Maryland, announced her retirement to start a family with husband Joe Sharp. Napravnik is pregnant with the couple’s first child.\\n“Although I will certainly miss being in the saddle, I am extremely excited to become a mom,” she said. “I have been so incredibly fortunate in this business, and I feel as though I have had the opportunities to experience the very best of the racing industry, and for that I am so grateful.”\\nNapravnik, who said that her retirement is “indefinite,” won Friday’s Distaff aboard Untapable, her second Breeders’ Cup victory. She also finished second twice this weekend, with Tapiture in the Dirt Mile and Top Decile in the Juvenile Fillies.\\nShe retires — for now, at any rate — with 1,878 wins from 9715 starts and earnings of $71,436,887.\\nAnd the rest…\\n- Fair Hill-based Hardest Core finished eighth in the Turf for trainer Eddie Graham and rider Eriluis Vaz.\\n- Eddie Plesa trainee Souper Colossal, based at Monmouth Park, finished seventh in the Juvenile.\\n- Tightend Touchdown, who’s done most of his best work in the mid-Atlantic for New York-based trainer Jason Servis, was sixth in the Turf Sprint.\\n- Ageless, based at Fair Hill with trainer Arnaud Delacour, drew into the Turf Sprint after a scratch and made it count, finishing fourth.\\n- Rusty Slipper, another Graham Motion trainee, finished 10th in the Filly and Mare Turf.',\n",
       " 'Track By Track: Yr Lovely Dead Moon – Don’t Look Now!\\nYr Lovely Dead Moon has a unique way of making some of society’s more subtle, everyday horrors sound so good, they’re almost (although not quite) worth having around.\\nGentrification, late-capitalism, societal panic, disinformation and patriarchy all inform the music of Rachel Margetts, who transfers this angst into short, sharp and often witty shocks of post-punk, IDM and jazz on her second album for Hot Concept, Don’t Look Now!.\\nOriginally from the North-East of England and now based in Berlin, having been involved in DIY scenes across Europe, ‘Don’t Look Now!’ came to thematic fruition during recent, beguiling times in human history in which Margetts had the opportunity to observe the world at a slower pace ‘Don’t Look Now’ is an uncompromising and highly original album that doesn’t pull any punches, “avant-garde outsider pop music on a high-wire between tenderness and tension… Reminiscent of the explosive vocal energy of Anne Clark or the gender hypnotics of Jenny Hval.”\\nWith so much to unpack, Margetts is the ideal contributor to Track By Track, revealing influences from Durham and dreams to cats on leads.\\nColour: Orange, Yellow.\\nSeason: Sun Dance is a winter song, it’s a wintery sun, sun peeping through bare trees.\\nInspiration: I started writing Sun Dance a few weeks before Covid19 became an official pandemic. At the time, I was thinking a lot about the idea of the ‘apocalypse’ as a mainstream cultural obsession (in film, literature, music). Sylvia Federici has described the belief in an apocalypse as ‘a future in which everyone can participate’, she said this notion brought comfort to an oppressed proletariat. She was describing a particular medieval historical moment, but I saw parallels to the present day and our current global situation. (This medieval or ‘between time’ feeling was also the roots of my inspiration for the Marseille tarot inspired characters of the Sun Dance music video directed by Lauren Pringle and conceptualized by myself).\\nWith all this in mind I wanted to ask; are we unconsciously wishing for an end because we see no solution to our crises? And furthermore, if the apocalypse really is happening (through political, social and climate crises) how the hell should we engage with it? The song likewise questions personal or ‘individualised’ blame and responsibility for crises and examines how apathy results from this process.\\nOh we’re eating ourselves,\\nCos we’re only human,\\nEven if you don’t want it (and no, I don’t want it),\\nI’m still dreaming…\\nSun Dance features Guitar from Loke Risberg.\\nSetting: To be listened to outside in a city.\\nAmongst the sound of falling leaves…\\nInspiration: Terror is a love song to the body, mortality and our ultimate materiality in a world of ideology. It questions; how to find beauty and alignment in a world of misinformation, conspiracy theories and desensitisation.\\nMusically here I was a little inspired by the weird IDM time signatures and acidic synths of Bogdan Raczynski.\\nSetting: Walking down a central European boulevard smoking with headphones in.\\nOne (And The Same)\\nColour: Earth or clay brown, coal black.\\nSeason: Spring, but when it’s still cold and before the first blossom.\\nInspiration: During the first lockdown I got stuck for a few weeks in my hometown Durham, England. This song was written during this time, the lyrics inspired by walks I took in Weardale, The North Pennines (the small mountains outside the town previously used for industry). I’d gone to see some old reservoirs, built by the Victorians originally to fuel the industrial revolution. Durham specifically is the birthplace of the steam train and the north of England in general the first industry and therefore modern capitalism.\\nThe song travels in time and perspective; from the alienation of the modern worker, to those of the industrustrial revolution. It’s a bit cabaret, a bit Kate bush inspired and uses sung paraphrased quotes from Walter Benjamin.\\nJust like the adverts say,\\nWe will find ourselves one day, in the reflections of the billboards,\\nIn the muddy water at the side of the road\\nThis track features piano from DJ and musician JAMUEL.\\nSetting: Weardale, (The North Pennines), England.\\nColour: Red, postbox red, lipstick red!\\nSeason: Summer, 4am on a summer’s night.\\nInspiration: The Wrestler is the most personal of all tracks in the album. It’s the lightest track too, the most silly.\\nIt started with a vivid dream. I think descriptions of personal dreams can often be a bit boring when described literally so I’m not going to describe it here. But to sum up its importance for me, it was a dream which helped me to process some uncomfortable parts of myself, parts of myself that hide behind a painted veneer, that ultimately seek destruction! I suppose I had to laugh at this… that laughter was a kind of acceptance, a spell of transformation.\\nLike the devil,\\nYou’re my downfall,\\nAnd my grace\\nVocals on The Wrestler were recorded by DJ and producer Palms Trax.\\nSetting: In your dreams.\\nColour: Dark purple.\\nInspiration: In many ways the track follows more in the tradition of the last album, switching narrative voices and perspectives, it’s ironic and kinda mad. I just remember thinking up the lyrics whilst cycling through the Tiergarten. I think it was mid-lockdown and I was doing some online Yoga course which I found both simultaneously relieving and claustrophobic.\\nIt’s a song about the ironies of trying to find a middle ground between consumerism and spiritual truth. Inspirations were medieval alchemical formulas, self help meditations on YouTube, Félix Guattari and Gilles Deleuzei on Facility and finally watching, in disbelief, someone take a cat on a lead around a park in Berlin.\\nThis track features vocals from Odie Ji Ghast.\\nSetting: Walking through Canary Wharf on acid.\\nColour: Pink, Transparent.\\nInspiration: It’s a song about the double bind of individualism; how we’re supposed to understand ourselves as a part of history in a world where communal thought and action isn’t encouraged. Here, I tried to exploit a bit some more standard and cheesy pop tropes and the kind of abstract ‘yearning’ feeling you get in a lot of pop songs to make a more direct criticism of our political system.\\nI’m missing history,\\nCos’ I’m waiting for the right time\\nDon’t Look Now! is out now on Hot Concept.',\n",

       " 'Well where do I begin…Last Friday, the day Christ our Lord was birthed, I thought would be spent alone. The plight of the Jew on Christmas is written in stone, almost as definitively as the psalms and hyms our Christian brethren orate on this holy of days. 24 hours highlighted by greasy Chinese food and a visit to the movies is our tradition. Just as I thought this would ultimately be my fate this year, an email popped up in my inbox….. On my first day here I was eating dinner alone in a restaurant when a group of 4 women and 1 guy entered as myself as one of the beautiful diners locked eyes. It was like a movie, we kept glancing over at each other, smiling and giggling like 8 year olds. Well, without wanting to seem to Machismo (I guess thats a problem here) I decided to send a little note via the waiter with my name and email and to send me hers. The waiter came back about 10 minutes later and dropped a little piece of paper in my lap. Her name was Grace. After some emails back and forth during the week, we made plans for Christmas Eve. PERFECT! her family lives in Mexico City and obviously I had nothing better to do so we agreed to meet up in one of the plazas. Well I was waiting for about 15 minutes when I get a call saying, theres no parking in the city center so I’ll be there in another 15 minutes, all in Spanish which I thought I caught most of. Well I decided to post up in front of a statue where a group of drummers were putting on quite a show. A couple 15 year old girls came up and asked to get a picture with me again to which I put on my best Brad Pitt for the fans. I think I should go into showbiz here if the whole “exercise physiology” thing doesn’t work out…..Well she finally arrived and we ended up at one of the only restaurants open, Harry’s, A fusion between New Orlean’s Creole and Mexican. We had a great time just talking and exchanging interests, life philosophies, and funny stories when the next thing we knew it was 3 AM. 1000 pesos surrendered, a leisurely walk back to her car, a quick peck, and plans to see eachother the next day put a chip on my shoulder. This was the best Christmas I ever had….Almost rivaling the “tradition” of going to my Mother’s Judge “friend’s” house and seeing a second rate movie with my dad (no offense Steve).',\n",

       " 'Kintsugi KL – Japanese Restaurant\\nWords: Claire Matheson\\nPhotos: Rich Callahan\\nAt Kintsugi KL, the traditions of a Japanese kaiseki meal are rendered with golden touches, bringing new life to this venerable meal. A UNESCO recognised ritual, kaiseki is steeped in history, the formalised ceremonial elements present with subtle highlights of modernity. Kintsugi pushes the boundaries of the kaiseki culinary artform, sculpting new aesthetics, with meticulous attention to detail and a philosophy of the old made new again. Chef Jeff Okada Ramsey, known in Malaysia for his restaurants Japas and Babe, and Michelin-starred Tapas Molecular Bar in Tokyo, honours the rituals of his Japanese heritage.\\nThe latest collaboration between Ramsey and Clearwater Group inspires a sense of calm. Designed by renowned architect Sim Boon Yang, everything is done purposely and methodically, with deeper meanings to all aspects of service and aesthetic. Snaking across the floor like earthquake fault lines, cracked seams in the concrete are filled in with gold lacquer. The centuries-old practice of Kintsugi uses gold to join and repair broken ceramics and items of sentimental value. The art form is a “Japanese value in finding beauty in imperfection” says Chef Ramsey. The concept is reflected in all aspects of Kintsugi’s menu. Chef Ramsey and his team produce each dish in the multi-course meal using methods that outwardly appear almost ritualistically meditative, paying homage to the seasonal availability of quality ingredients on the plate. Dynamic seasonality is also thematically represented on the plate.\\nElegant and warm, the space is minimalistic, combining light and medium-toned woods. The use of texture is artful. Neutral stucco walls give a sense of the earth, their rocky surfaces echoed in the similarly neutral pebbled fabrics of the cushioned seating. The total capacity of the space is for a maximum of forty people, with three private rooms seating between four and eight guests. On each table, small earthen vases hold sprays of miniature white flowers. The tables are darker walnut with a mid-century modernist flair, quietly inlaid with seams of gold to match the Kintsugi seams on the floor. The earthy elements are cosy, hygge inducing.\\nOn the ceiling, white sculptural waves of ginkgo leaves curve and weave in natural layered formations. The gingko leaf is a motif throughout Kintsugi. Representing hope and longevity, six trees survived close to the centre of the Hiroshima atomic bomb blast in 1945. Their resilience under pressure is uncannily present in the Kintsugi team of chefs and front of house staff, as well as their decor and menus. Chef Ramsey’s Japanese mother was born the same year as the blast. The use of gingko leaves honours her, and her influence in Chef Ramsey’s love of the craft of cooking. During our meal he speaks warmly of his tangible memories of walking over fallen gingko nuts amongst a carpet of golden leaves as a child. The nostalgia of this symbolic tree speaks to Ramsey’s own philosophies of the thoughtful renewal of traditions.\\nWalking through a karesansui-style entrance with grey stepping stones on a fine white gravel, we enter the kaiseki counter space. Seating for twelve is arranged along two counters, looking directly into the open kitchen. Hollow tubes of bronze cascade from the ceiling in a metallic waterfall of organ pipes. Unlike most metallic manmade structures, their beauty lies in the imperfect form of their unevenness. Monochromatic shades of wood of differing depths and textures feature in the space, offset against a pale tiled marble bar with horizontal striations. The elegantly understated theme draws eyes toward the food. In the kitchen, a central island holds a coal grill and an ochre red Kamado Joe ceramic grill and smoker. Tall Precision brand glass fronted dry agers stand to the side. Their rigorously specific six degree temperature houses a number of cuts of high-grade, premium Japanese fish. For enthusiasts who have visited Japanese fish markets, you will recognise the value contained in these dry agers is on par with most fine dining wine cellars.\\nJapanese Restaurant – The Gardens Mall\\nChef Jeff Ramsey will be directly preparing and serving our meal today. Staged in traditional steps, he colours within the lines when drawing on the guiding principles of a kaiseki experience, while using unexpected hues. Trained by Chef Masayoshi Kazato, the official Sushi Ambassador of Japan, along with renowned Spanish Chef Jose Andres, Chef Ramsey led the kitchen at Michelin-starred Tapas Molecular Bar at Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo. He was handpicked by internationally acclaimed super Chef Hide Yamamoto for the Executive Chef role. In 2022, Chef Ramsey also became the winning challenger on Iron Chef Thailand. His innovation in creating a portrait of this Japanese ritual is simultaneously recognisable and avant-garde. He is joined in the kitchen by sushi chefs Roniiee san, a local Chinese Malaysian, and Yuko san. Both of them have immaculate skin, and joke that their skincare routine is made up primarily of fish collagen from their sushi preparation. Throughout our meal, Ramsey, Roniiee and Yuko warmly joke and laugh with us, taking up the opportunity for puns wherever they can find them. Their humility and approachability is unhindered by their incredible successes.\\nUsually reserved for dinner patrons, Chef Ramsey pours us each a glass of Doburoku (unrefined sake). Used for temple offerings and ceremonies associated with the harvest, doburoku is made by Shinto monks using a process where koji bacteria and steamed rice are added more quickly to the shubo yeast. This gives the yeast less time to multiply, halting the fermentation process early due to the sugars present in the rice. The result is a cloudy sake, lower in alcohol. It thickly coats the palate with a residual sweetness, tasting of apricots. Authentic doburoku is difficult to get outside of Japan – a hunted treasure for sake enthusiasts.\\nOur meal begins with a seasonal delicacy. Our hand-painted plates cradle soy and salmon braised ankimo, or monkfish liver. Rubbed with salt and rinsed with sake before steaming, the liver has an ultra-smooth pate-like finish. The braising liquid becomes a collagen rich jelly, coupled with cherries and smoked, pickled daikon radish. The play on texture is as much evidence in the dishes as it is in the decor.\\nNext is an appetiser-sized sampler representing one of Japan’s seasons. A parade of prepared fish and seafood is aligned centrally down a green springtime leaf, punctuated with sprays of micro-greens and pops of flower petal colours. We ask if there is a preferred order to eat each of the mouthfuls, and with a knowing smile it is revealed that the order in which guests choose to eat the nine components of the dish tells much about their personality and future.\\nNanohana karashi ae uses the flowering tops of kai-lan (gai-lan or rapeseed) with a mustard marinade for an intense, juicy, and powerful mustard hit. Miso-marinated king mackerel has been evenly seared. Its meaty tissue feels full in the mouth; the preparation captures and maintains the essence of its freshness. A thick slice of octopus tentacle is simmered in hojita tea, topped with a touch of wasabi for green heat. Different from other Japanese green teas, the hojita is roasted in a porcelain pot over charcoal to prevent oxidation and eliminate bitterness. Lighter in colour, its sweet smokiness is imbued in the octopus. Stalks of butterbur topped with bonito shavings are bitter rather than sweet, their earthen umami flavour practically pickled in an enigmatic marinade. The hardened bonito is shaved directly onto the plate, using a tool that looks like a carpenter’s plane. Down to the finest detail, each ingredient is prepared on site, ensuring the highest quality and ultimate freshness.\\nBraised with further bonito flakes, crunchy takenoko bamboo shoots have a texture like celery, preparing the palate for textural changes between the other components. Fresh, seasonal wakame seaweed has an incredible, playfully springy texture. Insistently bouncy, it delightfully gives some resistance when chewed. A small morsel of Japanese Spanish mackerel (sawara) is marinated in a sweet, smoky miso in the portion of sawara saikyo yaki. Packed with flavour, it is the most arresting across the array. Unifying ingredients of mustard and miso are also present in the firefly squid. The depth of umami layers counters the smooth oceanic quality of the tiny, curling tendrils of the squid, while the head is stuffed with a cephalopod concentration. Approaching the stem of the leaf, bright orange pearls of soy marinated ikura lie in a bed of intensely bitter and sharp daikon radish hair. Somewhat larger, the sweet fish roe is slightly more developed than most, giving a more robust tang and a more emphatic pop.\\nKintsugi KL – Mukozuke\\nNo kaiseki is complete without Mukozuke, or a platter of seasonal premium sashimi. Chef Ramsey speaks openly about the ageing processes included in Kintsugi’s kitchen. Dry ageing deepens and intensifies the flavour of the fish, while also removing the ‘fishy’ smell through the removal of excess moisture. The bigger, the fattier the fish, the better it reacts. Some salmon and tuna can be aged for up to two weeks, while white, flakier fish can be difficult to age past five days. When working with some of Japan’s most sought after and exorbitantly priced fish, the use of a dry-ager adds an additional level of distinction.\\nOn our plate today, we are enjoying bluefin tuna from Nagasaki in Western Japan. Filleted in thick steak cuts, the flesh is supple and strong. With a higher fat content than other tunas, there is an intensity in flavour that is surprising. We also have an aged sawara from the Kochi prefecture. It melts in the mouth, smoother, softer, flaking apart. Fresh wasabi cleanses the palate before we take on the full sensation of the sashimi style botan ebi, or jumbo sized sweet prawns. The final portion of seafood in the sashimi platter is karasumi, much like Italian bottarga. Named for it’s similar appearance to Chinese ink sticks, mullet roe is cured and sliced into miniature steaks. It’s texture is almost sticky, though without adherence. The Mukozuke selection is rounded out with spicy red water pepper, curls of dried watermelon radish, and white tendrils of daikon radish, along with a stalk of perilla shiso leaves.\\nThe next step is the Mushimono, or steamed dish. The team has prepared a bowl of kegani (horsehair crab) and truffle chawanmushi, served in an intricately painted cup with a lid to capture the heat. The silken, savoury egg of the chawanmushi is covered in a layer of clear, thickened broth, infused with truffle. It fills the mouth with flavour, yet is like eating a cloud – dispersing as something wholly liquid while still solid in the mouth, holding it’s custardy shape until the moment it disperses. Beautifully crafted, finely frilled shavings of truffle hang suspended in the custard and broth, not quite floating to the top or sinking to the bottom. They stay in stasis, perfectly in equilibrium. The kegani is inexplicable, drawn to the front of the palate before melding into the background.\\nJapanese amberjack, or yellowtail buri is the central star of our next dish, as we move onto a representation of winter through Yakimono. Grilled over heat, the thick cut of premium high-grade buri has a faint vinegar-like taste, with a sweet soy moment. The dish has both hot and cold elements: the grilled buri is accompanied by a daikon radish snow, dressed with a transparent soy sauce so as not to disrupt the pure white colour. The iciness of the powdered snow counters the heat of the daikon, dissolving instantly on the tongue and leaving a waft of chilled air with each breath. The dish is garnished with hair-like curls of dried seaweed shavings, as well as the petals of the perilla flower.\\nKintsugi KL – Sushi\\nBringing out a highly lacquered serving platter, it’s time for the sushi preparation. Each mouthful is reflected on the mirror-like shine of the high gloss dish. Front of house supervisor, Dash, produces hand-cleaning cloths, and indicates the best method to clean fingertips between sushi dishes, in order to rid any residue. The practice preserves the flavours of the next piece of sushi. Previously an air steward with Malaysian Airlines, Dash’s gentle instruction and close attention to detail evoke a sense of first-class service.\\nWe begin with aori eka, or Japanese bigfin reef squid, topped with yuzu zest, a touch of lemon juice, and Bario salt from the Bornean highlands. It’s best to upend the sushi before placing it in the mouth, with fish to tongue. This way, we taste the featured flavours first, and finish with the light sweetness of the rice. Two types of ginger are served in small bowls, one thinly sliced, and one using the whole tuber, adding heat where desired.\\nAji horse mackerel is next, cured with Kintsugi’s house soy sauce, and served with spring onion. This portion almost looks like Kintsugi’s namesake itself, its back split down the middle, splashed with glints of silver skin, it appears as a seam of metal. The addition of spring onion brings faint heat against the slightly cooler temperature of the rice.\\nThe third piece is blackthroat seaperch, or akamutsu. The fish is like eating a ribbon of silken fat, pure in flavour. Unlike indulging in unhealthy high-fat red meats, fish such as akamutsu is rich with omega-3 fatty acids, crucial for brain development. Linked to reduced risk for many diseases, these healthy fats can potentially lower the risk of stroke and heart attack. Health benefits aside, it is sublimely delicious. It’s topped with grated radish and red cabbage juice. Using a pair of foot long metal chopsticks, Chef precisely guides droplets of lime juice onto the purple garnish, and we watch as it morphs from a lilac purple to a magenta pink.\\nWe break between sushi rounds to enjoy a prawn head and nameko mushroom miso soup. The prawn head sits proudly in the middle, surrounded by little umbrella-shaped nameko mushrooms floating in a cloudy miso paste soup. The mild butterscotch mushrooms give a nutty, fruity lift to the concentrated prawn taste.\\nMalaysian Flag Sushi\\nCarrying on with the theme of prawns, Chef Ramsey explains he has dubbed our next sushi portion the Malaysian Flag. The red and white stripes of a fresh prawn are splayed on top of its cuboid of rice. Hidden inside, the natural blue seam of the prawn represents the combined colours of the flag. More secrets are yet revealed in this piece. The thick bodied outer prawn covers an inner puree of undiluted grilled prawn, its incredible richness and depth a distillation of unadulterated prawn flavour.\\nThe final of our five sushi portions requires some audience participation. Holding our hands out, a round nori sheet is placed in our palms. Layering on rice and wasabi, it’s then topped with four tongues of vibrant orange bafun uni, or sea urchin. Creamy and with a delicate texture, it has a just perceptible bitter brininess.\\nJapanese Dorayaki pancakes make up the first Mizumono dessert plate. Served in a woven basket with the dark, shiny green outer skin preserved, the pancakes lie on a bed of fresh pine needles and the faint scent of fir balsam makes itself quietly known. It is the scent of late Autumn, early Winter. Sandwiched between the ultra-fine, crisp casing is a red bean paste inner. Satiny smooth and naturally sweet, the paste is also somewhat savoury, redolent of finishing a meal with a fine cheese platter.\\nGrown in winter rather than in summer, Japan’s tochiotome strawberries are juicy and plump, with a balance of sweet and sour. In the Japanese Strawberry and Milk, a large, whole tochiotome strawberry is quartered and stood on its end, supported with a finely diced strawberry puree. Perched on top is a delicate shard of sugar crystal, representing the glasshouses the strawberries are grown in. On a bed of almond crumble is a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a crisp powdered sugar snowflake biscuit, reminding me of Japan’s powdery ski fields. The base of this winter wonderland dish is a milk mochi glaze sauce, thick and tacky with a sweet, condensed milk flavour.\\nKintsugi KL Review\\nKintsugi is now open for lunch and dinner on the third floor of Isetan, in the Gardens Mall. Typically a lunch meal lasts 45 mins to an hour, yet it feels like a slow, well-paced interjection in your day. If you would prefer to savour each moment and take your time, the dinner seating provides a more extensive rendering of modern traditionality. The rituals of a kaiseki ceremony at Kintsugi will have you present for each moment, transporting you through the Japanese seasons. In all aspects of your experience, the elegance of wabi-sabi is present – a centuries-old Japanese philosophy of embracing the beauty of imperfection. Like the art of Kintsugi, a dining experience with Chef Jeff Okada Ramsey is a porcelain sculpture of culinary experience, seamed in gold. The wealth lies in the artistry and refinement required to make the ancient new again.\\nReasons to visit Kintsugi KL: beautifully designed interior, premium ingredients and a world-class experience.\\nKintsugi KL – Japanese Restaurant\\nThe Table, Isetan, The Gardens Mall\\n3F, Lingkaran Syed Putra, Mid Valley City\\n59200 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\\n+6010 381 1330\\nKintsugi Kuala Lumpur Opening Hours\\nTuesday to Sunday: 12 pm – 3 pm & 6 pm – 11 pm',\n",
       " '2021 is the year in which I mainly wanted to work on 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. That planning dates back to even before the start of the corona pandemic. And you could say: such long-term planning shouldn’t cause you any problems in the pandemic, Thilo, because most people suffered from the fact that they didn’t had a plan for tthat time – or had to change or cancel all their plans. That is certainly true.\\nAnd yet I can say that keeping this planning up and runnig has been extremely difficult. Because it was made for a world that shouldn’t change at the same time. I thought in 2019 that in 2021 I would be working in conditions similar to those in 2019. For known reasons, this did not happen. In addition to the high workload with this graphic novel, there were so many additional topics: The professional world that I work in did change severely. The worries you had about friends, distant relatives and family. And and and. You had to keep pace with all of this, and that was an extra job of a magnitude difficult to fit in making a comic book like this of over 200 pages.\\nNevertheless, I managed to stay on schedule and can now happily announce that I am not sooo far away from the last page. At the moment I’m sitting on the crucial and notorious scene with the giant squids (yes, there are actually more than one), an excerpt of which can be seen here. The scene is also a lot of fun, but it’s tough (I’m just saying: lots of tentacles) and also quite long. But I am very confident that I will make it. I just hope I’ll get my new computer glasses soon :).',\n",
       " 'SonoVive is a state-of-the-art natural solution to a multitude of hearing problems and ailments along the ears, as well as a booster to support overall brain health. This supplement is rich in a variety of nutrients and has been scientifically proven to be beneficial to people who might have issues with their hearing or cognition.\\nWe all are well aware that hearing is a crucially integral part of our lives – it’s among the most essential senses any human could ever have alongside taste, smell, touch, and sight. Without hearing, we wouldn’t get to experience life in all its glory. While some, unfortunately, suffer from deafness, it’s hard to deny that having the ability to hear can further enhance one’s point of view.\\nSonoVive could help you if you are slowly losing your hearing because of old age, misuse or other causes.\\nFor those of you who prefer a more visual experience, here is a video review from Fat Burning Guide’s YouTube channel. Do check out our article below, however, because it has a comprehensive overview of SonoVive.\\nWhat is SonoVive? Book On Hearing Loss Cure\\nSonoVive is an oral dietary supplement that helps people with hearing difficulties. Each ingredient is safe and almost all natural and is carefully formulated to support inner ear health and brain health. As expected, it is rich in remarkable nutrients geared towards a more compelling sense of hearing and adept comprehension.\\nSonoVive is a worthwhile addition to individuals who may be subject to any of the following: loud environments, old age, or pre-meditated health conditions. It is the work of Dr. Sam Olson, a certified medical chemist whose extensive knowledge of plant medications led him to develop a no-frills and quick-easy solution to a multitude of hearing and cognitive complications.\\nHow does SonoVive work?\\nSonoVive works with the primary premise of maintaining health in the ear’s auditory nerve connected to the brain, which serves as a key in repairing damaged parts of the ear as a whole. This ensures that everything, from hearing capabilities to cognitive functions, is kept in the best possible condition. This supplement protects your ears against inevitable infections due to a variety factors, such as excessive wax buildup or injured eardrums.\\nSonoVive’s nootropic ingredients are essential for stimulating and activating the brain’s neural network, improving their health, function, and overall wellbeing. You may or may not be aware of this, but your cognition is equally just as important as your sense of hearing, which is why SonoVive does its best efforts to keep you fully engaged wherever and whenever.\\nA perfectly functioning connection between the brain and your ears is what gives you good hearing. The aural supplement makes sure it stays as it is, further lessening the chances of experiencing total hearing loss and deafness. Let’s look closer at hearing loss to better understand what we are doing.\\nHearing Loss: What is it?\\nAccording to the American National Institute on Health, hearing loss is a common problem caused by noise, aging, disease, and heredity. Although it is common in older people, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is an uncommon condition. No matter your age, hearing loss can affect anyone.\\nThere are two common types associated with hearing loss. These are considered either conductive or sensorineural.\\n- Conductive hearing loss is when noises are unable to pass through the middle ear to the outer ear. This category is often associated with sound loss. However, medication and surgery can help to treat it.\\n- Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by the damaging of the inner ear and/or auditory nerves which would have connected an essential part of the body to the brain. It has been feared by most people as it’s neither fully curable nor reversible and can often lead to full deafness if left untreated. That doesn’t stop those who suffer from this type of hearing loss, however, as specially-made hearing aids are available.\\nSonoVive’s formula of ingredients and compounds was thoroughly tested and reviewed by a team medical and scientific professionals. All elements in this section, with the exception of one, have been organically sourced. The supplement was created in a GMP-certified (Good Manufacturing Practices), factory.\\nEach ingredient has many positive effects on hearing and cognitive function. Let’s now take a closer look at each one.\\n- Ginkgo Biloba\\nGinkgo biloba, a Chinese herb medicine that has roots back to China, has been shown to improve brain function, memory and attention span. It improves the connectivity of neurons within the brain and allows for smoother neural transmissions. Gingko biloba essence is rich in nutrients that can be used to improve blood circulation and overall health.\\n- St. John’s Wort\\nAlso known by its scientific term ‘Hypericum perforatum’, the St. John’s wort flower produces a type of oil that’s enriched with anti-inflammatory properties. This extract aids in the relaxation of a wide range of muscles in the body as well as faster healing of wounds and bruises. It can reduce irritations from ear infections. It can soothe nerve functions, which is a useful addition for those who suffer from anxiety, depression, or other mental disorders. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\\n- Bacopa Monnieri\\nThe bacopa monnieri plant, known as Brahmi in India, has been used for centuries by Ayurvedic medical practitioners as a treatment for the improvement of cognitive functions and even further prevention of nerve ailments such as anxiety and epilepsy. It’s packed with an abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory traits, both needed in nourishing brain cells. Bacopa monnieri can improve the condition of the auditory nerves that connect the brain to the ear.\\nVinpocetine was originally developed as a chemical substitute for the extract found in the periwinkle plant and has been sold in Europe as a medical drug under the name Cavinton. Outside of Europe, it’s included as an ingredient in special dietary supplements that aim to improve brain function, like SonoVive, for instance, though it has yet to receive approval from the US FDA. Vinpocetine, despite being man-made and having a vague classification from established food or drug agencies, has strong neuroprotective components that could help to steer the brain away further damage. Apart from treating cognitive issues such as hearing loss and memory loss, its power as a nootropic substance can increase the blood from the brain to other parts of the body.\\n- Huperzine A\\nAn organically sourced chemical extracted from Chinese club moss, Huperzine A can cure users with ear infections along with a variety of hearing problems. It can improve the brain’s functions, helping users to think critically and make better decisions. It is unclear whether this element can bring positive attributes to other cognitive illnesses and issues such as Alzheimer’s disease, as there is not much scientific research so far about it. We do know that Huperzine A can be used to treat age-related issues. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\\nL-glutamine is a type of amino acid that has a special role to stimulate the brain to produce neurotransmitters for silky smooth coordination between the brain and ears. Its properties can also aid in the development of stronger muscles. The body’s overall health is a key function of amino acids. Amino acids are building blocks. They look like stacks of bricks used in the construction of buildings. Amino acids offer the body a wide range of benefits, from heart and lung health to hair and nail regrowth.\\nMyelin sheath protects the nerve cells of the brain that are interconnected. It is a fatty layer similar in appearance to an electrical cord, with all the wires inside. The myelin sheath can gradually lose its existence due to aging. This leaves nerve cells vulnerable. Phosphatidylserine, a fat-like substance, helps to replace the lost and thinned parts of the layer, further ensuring that nerve cell activities stay intact no matter what. The presence of phosphatidylserine is vital in maintaining the person’s hearing conditions as well as their overall brain health.\\n- Acetyl L-Carnitine\\nAcetyl L-carnitine is derived from L-carnitine and naturally occurs in the human body. It is responsible for converting fats into energy as part of a process called metabolism. Although the body already has enough acetyl L carnitine, it is known to have many nootropic benefits. It is used to treat a number of cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and nerve pain in people with diabetes. It’s also known to treat those with depression thanks to its metabolic properties. There isn’t much research on acetyl Lcarnitine, but it can improve hearing and increase blood flow.\\nSonoVive: The Benefits\\nSonoVive’s specially formulated mix can provide those with hearing problems with a ton of major improvements from within the ears. Upon consistent regular use of this supplement, you may notice huge leaps in difference. For instance, you find yourself having a hard time listening to one of your close friends at first, even from far away. As you use SonoVive, you may slowly notice that your hearing has become crystal clear, and you would then be able to recognize your friend’s voice, particularly when both of you are a few more feet apart from each other. SonoVive may help you be more attentive to sounds and noises, no matter where you are.\\nNatural factors such as age and irritation can lead to hearing loss. However, certain conditions or ailments may also contribute to the problem. SonoVive’s anti-inflammatory attributes serve a vital role in the reduction of further pain and discomfort from a wide variety of ear infections. Its antioxidant properties contributed by half of its ingredients also play a part in fixing hearing problems caused by oxidative stress. Your eardrum can also be affected by noise and other factors, such as wax buildup from trying to clean it with a Q-tip. Too much may result in damage and infections – thankfully, SonoVive has enough properties to prevent it from happening further. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\\nA better sense of hearing means a more functioning brain system. SonoVive is known for its neuroprotective and nootropic properties. They can be used in many ways to improve the brain’s cognitive function. With SonoVive, you get to focus more attentively on your work, hobbies, and other activities without feeling lost then and there, remember past events as clear as day, and feel a stronger sense of whatever you love to do. A surge in mental health is also possible. Losing your hearing ability can lead to anxiety and depression. SonoVive’s ability to improve hearing and cognition lowers the risk of developing potentially deadly diseases like Alzheimer’s.\\nMoreover, SonoVive also has other kinds of benefits in store, such as:\\n- 100% safe formulation of ingredients with no trace of allergens such as soy and nuts\\n- Supplements contain no toxic stimulants or risky ingredients that could put users at risk\\n- Cost-effective pricing, with a range much more affordable than the otherwise expensive medical procedures and devices such as hearing aids\\n- Stellar discounts and a 60-day risk-free refund policy\\nSonoVive Side Effects\\nSonoVive is safe and recommended for daily use. It should not cause any serious side effects. These side effects can only occur if the correct dosage is used.\\nSonoVive uses only natural ingredients, with the exception of Vinpocetine. Although this substance is artificially manufactured, it still has the same properties and framework as the organic substitute in the Periwinkle plant. Therefore, it can be consumed in complete safety.\\nHow to Use SonoVive\\nSonoVive contains 30 capsules per bottle, and each is highly recommended to be taken once a day. Adults over 18 years old should take it. To ensure you’re taking the correct steps, consult your doctor if you have hearing issues or any other medical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.\\nFor any questions or doubts, you can always contact a physician or SonoVive’s hotline for advice. SonoVive can be used to treat hearing loss in one person, but it may not work for others due to the composition of its ingredients. It is not recommended for pregnant and actively breastfeeding women, as well as minors under the age of 18.\\nThese are some other things you need to know if you decide to use SonoVive.\\n- You must set a specific time of day that works best whenever you take the recommended dosage – you may opt to consume it after breakfast or lunch, for instance. You will see better results if you use it consistently.\\n- Exceedive consumption of more than one capsule per daily may cause irritation in the ears or other parts of your body. Excess consumption of certain ingredients such as St. John’s wort extract, for example, may leave you more prone to sunburn.\\n- SonoVive should not be used by people who are bleeding at high risk or take anticoagulant medications. These may interact with the product and may cause unpleasant reactions in the body.\\n- You must discontinue taking SonoVive 2-3 weeks before your scheduled surgery or medical procedure, as it may cause excessive bleeding on your end.\\n- Some of the supplement’s ingredients may potentially cause fertility issues, especially among men. SonoVive may not be recommended for you if you are trying to have a baby with your partner.\\n- Results may vary from one person to another, so results might take a few weeks. Premeditated medical conditions, age, and lifestyle all play a role in the time it takes for your results to show. As much as possible, it’s best to wait at least three months to see them come to fruition.\\nScientific Evidence: How Effective is It?\\nSonoVive’s ingredients have been carefully considered and selected based on evidence from journals and studies published by prestigious universities and research centers. Rest assured that you’re in good hands, knowing that each element has proven to bring generally positive attributes to those who use it. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\\nGinkgo biloba has been extensively researched and studied many times. Most of these studies have shown positive results. One journal specifically notes its cognitive benefits for those with mild memory impairments or Alzheimer’s disease.\\nSt. John’s wort, on the other hand, has been found to have elements that may contribute to relieving the symptoms patients with depression and other related mental illnesses often experience. Studies in German-speaking regions have shown that the genetic structure of the flower can boost the production of dopamine and other positive neurotransmitters. This creates a placebo effect similar with antidepressant drugs. What makes St. John’s wort a little superior over the latter is that it creates fewer side effects.\\nPrice range and where to buy\\nYou may purchase the SonoVive dietary supplement from its official website at sonovive.com. There, you can select from the three packages below that Dr. Olson and his team take pride in offering. Free shipping is included in all available stocks, so you won’t have to worry much about the additional costs that may affect your wallet.\\n- One bottle costs $69 each.\\n- The cost of a three-bottle package is $177 with $59 per unit. This bundle saves you $120 compared to buying three quantities of the original price.\\n- The six-bottle package is $294 and costs $49 each. Purchase six bottles at the original price and you can save $300.\\nStill skeptical about its effectiveness? SonoVive comes with a guarantee money-back policy. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can return the bottles or get a refund. It’s only valid for 60 days after the initial purchase. If you ever conclude that the supplement doesn’t work for you, you can ask SonoVive’s contact services within the given timeframe.\\nAfter taking a close and thorough inspection of SonoVive and what it could do to affect one’s hearing and cognitive processes, we have concluded that it is, indeed, an ideal choice as extra support for your ear and brain health. Though Dr. Sam Olson and his team have not yet fully proven its effectiveness as a supplement, they are confident that nearly all the ingredients mixed into its formulation can bring forth amazing benefits to the person’s way of living.\\nSonoVive is organic, allergen-free and generally safe to use. While we are pleased with the product’s potential to deliver great results, it is not something you can rely on. You should also take precautions to prevent total hearing loss. Book On Hearing Loss Cure\\nAre you convinced SonoVive could solve your hearing or thinking problems? You can decide for yourself!\\nFAQ Book On Hearing Loss Cure\\nHow is SonoVive made? Is it made in a safe facility?\\nSonoVive capsules come mainly from nature and are further tested in the lab. They are then manufactured in an FDA-certified factory using secure and sterilized processes. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), are used during manufacturing. This ensures that the product you receive is safe and secure.\\nHow long should I continue taking SonoVive for?\\nIt will depend on how severe a user’s condition is. If you are in good health, chances are the results might come to you within a minimum of a few weeks from first use. It may take six months, or longer, if it is not.\\nApart from SonoVive, what else should I do to further prevent hearing problems?\\nWe all know you shouldn’t fully rely on SonoVive to fix issues with your hearing, so you must take early precautions firsthand to prevent them until it gets worse. You must avoid loud noises and vibrations from hearing devices and speakers. Taking a break from using headphones or earphones is also a plus. Book On Hearing Loss Cure',\n",
       " 'The campfire isn’t just for roasting marshmallows or flipping burgers anymore. It’s also a great time for the adults to relax and have some fun with the best campfire drinking games around. These are a great way to cure the boredom of singing the same old campfire songs.\\n1. Beer Pong: The infamous college drinking game that made its way to the wood burning fire pit. Items needed are beer, a long table, sleeves of plastic cups, and ping pong balls. Place ten cups filled half-way with beer and arranged in bowling pin style at both ends of the table. Each team or person is to stand at opposite ends of the table and make the ping pong ball into the opponent’s cups. If this happens, the opponent has to drink. If neither team or person makes it, reset and start again. The game is played until one team has consumed all the beverage in every cup.\\n2. Cornhole: A new game using the classic bean bag. Items needed are beer or alcoholic beverage, two groupings of four like-colored bean bags, and two long wooden platforms that are raised slightly at one end with a hole just large enough for the bean bag. If a team or person makes a bean bag into the opponent’s hole the opponent has to drink. The rules can be altered to include knocking your opponent’s beanbag off the board or into the hole.\\n3. Polish Horseshoes: This is a very challenging game, especially if you are already a little tipsy. Items needed are beer, two poles, empty beer bottles and a frisbee. Set the poles in the ground at opposite ends of the playing area and carefully balance the empty beer bottles on top. If a team knocks the bottle off the opposing side, the opponents have to drink. If one team saves a bottle from hitting the ground the opponents also have to drink.\\n4. Dizzy Bat: A relay game that’s very entertaining to watch as well as participate. Items you will need are beer or alcoholic beverage and a bat. Each person has to chug their drink and rotate ten times with one bat end to the ground and the other end to their forehead. Run to the opposite end of your playing area and back then tagging your teammate to do the same thing. The first team to complete the relay are the winners.\\n5. The Alphabet Game: A great game to bone up on the alphabet and get a little drunk. All you need is beer or an alcoholic beverage. Players will sit in a circle around the wood burning fire pit and determine a theme. For example, if the theme is cities then a player will say a city that starts with an “A” and so on down the alphabet. But, the next player in the circle has to remember all the cities from the prior players and add his own. The first player to forget a city or loses their place has to drink.\\n6. I Went On A Picnic: The same rules apply as The Alphabet Game, only the player says the phrase, “I went on a picnic and I brought an item”. The item would correlate with the next letter of the alphabet. The next player would have to remember all the items the previous players brought to the picnic and add his own to the list. The first one to forget the list has to drink.\\n7. I Never: This game is built on honesty and might be a little embarrassing. Items needed are beer or an alcoholic beverage and trust. One person says an “I Never” statement. For example, I’ve never swum naked. The people who’ve swum naked need to drink. Set a determined amount of rounds.\\n8. Drinko: A game played like the famous Plinko. Items needed are five different drinks. Out of these drinks, two of them need to be a little gross and three of them can be delicious alcoholic beverages or beer, a slanted wooden board with a staggered peg system, ping pong balls, and a table. Line the five drinks down at the bottom of the board and the player drops the ping pong ball from the top of the board and down through the pegs. Whatever drink it lands in at the bottom is what the player chugs.\\n9. Cup Swap: You have to have a steady hand in this game. Items needed are beer or an alcoholic beverage, plastic teaspoons, and a sleeve of plastic cups. Players will get two cups and one teaspoon. One cup will be empty and one filled with beer or alcoholic beverage. They’ll have one minute to spoon as much as they can out of the full cup and into the empty cup. What is left in the first cup with the beverage will have to be chugged at the end of the minute.\\n10. Sip, Sip, Shot: A game that’s a take on the original Duck, Duck, Goose. Items needed are some insane campers and plenty of alcohol. Just sit in a circle around the campfire and let the fun begin!',\n",

       " 'Having identified the name of a Sicilian immigrant ancestor, you’re prepared to search for records that may give his date of immigration and/or his date and place of birth. These may be contained in family records such as passports, marriage records, naturalization papers or membership documents of the mutual aid societies, or Società di Mutuo Soccorso that were so common in America for Sicilian immigrants.\\nIf these records aren’t available in your family, and if you know the approximate date of the ancestor’s death, check municipal and county libraries for archives of local newspapers that can be searched for obituaries, death notices or articles of the period, which may give information about your ancestor.\\nIf you know where the family settled when first in America, visit the County Clerk’s office in that jurisdiction, and ask to see any naturalization records they may have on file for members of your family. Naturalization papers, especially the Petition for Naturalization, can have a wealth of information, including the immigrant’s name, birth date and place, date and ship of immigration, the address of the applicant and the names and dates of birth of each member of his family.\\nStill no luck? Then it’s time to turn to US and/or state Census records. The first US Federal Census was in 1790, under Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. There have been 22 since then, taken at ten-year intervals. The last was in 2010. Censuses from 1790 through 1940 are available in hard copy at many sources, including local libraries and genealogical societies, except for the 1890 census, most of which was destroyed by fire. For privacy reasons, federal censuses are not released to the public until 72 years after they are made, making 1940 the most recent census available. You must know the community your family lived in during a given period, then search for the census or censuses that fall into that period.\\nThe census questions varied over the years, from simple identification and place of residence in 1790, to much more detailed information in later versions. Below is a list of questions from a typical US census, that of 1920, near the peak of Sicilian immigration to America:\\n• Relationship to head of family\\n• Age at last birthday\\n• Marital status\\n• If foreign born, year of immigration to the U.S., if naturalized and year of such\\n• School attendance\\n• Birthplace of person and parents [usually the country only]\\n• If foreign-born, the native tongue\\n• Ability to speak English\\n• Occupation, industry, and class of worker\\n• Was home owned or rented: if owned, was it mortgaged\\nIf you find your ancestor listed in such a census, you’ll find his immigration date and nationality, and be able to estimate his birth year by subtracting his age from the year of the census. Consider all dates approximate. They were not backed by documentation, but simply by the statement of the interviewee. Most libraries with hard copies of censuses cover only the city or county where the library is located.\\nIf your ancestor settled elsewhere, before the advent of the internet, you would have had to go to that place to search the census, or pay a local researcher to do it for you. Luckily, all US Federal Censuses through 1940 are now searchable and viewable on-line.',\n",

       " 'Orange County Kidnapping Crime Attorney\\nChances are, if you’re arrested for kidnapping, the prosecutor will seek harsh penalties and care little for your side of the story. Charges of kidnapping can apply to many situations you are not aware of, such as taking your own child away. Most defendants have no idea how they were breaking the law until they land in a jail cell.\\nWe understand that lines can be blurry and sometimes you end up on the wrong end of a misunderstanding. Facing charges of kidnapping can be stressful, with severe implications on your personal and professional lives. If you\\'re being accused of kidnapping, call Law Office of Michael L. Guisti at (714) 530-9690 or toll-free at (888) 478-8999 for experienced legal representation to help keep you out of jail. Our attorneys are here to help.\\nKidnapping is defined by Penal Code (PC) 207 as the use of force or fear to take a person and move that person a \"substantial distance.\" This can include cases in custody disputes where one parent removes a child from the care of another who does not have the legal right to do so. Especially in cases involving parents accused of kidnapping their own children, the lines can be blurry and a good defense can successfully dismiss charges or reduce penalties.\\nIn order to be convicted of the crime of kidnapping, a prosecutor must prove the following:\\n- You detained another person by means force or fear\\n- By using that force and/or fear, you moved the other person a \"substantial distance\"\\n- You were not within your legal right to custodianship\\nWhat is considered a \"substantial distance?\"\\nA \"substantial distance\" under PC 207 is a distance more than slight or trivial. However, you can still be tried and convicted of kidnapping if the movement increased the risk of physical or psychological harm, provided the opportunity to commit additional crimes, and/or decreased the likelihood of being caught.\\nWhile Penal Code 207 outlines the broad definition of kidnapping charges, there are also individual charges for specific scenarios. A common one is parental kidnapping, which can occur when one parent takes the child without the permission of the other parent, violating a custody agreement. Violating a court-ordered custody agreement is breaking the law and can lead to serious consequences: a charge of child abduction or Penal Code 278.5. This can occur whether a parent refuses to return a child to the other parent when they have joint custody or whether a parent refuses to allow the other parent to have court-ordered visitation time. In order to convict you, the prosecution must prove that:\\n- You attempted to “maliciously deprive” another parent of the child by luring or taking the child away;\\n- The child was under the age of 18;\\n- You did not have a right to custody at that time; and\\n- You intended to detain or hide the custody from the other parent.\\nHowever, there is an exception to this law. If the detaining parent believed that the other parent abused the child, then he or she could violate the custody agreement to protect the child so long as that parent contacted the proper authorities, including the district attorney, and filed for custody under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.\\nAnother common kidnapping charge is aggravated kidnapping, which applies when:\\n- The alleged victim suffers a great bodily injury while detained.\\n- The alleged victim is kidnapped during a carjacking.\\n- The alleged victim was under the age of 14 and the crime involved force, fear, or fraud.\\n- The kidnapping involved a ransom demand.\\nAggravated kidnapping is punished with an extensive prison sentence. In all cases, you should not hesitate to contact a skilled attorney who can explain your situation and advocate for the lightest possible sentence for you.\\nThe penalties for kidnapping are extremely serious. Under California’s Three Strikes Law, kidnapping can result in a strike on your criminal record, and you may be required to served 85% of your sentence. Kidnapping is also a crime of moral turpitude, meaning it can affect your immigration status. In most cases, it is a felony. The specific penalties include:\\n- Kidnapping: Up to three, five, or eight years in a California state prison and/or a fine of $10,000.\\n- Aggravated Kidnapping: Up to five, eight, or eleven years in a California state prison and/or a fine of $10,000.\\n- Parental Kidnapping/Child Abduction: Up to one year in an Orange County jail and/or a fine of $1,000 if charged as a misdemeanor, or up to two, three, or four years in a California state prison and/or a fine of $10,000 if charged as a felony.\\nIf you are granted probation, the court requires that you serve at least one year in a county jail.\\nThere are many scenarios in which an alleged kidnapping can be fought. An attorney at Law Office of Michael L. Guisti can help formulate a defense pertinent to your specific case and fight to reduce your criminal charges. Let us guide you through the legal process, represent you in and out of court, and provide you with the best possible options to make this complicated time much easier for you.\\nIn our experience, a strong defense against kidnapping charges may be that:\\n- You were falsely accused.\\n- You had not traveled a substantial distance.\\n- The alleged victim freely and voluntarily went with you.\\n- You were coerced by another individual to kidnap someone.\\n- You misunderstood the custody agreement, or you did not have a court-ordered custody agreement.\\n- You had lawful custody over your child.\\n- The other parent lost his/her parental right to custody or abused your child.\\nLaw Office of Michael L. Guisti has successfully represented clients all over Southern California in cases of alleged kidnapping.

       " 'A Natural Order Exists\\nThe increasing emphasis in Judaism on esoteric Kabbalistic cosmologies that basically negate the existence of the Universe by morphing it into God has tended to suppress any beliefs in a scientific order to the Universe.\\nThere are many valid Torah sources that emphasize the existence of a natural order that most Jews are subjected to. Regrettably there seems to be a trend in the last few hundred years to ignore or suppress such viewpoints.\\n\"...the majority of the Israelite nation save an elite few, without a doubt are under the control of nature and the heavenly forces...similar to other living creatures who are not subject to God\\'s providence individually, but only in terms of their species...\" (Sforno, commentary on Leviticus 13:47)\\n\"Hashem wants the natural order to remain functional...he thus allows idol-worshippers to naturally prosper in their idol worship, and even a righteous saint might be impoverished and afflicted, if nature so imposes.\" (Maharal, Commentary on the Pesach Haggada, at the word \"Hallelukah\")\\nA belief that most Jews are subjected to the natural order does not in any way have to promote atheism or negation of belief in Hashem’s providence over the world. On the contrary, the very existence of life in this world including man’s own existence depends very much on an intelligent Creator performing an enormous level of fine tuning of the physical laws and constants to allow us to exist.\\nTraditional Judaism placed a strong emphasis on a person’s requirement to guard their lives from random or natural misfortunes. The earlier rabbis, unlike many of the Kabbalistic “preachers” nowadays, believed that most people are subject to the natural order. This citation from Sefer Hachinuch sums it up well:\\n\"To remove obstacles and misfortunes from our surroundings, on this (Torah) says to make a guard-rail around your roof...so that no one will fall there...on this we say to make a wall and a fence near every obstacle. Hashem directs all the matters of man, and everything good or evil that He degrees is based on man\\'s merit or guilt...even so man must guard himself from all the random occurrences in this world because God built a world based on Nature, and decreed that fire burns and water extinguishes the flames...God gave man daas to guard himself from injuries...man is obligated to use his wisdom to guard himself from random occurrences...the majority of mankind in their sins do not merit a great deliverance, so the Torah commanded them to guard their surroundings so that random deaths don\\'t occur...whoever relies on a miracle then a miracle won\\'t be done for them etc etc.\" (Sefer HaChinuch, Parshas Ki Tsetseh, Mitzvah 538)',\n",

       " 'You may have heard us say at some point that there is no such thing as a trading holy grail. What we mean by this is that there are no trading approaches or systems that are 100% effective, allowing you to extract money from the markets at will and without risk (btw, if they did exist, no one would let you know about it).\\nSo….if you come across someone promising a fool-proof system to follow, our advice is to run.\\nThe only thing that is certain in trading is that it is uncertain. So, as traders, the best we can do is to subjectively define risk/reward based on hypotheses in the auction. Fortunately, since financial market fluctuations are based on human behavior, we can develop approaches to markets that have some degree of predictability.\\nWhen we statistically extract these behaviors, we can even create probabilities around behavior, allowing us to quantify the success of our trading ideas. We believe that if we can wrap a probability around the success of an outcome, that is an edge that we can use. It’s not a holy grail, but it is something that we can lean on.\\nTo illustrate, see this chart. What it tells us is that over the last 1000 trading sessions in Nasdaq futures there are behaviors that we can see with respect to the price range of the 1st hour of trade (we profile traders call this the “initial balance”.) Here’s what we learn:\\n- 408 out of 1000 sessions we only extended the initial balance higher\\n- 306 out of 1000 sessions we only extended the initial balance lower\\n- 230 out of 1000 sessions we extended the initial balance in both directions\\n- 56 out of 1000 sessions we didn’t extend initial balance at all\\nSo, from these results we can ask some interesting questions that will hopefully create some “aha” moments for you:\\n- 70% (408+306/1000=70%) of the time, when Nasdaq futures extend the initial balance, they only extend it in one direction. So, if you see range extension in one direction, what does that mean for the rest of the session?\\n- 5.6% of the time, Nasdaq futures remain completely inside their initial balance. So, if you are sitting at your screen and you see Nasdaq sitting inside the first hour range, what’s the likelihood that it will remain there?\\nThis is just a start of the types of thinking that is possible when you begin to wrap statistics around your trading. Hopefully, this spurs some ideas that you didn’t have before. BTW, these types of statistics can be pulled for any trading vehicle: stocks, futures, forex.\\nIt’s not a holy grail, and it’s not certain, but when we can quantify the likelihood of something happening, that is an edge. As traders, that’s the best we can do.\\nJosh & the TWP team\\nps. We reserve some slots each week to offer free 30 min consults with traders. They are first come/first serve.

       " 'I hope your read the post I just made under talks. This is an extension of that talk to help inspire a desire for the daily rosary. We need to remind ourselves of its power and we need to plainly be obedient to Our good Queen and Mother.\\nHere are the facts:\\nThe Power of the Rosary\\n\"The most holy Virgin in these last times in which we live has given a new efficacy to the recitation of the Rosary to such an extent that there is no problem, no matter how difficult it is, whether temporal or, above all, spiritual, in the personal life of each one of us, of our families, of the families of the world, or of the religious communities, or even of the life of peoples and nations, that cannot be solved by the Rosary. There is no problem, I tell you, no matter how difficult it is, that we cannot resolve by the prayer of the holy Rosary. With the holy Rosary, we will save ourselves; we will sanctify ourselves; we will console our Lord, and obtain the salvation of many souls.\" Conversation between Sr. Lucy of Fatima and Fr. Fuentes, Dec. 26, 1957\\n\"The Rosary is a powerful weapon to put the demons to flight and to keep oneself from sin…If you desire peace in your hearts, in your homes, and in your country, assemble each evening to recite the Rosary. Let not even one day pass without saying it, no matter how burdened you may be with many cares and labors.\" Pope Pius XI\\n\"Among all the devotions approved by the Church, none has been so favored by so many miracles as the Rosary devotion.\" Pope Pius IX\\n\"The Rosary is the most excellent form of prayer and the most efficacious means of attaining eternal life. It is the remedy for all our evils, the root of all our blessings. There is no more excellent way of praying.\" Pope Leo XIII\\nSt. Dominic prayed to Our Lady that she would force the devils who possessed a man to reveal the truth about devotion to Her. The devils were forced by Our Lady to reveal: \"Now that we are forced to speak we must also tell you this: Nobody who perseveres in saying the Rosary will be damned, because she obtains for her servants the grace of true contrition for their sins and by means of this they obtain God\\'s forgiveness and mercy.\"\\nSome Important Miracles of the Rosary\\nOf course we know that the Rosary is miraculous. We can see it in our own lives. This should give us great incentive to cling to our Blessed Mother and pray Her Rosary. She will ultimately lead us to Her Son - Her one goal! And finally to our salvation. Below are some very big miracles that should give America hope for \"a cleaning of the swamp\". We need our Republic back and we pray that Our Lady will help this country come back to God and lawfulness and be a beacon for the rest of the world.\\nBattle of Lepanto, 1571 - On Sunday, October 7, the Christian and Turkish fleets met in Lepanto Gulf, off the coast of Greece. The bitter battle finished with a brilliant victory of the Christians who where vastly outnumbered. That very evening Pope St. Pius V had at Rome a clear knowledge of this success. The same afternoon, the Confraternities of the Rosary, particularly in Rome, had marched through the streets in procession reciting the Rosary. This victory put an end to the naval power of the Turks and saved Christian Europe. To this day this victory has been attributed to the praying of the Rosary. The feast of “The Most Holy Rosary” is celebrated on October 7 now and the month of October is dedicated to the Most Holy Rosary.\\nRosary Miracle at Hiroshima - August 6th, 1945 There was a home eight blocks (about 1 kilometer) from where the A-Bomb went off in Hiroshima Japan. This home had a church attached to it which was completely destroyed, but the home survived, and so did the eight German Jesuit missionaries who prayed the rosary in that house faithfully every day. These men were missionaries to the Japanese people, they were non-military, but because Germany and Japan were allies during WWII they were permitted to live and minister within Japan during the war. Not only did they all survive with (at most) relatively minor injuries, but they all lived well past that awful day with no radiation sickness, no loss of hearing, or any other visible long term defects or maladies. Naturally, they were interviewed numerous times (Fr. Schiffer, a survivor, said over 200 times) by scientists and health care people about their remarkable experience and they say \"we believe that we survived because we were living the message of Fatima. We lived and prayed the rosary daily in that home.\" Of course the secular scientists are speechless and incredulous at this explanation - and they are sure there is some \"real\" explanation - but at the same time over 55 years later the scientists are still absolutely bamboozled when it comes to finding a plausible scenario to explain the missionaries’ unique escape from the hellish power of that bomb.\\nRussians Pullout of Austria, 1948 - After World War ll, the Allies turned over Catholic Austria to communist Russia. For three years the Austrian people endured this tyranny. Then, a Franciscan priest, Father Petrus, remembered how the Christians although greatly outnumbered had defeated the Turks at the Battle of Lepanto through the Rosary, and he launched a Rosary crusade. Through it 70,000 people, one tenth of the Austrian population, pledged to say the Rosary daily for the Soviets to leave their country. Austria was valuable to the Russians because of its strategic location, rich mineral deposits and oil reserves. Yet on May 13, 1955, the anniversary of the first apparition of Our Lady at Fatima, the Russians signed the agreement to leave Austria, and they did so without one person being killed and without one shot being fired. It is the only time that the militant atheistic forces of Marxism have ever peacefully left a country in which they held power. Military strategists and historians are baffled as to why the Russians pulled out. But we are not - it was the power of the Rosary.\\nThe Country That Saved Itself - Brazil 1962 - In 1962 there was a looming threat of communist takeover in Brazil. A woman there named Dona Amelia Bastos was known to have formed a Rosary rally among the Brazilian women there to do their part in opposing the looming threat. Their goal was simply to pray the Rosary in large groups asking the Virgin Mary for help in opposing the Communist takeover which the President of Brazil was leaning toward at the time. In Belo Horizonte 20,000 women reciting the rosary aloud broke up a Communist rally. In Sao Paulo, 600,000 women praying the rosary in one of the most moving demonstrations in Brazilian history, caused the President of Brazil to flee the country and not a single death was encountered, sparing the country from Communist takeover.\\nBernadette Porter is a Traditional Catholic, a wife of 42 years with 6 adult home-schooled children and 6 grandchildren.

       " 'Southern Utah is high on my list of places to get outside. With endless red-rock vistas and deep, scenic canyons, all under a deep blue sky, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere else with such beautiful terrain. There are so many stunning outdoor landscapes to see in Utah that it almost makes the rest of the 49 states seem like underachievers. And much of the wonder is in the southern portion of the state.\\nWe found quite a few towns that had more than their share of gorgeous scenery and fun things to do. A road trip spent driving the highways of southern Utah is a road trip you’ll remember; just as much for the landscape as for the towns and people you’ll come across. This area is unspoiled, and much of it off the beaten path, so unless you’re going at the height of tourist season, you won’t find places crawling with people.\\nSouthern Utah is almost a year-round destination, although, because I’m not a heat-lover, I don’t think I’d go in July or August. In winter, the temperatures were moderate and the crowds non-existent. Just keep an eye on the snow forecast. Spring and fall are also great times to visit. Here are some of our favorite southern Utah small towns, in no particular order.\\nSome of this information was obtained during a press trip. All opinions are my own.\\n1. St. George\\nSt. George is stunning. This city of about 85,000 may not technically be a small town but has a small-town feel. It’s convenient as a home base to some of Utah’s best national parks and has its own quite fabulous state park. This area of southern Utah is some of the prettiest country I’ve seen in the entire U.S.\\nIf you’re into visiting national parks like I am, you’ll be pleased to know that St. George is only an hour south of Zion National Park and just a little farther from Bryce Canyon National Park.\\nGetting to St. George is fairly easy. Many people take advantage of the St. George Regional Airport, which offers service from major airlines like United, American, and Delta. We decided to fly into Las Vegas and make the 2-hour drive north for our visit. One of the highlights of this drive is passing through the incredible Virgin River Gorge.\\nMy favorite way to spend time in St. George is outside. Pioneer Park has 52 acres of rock-climbing opportunities just waiting to be explored. After you’re done climbing, take a look around St. George’s historical features. Since the city was founded by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, you’ll be able to visit many church-related sites. Top of the list is the Brigham Young Winter Residence Historical Site, which is open 7 days a week. Also a must-see is the St. George Tabernacle.\\nI recently spent an incredible 2 days at Red Mountain Resort in Ivins. This serene wellness retreat has everything for your body, mind, and soul and is set amid a jaw-dropping location in gorgeous Ivins, Utah. Technically a suburb of St. George, Ivins is home to world-class spas and plenty of ways to have fun outdoors.\\nSnow Canyon State Park is a jewel and has accessibility right out the back doors of Red Mountain Resort. Snow Canyon easily competes with many of the national parks I’ve been to and might even be a national park itself were it not in a state that already has an incredible collection of five national parks. This 7,000+ acre state park offers miles of hiking trails, biking trails, and popular e-bike rentals located right on the outskirts of the park. Snow Canyon State Park is gloriously beautiful with sights seemingly around every corner. You’ll enjoy the almost 40 miles of hiking trails and 3 miles of paved walking and biking trails.\\nYou may recognize Snow Canyon State Park as it’s been a favorite location for filmmakers. Westerns like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Electric Horseman, and Jeremiah Johnson were all shot at least partly on location here.\\nPro Tip: If you book a stay at Red Moutain Resort, ask about the airport shuttle that will take you to the resort so you won’t need a rental car.\\nRight outside the west entrance of Zion National Park is the cute town of Springdale. With a population of less than 1,000, Springdale is a small town with a surprising number of good, local restaurants.\\nWe enjoyed an excellent dinner al fresco at Oscar’s Cafe. With homemade Mexican specialties, indoor and outdoor seating, and a casual vibe, this homey spot is a winner. I tried the salmon filet served on a bed of rice. The simple salmon was cooked to perfection. I could eat the accompanying stuffed poblano pepper daily. The pepper, filled with delicious cheddar mashed potatoes, corn, cilantro, onion, and red pepper mixture, is incredible.\\nAnother fun restaurant is the Bit and Spur. This restaurant and bar serves inventive southwestern cuisine and specialty margaritas, including my favorite prickly pear, as well as made-in-Utah spirits. Springdale is the perfect place to stay if you’re visiting Zion and the shuttle system in town lets you leave your car at the hotel and let them do the driving.\\nPro Tip: The Sol Foods Supermarket has a great deli. Try their soups.\\nKanab isn’t as well-known as some of the neighboring towns, and that’s a good thing. This town, home to about 5,000, is in the heart of some of the best outdoor adventures in the state. For starters, there are three national parks within a 3-hour drive: Zion, Bryce, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Plus, Kanab is known as the gateway to the super popular The Wave.\\nBut the town also has its attractions including one of the most amazing animal sanctuaries in the U.S. — Best Friends. This organization works to save thousands of animals every year. At their Kanab location, you can participate in tours of the facility or take an adorable pup for a walk. They also have activities for the kids.\\nCoral Pink Sand Dunes State Park is an amazing place to explore on foot or by ATV. Almost 90 percent of the dunes are open for riding so you’re sure to find a thrilling area. Kanab is just an hour and a half from St. George Regional Airport or 3 hours from Las Vegas.\\nTwo hours north of Kanab, tiny Escalante is home to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. If you’re looking for a vast, rugged, remote area where you can find solitude, this is your place. The monument is not nearly as popular as some of the nearby national parks, so you won’t see as many visitors and you might not see any people for hours, depending on when you go.\\nOne of the most popular things to do here is to check out Peek-A-Boo Slot Canyon. If you’re into photography, the changing light here makes for incredible shots. The location of the canyon is off the beaten path, so many people prefer to go with a local guide. There are also plenty of hiking trails to explore as well as unique, otherworldly terrain.\\nPro Tips: While there are roads through the park, most are not paved, and many aren’t suitable for two-wheel-drive vehicles or RVs. This is a very large, very remote area with few services and no cell service for the most part. Make sure you’re prepared and stocked up on essentials (and gas). And it’s always a good idea to share your itinerary with friends so someone knows your plan.',\n",
       " '- Often, the scales at the airport are not calibrated correctly. Purchase an electronic hanging scale for around $20 (e.g.Â American Weigh Scale American Weigh H-110 Digital Hanging Scale) and weigh-in at home. This way, youâ€™ll leave home knowing what your bag weighs and you may be able to avoid extra fees.\\n- Pack special items to evade extra fees. Cyclists have been doing this for years – packing their bicycle frame in one unmarked box and putting the wheels in another, then sending it all through the scanners. Airlines like to charge excessive fees for sporting equipment, so pack it so it’s not obvious. If you can pack the equipment in a normal-looking bag without fear of it being damaged, even better.\\n- Spread out the load by packing heavier items in different bags to avoid excessive weight charges.\\n- Use the free options with abandon. Strollers, car seats, and certain medical equipment flies free. If you put the car seat in an overlarge duffel (for easier carrying, of course), you can usually pack other items in with it without attracting notice.\\nYou can also check into the luggage shipping services offered by UPS and other pack-and-ship service providers.\\nAt last resort? Try an upgrade. First-class passengers rarely pay bag fees, and if you can upgrade for a decent price, you’ll also be more comfortable. Just make sure the airline offers free baggage checking with the upgrade.',\n",

       " 'In reference to London’s National Portrait gallery exhibition Vogue 100 – A Century of Style we take the opportunity to talk to talented photographer Henry Bourne about his contribution to British culture. Henry first caught my attention through images of his publication Arcadia Britannica published by Thames & Hudson last year. There is an amazing connection to rituals and masquerade through the rest of his personal work and also contribution to the fashion industry worth having a look.\\nTell me a little bit about yourself and your background.\\nI grew up and I’m based in London but I spend a lot of time in the Sussex countryside.\\nMy work has appeared in numerous exhibitions worldwide, including; ‘Folklore & Photography’, at the Towner Gallery for Contemporary Art 2012. ‘Modern British Folklore Portraits’ at the Central State Exhibition hall in St Petersburg. ‘Now & Then’ an exhibition of contemporary art and historical objects at Harris Lindsay London 2011 curated by Adrian Dannatt.\\nMy work is currently being exhibited as part of ‘Vogue 100: A Century of Style’ from 11th February – 22nd May 2016 at The National Portrait Gallery London.\\nMy work forms part of the National Portrait Gallery’s (London) permanent collection of portrait photography.\\nMy first monograph book ‘Arcadia Britannica, a Modern British Folklore Portrait’ was published in 2015 by Thames & Hudson.\\nI am a regular contributor to Vogue & Harper’s Bazaar magazines worldwide & T: The New York Times Style Magazine. My editorial work has also appeared in, amongst others, The Conde Nast Traveller, Numero, W, The Wall Street Journal Magazine, Wallpaper, The World of Interiors & Vanity Fair magazines.\\nMy portrait commissions include: Gillian Anderson, Tom Dixon, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tracey Emin, Zaha Hadid, the Mayor of London; Boris Johnson, Ralph Lauren, Carey Mulligan, Elizabeth McGovern, Steve McQueen, Grayson Perry, Richard Prince, Emeli Sande, Paula Rego and, Vanessa Redgrave. I have worked with advertising clients including: Hermès, Lancôme, Ralph Lauren, Paul Smith & UBS.\\nHow did the idea of the book Arcadia Britannica began? Is it an ongoing project? How did you collaborate with Simon Costin?\\nArcadia Britannica is an ongoing photographic portrait project, of some the individuals involved in the myriad of different British folklore traditions and customs, around the United Kingdom.\\nStarting in 2009, I traveled around the UK to various seasonal rites and folklore festivals to photograph the diverse mix of people who participate in these rituals. These unique traditions & customs are flourishing and evolving, and I wanted to document these particularly British individuals exactly as they are without further embellishment.\\nI decided that the best way to record this was to concentrate on the individuals rather than the perimeter events, working within a portable studio at each event, to link each event and the photographs together.\\nMy starting point was the Victorian Member of Parliament and amateur photographer Sir Benjamin Stone’s series of photographs within ‘Records of National Life and History Volume I: Festivals, Ceremonies and Customs’ and the collection of his photographs at the V&A Museum.\\nThe initial idea of a new 21st century British folklore portrait came from a discussion with my friend Simon Costin, designer and the director of the Museum of British Folklore, who is campaigning to raise funds and awareness for the UK’s first museum to exclusively cover British Folklore. In 2009, Simon Costin took a miniature Museum of British Folklore around the UK in an elaborately styled 1960’s caravan as part of the Museums journey towards a permanent home. Initially I accompanied him along with my portable studio and then went on both alone and with Simon to other events around the UK. He has been an integral part of the photographic project, suggesting events and sharing his contacts, enthusiasm and passion for British folklore. The project has been in collaboration with Simon, whose help and knowledge has been invaluable.\\n‘The Endless Cavalcade’(by Alexander Howard published in 1964) lists a British rite or ritual for every day of the year, there are now approximately 720 recorded events, rites and ever changing customs practiced in the UK each year.\\nBy no means are the photographs in Arcadia Britannica intended to be a comprehensive document of British Folklore today, but merely a snapshot of a small number of the individuals involved today and the photography for the project continues.\\nWho are the people behind the images?\\nThe people behind the images come from all walks of life including; nurses, builders, a Japanese translator, civil servants, business people, and the graphic designer of Hibernian football club, amongst others. A complete cross section of backgrounds and occupations appear within British Folklore. Wherever possible we captioned the subject’s professions within Arcadia Britannica.\\nWhat is about British folklore culture that fascinates you?\\nToday we find ourselves in the midst of a British folklore renaissance, a new surge of interest in all things folkloric, within music, art and fashion. There is a growing popular desire to reconnect with our heritage, nature and our environment, perhaps as a reaction against our on-line, yet impersonal technological age. British Folklore traditions and rituals have had a rather tame reputation to date, which is unfounded. There is a fascinating world of bizarre tales and characters, brimming with idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, together with a renewed modern 21st century populism and enthusiasm, coupled with British history and myth. Folklore is a living, evolving culture that doesn’t stand still; it adapts and references contemporary culture.\\nWould you consider expanding your project in other countries?\\nYes absolutely, many of these British rituals have similarities to those in Germany, France, Scandinavia, and many other countries and although mostly, the origins are unclear these events must have important links to one another. But for now I am concentrating on the UK as there is still so much still to cover here.\\nDo you think rituals are still important within the modern society or is it part of our heritage that is slowly fading away?\\nYes, ritual is still important and I think we find it reassuring. It enables us to both re-connect with the past and connect with the present.\\nDo you think this is something that can evolve and take new forms in order to adjust with today’s needs?\\nBy its nature Folklore’s origins are usually unclear and ever changing, adapting to contemporary society. Its current popularity could be a reaction to our consumerist age; it celebrates renewal, nature, and green environmental issues, all of which are thoroughly modern concerns.\\nThe Jack in the Green festival in Hastings is a good example of the evolution of a folklore event; first recorded around 300 years ago as a May Day celebration of the start of summer in Hastings, its roots are probably from the Romans and Celts celebrations of the beginning of summer. The Jack in the Green parade had all but disappeared by the start of the 20th Century. It was resurrected in 1983 and today is an ever-popular annual event with some new traditions as well as the old. Along with the traditional costumes (people dressed as milkmaids and chimney sweeps) there are new contemporary participants, often dressed in extravagant ‘tatter’ clothing decorated with foliage and flowers, and their faces painted green.\\nEven the Bonfire society’s Sussex bonfire celebrations have evolved. Guy Fawkes Night, that commemorates the events of the 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested whilst guarding explosives that his fellow plotters had placed beneath the Houses of Parliament in London.\\nIn celebration of King James’ survival of this attempt on his life, bonfires were lit around London. In 1850 in Lewes, the inclusion of the burning of a papal effigy began on Guy Fawkes Night, in protest at Pope Pius IX’s decision to try to restore the Catholic Church in England. In Lewis and Hastings today, it has become a fun night out, Papal effigies have been replaced by effigies of currently unpopular figures, usually politicians, along with the traditional Guy Fawkes.\\nThe annual Notting Hill London carnival is an example of a modern Folkloric event that is relevant to both the local and, more recently, a widespread London community that celebrates Caribbean London culture.\\nWhat is it about masquerade that captures your attention? I can see this is something that dominates your photographs both in your personal work but also in projects for clients such as Hermes.\\nEscaping from the ‘everyday’, disguise, dressing up, the taking on of another identity, fantasy, and hiding!\\nAre you working on a new project at the moment?\\nI have several projects on the go, one of which involves tracing and photographing my long lost family of Native American distant relatives that live in Canada, and the surrounding landscape and towns nearby.\\nMelissanthi Spei is an Athenian born fashion artist based in London.
